    "text": "Rob Crilly is a British journalist living in New York. He was the Telegraph's Afghanistan and Pakistan correspondent and was previously the East Africa correspondent for the Times. The opinions in this article are those of the author.\n\n(CNN) This election has provided excellent sport for a certain type of pompous Englishman in New York.\n\nWhen Liberals worried aloud about the rise of Donald Trump during the sort of echo-chamber dinner parties that cried out for mischief, it was always too tempting to lean forward in my chair, mutter something about the Kardashians, reality TV and how the political rise of a loud-mouthed show-off seemed the most natural thing in the world.\n\nFor good measure I would add that for British voters, the description \"presidential\" remained a put-down of a certain, gleaming-toothed style of politics.\n\nThe tables were turned in June, when the UK voted for its own brash populist, Nigel Farage . If the liberal, educated classes of New York hadn't seen Trump coming, then they also failed to see Brexit looming (which is why a friend had to get out of bed and race to the office at 3 a.m. to start shuffling money through the markets).\n\nI was inundated with sympathy. At least from those who had avoided me at dinner parties.\n\nAnd then came the overcompensation from hot-take columnists. If they had missed the rise of one right-wing populist movement, then they sure as hell weren't going to be wrong twice. Perhaps Trump was no political long-shot, but could upset the polls and win, ran the logic.\n\nIt was a trend: the year of the political outsider. Propelled by the anger of a forgotten underclass and a desire to turn back the clock, could the US be about to follow the UK in reaching an equally unlikely result?\n\nJUST WATCHED Brexit leader offers advice to Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Brexit leader offers advice to Trump 00:27\n\nThe most Brit-literate commentators even threw in the example of lowly Leicester City winning the kick-ball series as additional proof that history was no longer a guide to the future.\n\nAll of which is tempting to believe but proof of nothing.\n\nOf course there are parallels -- polarised electorates, concern about immigration and growing disdain for experts -- but the US isn't Britain, which lost its manufacturing base long before cheap Chinese imports and gave up its role as the world's policeman a century ago. British exceptionalism isn't what it was.\n\nAnd Donald Trump isn't Boris Johnson, with his establishment credentials, or even Nigel Farage, who, despite his basing of the well-monied political elite, has sat in the European Parliament since 1999.\n\n\"Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the US.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Nigel Farage on the appeal of Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Nigel Farage on the appeal of Trump 01:20\n\nRepublican royalty such as the Bushes have refused to endorse the candidate, and a slew of conservative papers have begun coming out for Hillary Clinton. Trumpism's racism, misogyny and Islamophobia, they say, is an ugly aberration.\n\nIn contrast, Brexit has been a long-standing article of faith for politicians on both the Left and Right in British politics. The two big parties have been split on Europe ever since Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973. A club for capitalists or socialism by stealth, depending on your view.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nEuroscepticism suffuses life in the UK. Every time we buy a pint of bitter in a pub or ask for a pound of bananas (straight or otherwise) in a greengrocer's, we are sticking one to those Europeans and their newfangled metric system. And we pay in sterling rather than euros.\n\nSure, Brexit may not have been predicted by the polls, but any cause that wins the backing of The Daily Telegraph, The Sun and The Daily Mail -- as well as my mum's university-educated, affluent neighbours in Kent -- was never a no-hoper.\n\nIn contrast, Trump's ugly brand of politics may have taken him further than anyone predicted. But to make the leap from Brexit to a Trump White House is to ignore an ocean of context between the US and UK.",

    "text": "Guangzhou, China The heart of Little Africa -- or Chocolate City , as it has been dubbed by some -- is not easy to locate without a tip-off.\n\nAt the foot of an unremarkable tunnel, peeling off the busy Little North Road, in Guangzhou, stands a place that just two years ago was totally unlike the rest of China.\n\nAngolan women carried bin bags of shopping on their heads, Somali men in long robes peddled currency exchange, Uygur restaurateurs slaughtered lamb on the street, Congolese merchants ordered wholesale underwear from Chinese-run shops, Nigerian men hit the Africa Bar for a Tsingtao and plate of jollof rice.\n\nDengfeng -- a previously quiet urban village, or chengzhongcun, in central Guangzhou -- had been electrified by migration, both from internal Chinese migrants and those from Africa.\n\nBy 2012, as many as 100,000 Sub-Saharan Africans had flocked to Guangzhou, according to Professor Adams Bodomo's book \"Africans in China \" -- if true, it would have been the largest African expat community in Asia -- all chasing the same dream of getting rich in China.\n\nToday, that dream is fading -- if not finished.\n\nOver the past 18 months, although concrete numbers are hard to come by, hundreds -- perhaps even thousands -- of Africans are believed by locals and researchers to have exited Guangzhou.\n\nA dollar drought in oil-dependent West African nations, coupled with China's hostile immigration policies, widespread racism, and at-once slowing and maturing economy, means Guangzhou is losing its competitive edge.\n\nA promised land?\n\nGuangzhou sits 120 kilometers (75 miles) north-west of Hong Kong, often laboring under a haze of stifling gray smog.\n\nAfricans began pouring into this landscape of factories, producing everything from washing machines to fake Levi's jeans, in the mid-1990s.\n\nChina's economy had recently opened up and, in 2000, Beijing hosted the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation , spearheading a campaign to court good relations with resource-rich African nations.\n\nAs Chinatowns emerged in Lagos and Conakry , more Africans started thinking about China.\n\nThe type of Africans who migrated to China, however, were different to those moving West, Roberto Castillo, a lecturer in African Studies at Hong Kong University, tells CNN.\n\n\"Those people [going to Europe] are usually disenfranchised, with no opportunities, looking to settle,\" he says. \"Africans in China are much more entrepreneurial. Many of them have the financial capability to move around and explore new places.\"\n\nIndeed, 40% of African migrants surveyed for \" Africans in China \" had received at least tertiary education. Some held a PhD.\n\nAs Somali trader Ali Mohamed Ali, a university graduate in insurance working in logistics in Guangzhou, says: \"My five brothers and sisters all went to Europe: they ended up as cab drivers or security guards.\"\n\nHeading East, he says, there was opportunity for something greater.\n\nMadina Diallo says that in 2002 he would export 250 containers a year, containing everything from mattresses to pop corn machines. By selling these goods in his native, Guinea, he could make up to $1,500 on each container, or $375,000 a year -- a genuine fortune in a nation where the gross national income per capita is $470\n\nOther entrepreneurial Africans set up cargo shipping firms operating out of the the Port of Guangzhou.\n\nFake goods were also a cash cow.\n\nMoustapha Dieng, a former airplane engineer in the Senegalese air force, says that in the early 2000s, Africans were \"still importing original Nike and Adidas from the United States\".\n\n\"When we started buying fake goods from China, we could sell them in Senegal for the same price [as the real American goods]. Nobody knew about China and its fakes. Our profit was more than 100%.\"\n\nGuangzhou became a promised land, and more Africans arrived.\n\nThe Little Diplomats\n\nFelly Mwamba is one of Guangzhou's \"little diplomats\".\n\nEach African country has an \"ambassador\" in the Chinese city -- voted for by expatriates from that nation -- who liaises with the Chinese police, arbitrates internal disputes, and organizes community events.\n\nFelly Mwamba, head of the Congolese community in Guangzhou\n\nThe ambassador also keeps track of the population of his community; migrants usually informally register with their community leader upon arrival in Guangzhou, for support.\n\nMwamba says that in 2006 there were 1,200 Congolese in Little Africa. Today he believes that figure has plummeted to 500.\n\n\"Ambassadors\" for Guinea and Senegal report similar drops.\n\nEmmanuel Ojukwu, the self-proclaimed Head of Africans in China, and the ambassador of the Nigerian community -- one of the largest African groups in Guangzhou -- is despondently spread out on a sofa inside a clothing warehouse, where the halls are eerily devoid of customers.\n\n\"So many people went home at Christmas and did not return,\" he says.\n\nEmmanuel Ojukwu, head of Africans in China\n\nThe true scale of the African population in Guangzhou is hard to ascertain due to the itinerant nature of many traders -- some enter and exit the city multiple times per year -- and the thousands who overstay their visas.\n\nCastillo believes the Chinese government itself has no accurate idea of the African population's size, although at the height of the Ebola crisis in late 2014, it said just 16,000 Africans called the city home.\n\nThe streets of Little Africa certainly seem quieter than when I first visited 2 years ago.\n\n\"There is, indeed, an apparent lessening number of Africans in the city,\" says Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who has studied globalization in Guangzhou.\n\nChina losing competitive edge\n\nOne reason the Chinese dream is today failing Africans is the maturing Chinese economy.\n\nFirstly, as China's profile rose globally, African consumers realized they were buying bootleg not bona fide goods, and naturally wanted to pay less, says Dieng.\n\nPhotos: Little Africa before \"beautification\" in 2014 Little Africa before beautification \u2013 The Overseas Trading Mall sign dominated the skyline of Dengfeng village, in 2014.

I just do the business with them.\"\n\nMatthews says: \"The Chinese would prefer Africans to come in for two to three weeks, buy goods and go home. China is for Chinese.\"\n\nFor Dieng, living in Guangzhou, while his wife and three children reside in Senegal, is lonely.\n\n\"I think if after 12 years, you cannot make any real Chinese friends in China, it is a big problem.\"\n\nFeelings about foreigners\n\nIn 2013, China updated its legislation governing foreigners -- the Exit-Entry Administration Law -- for the first time since 1986.\n\nAfricans who had lived in Guangzhou for years, paid taxes there, fed Chinese-run factories and warehouses with business, and perhaps even married a Chinese national, hoped the reforms would offer them a path to genuine residency.\n\n\"It was very disappointing,\" says Castillo. \"Very vague, and very similar to the 1986 law. The message was: you're foreigners, it's not going to be easy.\" The only clear changes were harsher penalties for those who overstay visas and work illegally.\n\nPhotos: Little Africa in Guangzhou after \"beautification\" Little Africa after beautification \u2013 The main courtyard that was 2 years ago filled with markets and traders is now bare.

Many Africans report registering their visas in nearby Foshan, where the authorities they say are more lenient.\n\nDiallo has a permanent residence visa which, somewhat paradoxically, must be reapplied for every year.\n\n\"We work, we pay tax, have a 1-year permanent residence visa, but we have no resident's card,\" he says.\n\n\"At immigration, I come through the same line as a tourist.\"\n\nThe beautification of Little Africa\n\nLittle Africa in Guangzhou straddles a 7km stretch from the Nigerian annex of Guangyuan Xi Road, in Sanyuan Li, in the north of the city to Xiaobei, home to Dengfeng urban village: the heartbeat of this community.\n\nIn 2014, the government embarked on the \"beautification\" of Dengfeng, disrupting life for many residents.\n\nThis year-long upgrade tore down signage celebrating foreign trade, banned street markets that had been the area's lifeblood, widened and resurfaced roads and introduced a heavy police presence.\n\nEarlier this year the Southern Metropolis Daily reported, \"Dengfeng village, after a year-long beautification, has turned into an attractive spot for worldwide travelers. Dengfeng used to be a 'dirty, messy and bad' area in Guangzhou.\"\n\nAlthough the \"beautification\" fell in line with a wider policy of upgrading, or demolishing, urban villages in Guangzhou , the huge police presence thrust into this small strip is unprecedented in the rest of the city.\n\nA Foreign Affairs Service Center, manned by eight police at a time, looms at one entrance, multiple police stands are dotted throughout the 300-meter thoroughfare, while a \"Multifunction Service Center\" has opened in the heart of Dengfeng, also manned by police.\n\nThe Guangdong authorities did not reply to CNN's requests for comment on the \"beautification\" process.\n\nDiallo says police check Africans' passports from dawn 'til dusk, at their homes, hotel rooms and on the streets, a story corroborated by Matthews.\n\n\"Look around the world,\" says Mwamba,\"you will see Chinatowns, even in Africa. But here they don't want foreigners to be together here, to do things the way the Chinese do them overseas.\"\n\nSince the renovations, the majority of Africans have left this part of Little Africa, either moving to other areas of the city or out of China for good, leaving the once vibrant streets bare.\n\nTrouble at home\n\nIn the banks of Nigeria, Angola, Ethiopia and Mozambique, one essential thing has been lacking for some months.\n\nThe dollar.\n\nAs global oil prices plummet, bringing down that of other commodities with it, governments in these nations are restricting access to the greenback to safeguard dwindling reserves.\n\nFor Africans, who can't trade in their local currencies in Guangzhou, the consequences are stark.\n\nNigerian president Muhammadu Buhari has secured a currency swap deal with China.\n\nDiallo says: \"In Angola, if you go to the market the exchange rate for the dollar is over 500% higher than at the bank. But if you transfer money from China to the bank, it can take six months to withdraw your dollars.\"\n\nOjukwu lays it out simply. \"We use the dollar to buy things in China. But there are no dollars. It is a very big problem.\"\n\nTo offset the currency slump, Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari negotiated a currency swap deal with Xi Jingping in Beijing this year, which will allow Nigerians to send the yuan back to Nigerian banks.\n\nOjukwu and others are eagerly awaiting the deal to take effect.\n\nMwamba says: \"I have a shop in Angola, with my brother, selling car accessories that we buy in Guangzhou. No one in Angola now can afford to run their cars.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Mwamba reports that astute Chinese vendors are cutting out the middle man by traveling to African nations themselves, to sell the goods produced at their Guangdong factories, sometimes for half the price.\n\nTime to go?\n\nIn Mwamba's office, on the 17th floor of a rundown tower block, the twilight sun is exposing dust on a framed photograph behind his desk of the suited \"ambassador\" posing before the Guangzhou skyline.\n\nAfter 13 years in China, he is ready to go home. This is not a retreat -- more a decision to use his know-how where it's needed most.\n\n\"Everyone wants to go back to their own African country and start something,\" he says. \"We've learned here about small factories, trade.\n\n\"We should return home and apply that knowledge.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by CNN's Beijing intern Sean Zhong.",

    "text": "A McLennan County deputy stands guard near a group of bikers in the parking lot of a Twin Peaks restaurant Sunday, May 17, 2015, in Waco, Texas. Waco Police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton told KWTX-TV there were \"multiple victims\" after gunfire erupted between rival biker gangs at the restaurant. (Rod Aydelotte/Waco Tribune-Herald via AP)\n\nNine dead. Eighteen injured. Nearly 200 arrested.\n\nBut apparently, not much to see here.\n\nLooking at the media coverage of the May 17 mass murder among Texas motorcycle gangs, you would get the impression that it is not a big deal.\n\nRival gangs started shooting at each other, and at the police, outside the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco, Texas. Police described the scene as \u201cgruesome.\u201d\n\nIf the Texas biker gangs were black, the media would be on this thing like white on rice. Yet even though they were armed, because they were white, they were treated as human beings, with dignity.\n\nAs ThinkProgress reported, many of the gang members appear to be not only white but a number are white supremacists with Nazi SS tattoos and patches. Just for reference, under Hitler, the SS, or Schutzstaffel, served as the Nazis\u2019 elite paramilitary force and one of the most powerful units of the Third Reich. The SS ran the Nazi police state, the concentration camps and the death squads that went around Europe exterminating people on sight.\n\nAlthough it was a mass murder scene with armed gangs who were firing on police, these murder suspects and presumed participants in the bloodbath appear to be hanging out, chilling and holding tight, just getting some fresh air. And the cops didn\u2019t seem to be all too concerned.\n\nState and local police were there, to be sure, but where were the tanks, the teargas, the stun grenades, the Tasers and the other treatment usually reserved for peaceful black protestors? These white bikers were not hogtied and rounded up in paddy wagons. Most of all, no one is calling these white criminals thugs or gangbangers, as such language typically is reserved for young black men, including unarmed black men who are shot and killed by police. Rather, they are called \u201cmotorcycle clubs,\u201d which suggests a harmless, recreational purpose, as in getting together on the weekends to ride bikes together, maybe paying a membership fee, perhaps even getting involved in the community and donating to the charity of their choice.\n\nNevertheless, the FBI calls these gangs \u201cserious criminal enterprises.\u201d And this massacre is being called one of the worst gunfights in Waco\u2019s history. But you would not know that looking at the pictures coming from Waco.\n\nSo, where\u2019s the outcry from the media? Where is the 24-7 news coverage from Fox News and the drumbeat of condemnation of white criminality from conservative mouthpieces?\n\nThe fact is that the vast majority of mass shooters are white, and white criminals straight out of a massacre are treated with more respect than black victims such as Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown or Freddie Gray. For example, the media depicted James Holmes, the Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting suspect\u2014on trial for killing 12 and maiming 70\u2014as a brilliant science student, complete with suit and tie. And remember that Holmes, like so many other white mass murder suspects, manage to get out alive.\n\nMoreover, society has decided it will tolerate white gun violence, as the Second Amendment and all this \u201copen carry\u201d mess was really meant for whites to protect themselves from blacks, whether slave revolts back in the day or the black boogeyman today. And if a black men dares to exercise his right to open carry a weapon in public, he is arrested.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, policies that advocate for gun extremist backwardness and expansive gun rights are on the front burner, with a bill under consideration that would allow licensed gun owners the right to open carry in most public places, except for businesses whose regulations are against it. Cities were unable to opt out of the unfettered open carry legislation. It sounds outrageous, but remember, this is the state where Republicans are scared the big black man (that would be President Obama) is planning a military takeover.\n\nAnd no one really thinks the Waco gangland shootout will have any impact on Governor Greg Abbott (R-TX) signing the bill into law.\n\nYet, obviously there is a problem here, if Waco is any measure. But since the alleged perpetrators are not black, and they are not ISIS, we can say that boys will be (white) boys.\n\nFollow David A. Love on Twitter at @davidalove",

Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who has refused to endorse Trump, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday he would vote for Pence for president \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\n\"If I'm Donald Trump, I'm taking lessons now from how Pence performed and the rave reviews he got and I'm going to mirror that,\" Kinzinger said, in Trump's second bout with Clinton, Sunday night in St. Louis.\n\nA half-dozen Republican establishment leaders -- including current and former elected officials and high-level operatives who have publicly supported Trump -- heaped praise on Pence when CNN's Jamie Gangel asked for their take on his performance.\n\nSeveral sources sent the same response: \"Pence 2016!\"\n\n\"It was as if you suddenly remembered, 'Oh right, this is what it feels like when you have a candidate who knows how to debate, knows the issues and sounds like a Republican,'\" one said.\n\nAnother called Pence the most valuable player of the 2016 campaign.\n\nPence spent most of his time attacking the records of Clinton and President Barack Obama -- themes that he could revisit in a potential 2020 run if Clinton defeats Trump to win the White House.\n\nEven some conservatives were talking after the debate about Pence and 2020.\n\nErick Erickson, the blogger and anti-Trump movement leader, tweeted: \"Pence has convinced me conservatives should not write him off for 2020 just by being Trump's VP nominee. He was solid.\"\n\nPence has convinced me conservatives should not write him off for 2020 just by being Trump's VP nominee. He was solid. \u2014 Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) October 5, 2016\n\nBill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard who spent months recruiting an anti-Trump third party conservative candidate, tweeted congratulations to Pence for \"throwing (Trump) under the bus last night.\"\n\nI've been critical of @GovPenceIN as VP candidate, but I do want to congratulate him for throwing @realDonaldTrump under the bus last night. \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) October 5, 2016\n\nPence dismissed any notions he had overshadowed Trump in an interview with talk radio host Rush Limbaugh Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Donald Trump called me right after the debate to congratulate me and we actually talked a couple times last night,\" Pence said. \"I'm very encouraged that some people think I won, but really I'm just telling you ... from where I sat, Donald Trump won. He really did.\"\n\n\"It was Donald Trump's vision to make America great again. It was Donald Trump's vision to end illegal immigration once and for all,\" Pence said.\n\nTrump took credit for Pence's performance, too, at an event in Henderson, Nevada, on Wednesday.\n\n\"Mike Pence did an incredible job and I'm getting a lot of credit because this was my so-called first choice, that was my first hire as we would say,\" Trump said during a rally.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump said during a campaign stop at a Christian private school that he was \"very proud\" of Pence's performance.\n\n\"He won, he won on the issues, somebody said he won on style -- the style doesn't matter -- the issues, the policy matters. He's getting tremendous reviews from me and everybody,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's praise follows reports that Trump was upset about Pence repeatedly dodging opportunities to defend him during the debate.\n\n\"The media is saying Pence won, but didn't really defend Trump. That isn't sitting well with the boss,\" a senior Trump campaign aide told CNN's John King.\n\nClinton's campaign pushed the theme that Pence's performance was stylistically on-point but substantively disconnected from Trump's candidacy hard after the debate Tuesday and early Wednesday.\n\n\"The vice president's job is to go in and defend the top of the ticket. Mike Pence looked more like he was looking at 2020 than 2016,\" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nPodesta pointed to Pence adopting different positions than Trump on Russia and saying the US military should be prepared to strike the Syrian government.\n\n\"He didn't sound at all like what Donald Trump has been saying on the campaign trail. He made a whole new policy up on Syria which embraced Hillary Clinton's approach to what's been going on in Syria,\" Podesta said.\n\nKaren Finney, a Kaine aide, made a similar case to CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day.\"\n\n\"I think the question was always going to be, how far would Mike Pence go to defend Donald Trump, or would he be more concerned about his own 2020 aspirations?\" Finney said. \"And I think the answer to that is pretty clear after last night. He literally -- he scoffed and he laughed and he tried to shake his head. But he did not defend Donald Trump.\"",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.\n\n(CNN) Among the results of the recent deadly police shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, is the additional jolt of grim reality enhancing the rap artist T.I.'s video of his \"War Zone,\" which depicts scenes of excessive, at times deadly police force used against unarmed citizens and other incidents of harassment. The blunt, brutal twist is that racial roles are reversed to show the police as black and the victims as white.\n\nIt's a provocative approach that has people talking. Which is good: We have a lot to talk about in this country when it comes to race. Maybe that's why so many of us try to avoid what we continue to euphemize as \"our ongoing national dialogue.\" And when we can't avoid it, we try to keep it contained within boundaries familiar and safe -- in other words, terms we can live with, guaranteeing that what we believe -- whether \"we\" are black or white -- will always be validated.\n\nGuess what? That gets us exactly nowhere.\n\nAs long as this \"dialogue\" spins around in a cul-de-sac of accepted wisdom, recycled bromides and, worse, unyielding biases, the conversation, which everybody from the President on down insists is crucial to our survival as a democracy, will forever chase its own tail. The Black Lives Matter movement and what protesters believe to be a lack of legal and moral accountability in excessive police force against unarmed black citizens seem at this writing to have placed Americans of all ethnic, religious and racial persuasions in locked positions, where some refuse to look away and others can't do anything but.\n\nJUST WATCHED Justice Department investigating Tulsa cop shooting Replay More Videos ...

    "text": "Future of Aviation explores the next leaps forward in the world of air travel, from jet technology to passenger experiences. Read CNN's sponsorship policy\n\nContrast that with today's cramped seats and overcrowded airports and it looks like our flying experiences are getting steadily worse.\n\nBut is this based on reality?\n\nThe aviation industry has been investing massively to prove nostalgic travelers wrong.\n\nYes, aircraft may still look similar to those of the so-called golden years.\n\nBut every single aspect of the air travel experience is currently being overhauled -- all driven by technology.\n\nRight at the forefront are airplane cabins.\n\nAnd key to their transformation is wireless connectivity.\n\nWith virtually every passenger toting a smartphone, tablet or laptop, inflight Wi-Fi is opening up new ways to engage with air travelers and redefine the flying experience.\n\nPersonalized inflight entertainment\n\nPanasonic's Waterfront system allows passengers to use their mobile devices to control an aircraft's built-in entertainment.\n\nMobile tech already plays an important role in enhancing travel, from electronic boarding passes to last-minute bids on biz class upgrades.\n\nSome airlines, such as KLM, have even started sending boarding passes and flight alerts through a dedicated airline Facebook Messenger chat bot\n\nBut the one area where mobile can become truly transformative is inflight entertainment, with personal devices becoming gateways to a whole range of up-in-the-air services.\n\nWhile built-in in-flight entertainment systems are unlikely to vanish, particularly on long-haul flights, they can work in tandem with the passenger's own devices.\n\nPhotos: Vintage airline photos Photos: Vintage airline photos Never an awkward moment \u2013 Before inflight movies and Wi-Fi, passengers passed the time by reading books or newspapers. Or by caressing their necklaces and gazing off into the middle distance. Hide Caption 1 of 13 Photos: Vintage airline photos Card games \u2013 Airlines often provided playing cards to help pass the time. There's clearly something other than cards going on here though. Why else would a young Dick Nixon be taking notes in the corner? Hide Caption 2 of 13 Photos: Vintage airline photos Chess \u2013 And then there was chess. We're not fooled by this guy's bow tie -- even the cabin crew is two moves ahead of him. Hide Caption 3 of 13 Photos: Vintage airline photos Checkers \u2013 Back then, it seems, everyone loved children on flights. Maybe when the only alternative was chess and cards, people genuinely enjoyed being around their offspring. Maybe the drinks trolley hadn't been by yet.

If this flight hit turbulence, the bottles would've gotten just as smashed as the passengers.

Let's hope he didn't take as long to choose his food as he did to make a chess move. Hide Caption 6 of 13 Photos: Vintage airline photos Pilot power \u2013 The plane's captain, often a rugged veteran of the skies, sometimes made the rounds.

Hide Caption 13 of 13\n\nEarlier in 2016, Panasonic unveiled Waterfront, a system that allows the passengers to use their mobile handsets to control an aircraft's built-in entertainment.\n\nAerospace companies Thales and B/E are also using mobiles to personalize passenger experiences.\n\nBy syncing with handsets, their seats know a passenger's preferences and can even restart a movie at the exact place where they left it in the previous flight.\n\nSome airlines are doing away with embedded entertainment systems altogether.\n\nThey're opting for passenger's handsets to deliver inflight entertainment -- a move that crucially reduces aircraft weight and frees up cabin space.\n\nNo Internet connection is required, passengers just connect their devices to an in-plane network.\n\nCaptive audience\n\nThales and B/E's Digital Sky seats make use of larger, higher-res screens.\n\nNetherlands-based AirFi is primarily equipping low-cost airlines that often fly short-haul single-aisle aircraft and don't have entertainment systems.\n\nThe company's portable wireless system beams pre-loaded content onto passenger devices.\n\nThe AirFi terminal behaves like a normal Internet router. It's lightweight and can easily be installed in a luggage compartment.\n\nAirFi CEO Job Heimerikx says it's a cost effective and flexible way to provide quality inflight content to the short haul market.\n\n\"There are a customer service and a commercial angle to our system,\" he says.\n\n\"Passengers can access a broad range of movies and other sort of entertainment, but they can also use it to order food or shop duty free.\n\n\"It's like an evolution of the traditional inflight magazine, but just as it happens at online stores, you can make it really personal.\"\n\nThis concept thrives on having a captive audience.\n\nBut would it still work if users had a full inflight broadband Internet connection?\n\nPassengers might be more interested in binge-watching their favorite TV series instead of booking airport transfers or ordering an extra cup of coffee.\n\nVirtual reality\n\nAirFi offers a cheap alternative to inflight entertainment systems, streaming direct to phones and tablets.\n\n\"If airlines can't stop the passenger from going to Amazon or zoning out on Netflix for three hours... and they can't offer something at least equally interesting in terms of intuitive retail and custom content, they are missing a number of tricks\" says Maryann Simson of Runway Girl Network , a leading aviation news website focusing on passenger experience.\n\nIt's a theory that'll get put to the test soon.\n\nAeromexico recently announced it would use Gogo's 2Ku satellite-based Internet connection to offer Netflix-enabled flights.\n\n\"More than 80% of passengers are walking on the plane with their own device,\" Gogo exec Ash ElDifrawi points out.\n\n\"Airlines can save the weight and maintenance costs of legacy seat-back entertainment systems and still provide differentiated experiences.\n\n\"For example, they can now create custom portals that create a unique brand and advertising opportunity for the airlines.\"\n\nInternet connections are only the beginning.\n\nBoth Transavia, a low cost subsidiary of Air France/KLM, and Australian carrier Qantas have been testing virtual reality technology as an alternative to traditional in flight entertainment.\n\nVR could offer not only entertainment but also help calm those afraid of flying.\n\nTransavia also sees virtual reality sets as a potential source of extra cash, perhaps offered as a premium service.\n\nDaan Noordeloos, manager marketing and customer strategies for Transavia, says tests have so far proved positive.\n\n\"We are evaluating ways to continue it and make it part of our regular inflight offering,\" he adds.\n\nPerfect airline seat\n\nVirtual reality is already a reality after trials by Qantas.\n\nQantas has already rolled out VR sets for first class passengers on some select flights between Australia and Los Angeles, with encouraging results.\n\nNew generation in-flight entertainment isn't going to be enjoyable without a comfortable environment to experience it in.\n\nProviding a nice, relaxing atmosphere in a cramped metal tube is always going to be a challenge, but moves are afoot to improve that.\n\nLED lighting has already proven effective during night flights, even apparently reducing jet lag.\n\nNo wonder both Boeing's next generation aircraft and the \"Airspace by Airbus\" cabin, rolled out on Airbus A330neo and A350 aircraft, make extensive use of LEDs.\n\nExtra comfort is also coming from the constant accumulation of incremental ergonomic improvements.\n\nThese are the things that passengers barely notice on their own but put together make a difference between a good and a great travel experience.\n\nSuch as lavatories with anti-bacterial surfaces, or better designed overhead bins that reduce boarding time by making it easier to store hand luggage.\n\nMany of the industry's creative energies are being devoted to creating the perfect airline seat.\n\nIt may come as a surprise to those stuck at the back of the economy class cabin, but these are exciting times for the aircraft seating industry.\n\nAn increasing number of airlines are discontinuing first class, but those that keep it are making it way more opulent, such as Etihad with its Residence\n\nDiscontinuing first has led many airlines to upgrade their business class, opening a gap for the introduction of premium economy services.\n\nCinema-style seating\n\nFactory Design's twisting seat adapts to the body of its occupant.\n\nSome carriers are pondering a more basic economy class, but does that mean radical proposals for standing-only planes will soon be realized?\n\nExperts at passenger comfort innovators Zodiac Aerospace don't think so.\n\nThey say certification costs and reputation risks may simply not be worth it, particularly when existing seats with pitches of 30 inches or less are already very efficient.\n\n\"I really can't foresee this happening in the near future,\" says Victor Carlioz, an advanced concept engineer at Zodiac Aerospace.\n\n\"Instead we'll see a focus toward more innovative features in the economy class seat.\n\nA compromise may be the flex-up seat proposed by Aviointeriors.\n\nThe Italian manufacturer is exploring a cinema-style seat for economy class that folds up vertically when unoccupied, allowing easier movement around the plane.\n\nIngo Wuggetzer, of Airbus, highlights how personalization is also becoming a thing in aircraft interiors.\n\nThe industry ideal is to create a seat that adapts perfectly to a passenger's body.\n\nIn 2011 the European manufacturer unveiled its \"Future by Airbus\" concept that outlined, among other things, the company's vision of the passenger cabin of 2050.\n\nThis included its own interpretation of the \"smart seat\" -- one able to recognize and adapt to its occupant ergonomically and through entertainment preferences.\n\nA first step in that direction may be the \"twisting seat\" concept proposed by London-based Factory Design\n\nCreative director Adam White says the flexible structure is based upon a careful anatomical study of the multiple positions that the back adopts while seated.\n\nSleeping rooms\n\nFactory Design's Air Lair concept offers passengers their own personalized cocoon.\n\nWhite is also behind Air Lair, a concept of sleeping pods that immerse premium travelers in a futuristic cocoon with adjustable light, sound and temperature.\n\nOther designs envisage adding sleeping rooms in standard aircraft cabins.\n\nCarlioz and his Zodiac Aerospace team, for example, see potential in using an aircraft's cargo space and area between the stowage bins and fuselage to accommodate bunks.\n\n\"It's simply a question of who has the ambition and willingness to invest into a project of this scale and truly break the mold,\" says the company's industrial designer, Matthew Cleary.\n\nSounds radical, but perhaps not so much once the likely evolution of current technologies and concepts are taken into account.\n\n\"Design houses really are competing fiercely for airline business and that means they are also pushing the limits of creativity,\" says Runway Girl Network's Simson.\n\n\"Designs are becoming more intuitive, fabrics more breathable and inner-foam materials are being developed to stay cooler (which adds to comfort).\n\n\"Increasingly, we see seat designers taking cues from the automotive industry too, with auto seat makers such as Recaro and Mirus having started successful aero divisions.\"\n\nAirbus's Wuggetzer says there's potential to develop powerful strategies to produce standout cabin features, even in economy class.\n\nTransparency is key, he adds.\n\n\"The same way that travelers are used to comparing hotels and check reviews on TripAdvisor, innovation in the cabin experience could lead to more differentiation between the experience provided not just on different aircraft types, but on different airlines.\"\n\nThe golden age of air travel may be just starting, after all...",

And the speculation on what went wrong has inevitably been closely followed by the related question of who is to blame?\n\nPeggy Drexler\n\nThe trouble with that question, though, is that it completely overlooks the reality of most marriages.\n\nRumors of the Hollywood couple's impending split had actually been circulating for months, with tabloids fueling the speculation by peddling sensationalized or unsubstantiated rumors such as Hollywood Life reporting as early as March that the pair had been fighting due to issues over Jolie's alleged \"insane jealousy.\" In May, Radar Online ran a headline that Pitt was \"caught kissing\" actress Lizzy Caplan on the set of their latest film, Allied.\n\nAnd that is, so far, all we officially know. Naturally, though, the media has made numerous attempts to fill in the blanks, speculating that causes for the split could include substance abuse, anger issues, bad parenting, and, naturally, other women.\n\nAt the heart of all of such reports -- which are frequently built on foundations no more solid than mysterious friends or sources \"close to\" the couple -- are a few familiar questions: What went wrong? What's to blame? And, of course, who is most to blame?",

    "text": "Atlanta (CNN) The first pitch was thrown by Atlanta Braves starter Julio Teheran to Detroit Tigers leadoff hitter Ian Kinsler at 3:13 p.m ET, with the game-time temperature at 80 degrees.\n\nAnd with that, it was the start of the final goodbye to Major League Baseball in downtown Atlanta.\n\nOn Sunday, the final day of the MLB regular season, the Braves and fans bid farewell to Turner Field, the team's home since 1997, with a 1-0 win against the Tigers.\n\n\"There's a sentimental significance behind it,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"This place holds a lot of really good memories for a lot of people, and it's great to go out like that.\"\n\nTeheran pitched one of his finest games, going seven innings and giving up three hits, one walk and no runs. He struck out 12, tying his career high. Freddie Freeman drove in Ender Inciarte on a first-inning sacrifice fly.\n\n\"Being the last game ever at Turner Field, it's kind of an emotional thing,\" Freeman said. \"I've spent seven seasons here, my big league debut and everything. I'm always going to remember this place. It has a lot of special moments and memories for me. I'm just happy we won the last game.\"\n\nThe stadium is named after CNN founder Ted Turner, who owned the Braves from 1976-1996.\n\nThe Braves never won a World Series at the stadium nicknamed \"The Ted.\" The lone title for the franchise in Atlanta was won next door at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in 1995. That stadium was imploded on August 2, 1997, and is now a parking lot.\n\nIn 2013, the Braves announced they were leaving Turner Field for a new stadium to be built in Cobb County, northwest of the city. At the time, Club President John Schuerholz said that Turner Field needed \"hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades. Unfortunately, that massive investment would not do anything to improve access or the fan experience.\"\n\n#Braves Alumni talk about their favorite memories at The Ted. #TurnerFieldFarewell pic.twitter.com/cAzBgsfK83 \u2014 Atlanta Braves (@Braves) October 2, 2016\n\nAround the same time, city money was allocated for another stadium in downtown Atlanta , for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.

    "text": "(CNN) Marwa al-Sabouni lives on a noisy street near the old part of Homs, one of Syria's most decimated cities. Cars honk outside her door, but destruction is only one street away. Every horizon shows rubble from buildings shattered by the Assad regime's deadly bombing.\n\nSyria's third largest city, Homs became known as the \"capital of the revolution\" when thousands of its residents rose up to protest against government oppression in 2011. The city became a rebel stronghold and paid a high price: its old mosques and churches, souks and squares now lie in ruins.\n\nAs an architect, Sabouni's vision of Homs as a battleground started long before the war. Her new book, \"The Battle for Home: The Vision of a Young Architect in Syria,\" is an extraordinary telling of how the city's structure led, in part, to its downfall, and how architecture can heal the deep rifts in the country's social and urban fabric.\n\nThe official plans for the rebuilding of the district of Baba Amr in the southwest of Homs\n\nThe official plans for the rebuilding of the district of Baba Amr in the southwest of Homs\n\nCross-section of a Tree unit.

Her illustrations Syria's buildings and public spaces. Seen here: The carnage of the New Clock demonstration\n\nHow urban planning fueled a fire\n\nSabouni feels the way the city was developed and planned contributed to sectarian tensions that helped fuel the fire behind the revolution. Urban ghettos segregated according to religion or origin, and a lack of public places where people could mingle and work together left the city bereft of a sense of cohesion, and its inhabitants starved of a collective identity.\n\n\"This vandalism that happened to the built environment made people not care about each other, and become very alien from each other and from the place,\" Sabouni says over Skype from Homs.\n\nThe book weaves her personal journey as a young architect and mother with the story of Homs' past, present and future -- the ancient city of mummies and dark tunnels that lie beneath the surface; the corruption and cronyism that lead to the destruction of public spaces and the neglect of old buildings; and the need for a new type of inclusive architecture in order to avoid the mistakes of the past.\n\n\"(Old places like souks) had a major role in bringing people together to interact with each other,\" she says. \"We need to emphasize this to bring life again to the cities... Not building slums and social housing and trying to solve a problem by creating another problem, by creating isolated blocks, more concrete.\"\n\nLife in a war zone\n\nEveryday life poses challenges, from the mundane to the life-threatening.\n\nAt the height of the conflict, bullets flew through Sabouni's kitchen window, and she and her family slept and woke to the sounds of bombing and buildings shaking.\n\nFor two years, she did not see the moon. Since government forces took control of most of the city in 2014, the real difficulty has been wrestling with the basics like food, heat and light. For those stuck in the limbo of war, everyday domestic battles for survival become the fabric of existence once the bombs have stopped falling.\n\nJUST WATCHED Palmyra's Arch of Triumph printed in 3D Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Palmyra's Arch of Triumph printed in 3D 02:18\n\nSabouni's passion for the built environment is clear, and yet the realities of living in a war zone provide a grim sense of perspective.\n\n\"When you hear about people dying in the street, just dropping down like birds, or open your window and see kids who have died just a moment ago from a mortar, you don't worry very much about the death of a building,\" she says.\n\nAnd yet in times of war, architecture can take on a deeper meaning, as summed up by one of the passages in her book:\n\n\"Our homes do not just contain our life earnings, they contain our memories and dreams, they stand for what we are. To destroy one's home should be taken as an equal crime to destroying one's soul.\"\n\nIt is this sense of the preciousness of home that Sabouni says underlines her vision for rebuilding Syria, \"recapturing the values that used to be represented in areas that were successful in binding people and making them feel at home.\"\n\n\"The architecture that we all should strive for is the architecture that builds a home.\"",

The company, famous for making cellphones with physical keyboards that were once so popular people nicknamed them Crackberries, has decided to stop making its own devices.\n\nBlackBerry said on Wednesday that it will rely on partners to manufacture the phones, which will still have BlackBerry's look and feel.\n\nThe company announced a joint venture with an Indonesian telecom company that will start making them. BlackBerry plans to turn its attention to software, a move it has made gradually in recent years as sales of its phones have slid.\n\nShares of BlackBerry (BBRY, Tech30) rose 4% in early trading after the announcement. But the stock price is well below its peak from several years ago.\n\nBlackBerry was once the phone of choice for Wall Street traders, politicians and celebrities, thanks in part to its well-regarded security system. President Obama was spotted with a BlackBerry. So was Kim Kardashian West.\n\nRelated: Kim Kardashian's last BlackBerry Bold has finally died\n\nBut the company was too late to the touchscreen game, and customers left in droves for Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) iPhone, Samsung's (SSNLF) Galaxy and other devices running on Google's (GOOGL, Tech30) Android system.\n\nEven Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) has moved ahead of BlackBerry with its Windows Phones.\n\nCEO John Chen has tried to turn the company around since joining in 2013. But even as he has pushed BlackBerry toward mobile and security software, apps and the plethora of connected devices known as the Internet of Things, BlackBerry has bled red ink, posted sharp sales declines and lost customers.\n\nChen has even done what was once unthinkable, opening the BlackBerry to other operating systems. The company now sells phones that run on Android. It also killed off its BlackBerry Classic line of phones this summer.\n\nSo Chen deserves credit for stabilizing BlackBerry and refocusing it on higher growth areas.\n\nThe company is also no longer in danger of going under, a legitimate concern investors had before he took control. BlackBerry now has about $2.5 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet -- money for a proverbial rainy day.\n\nBlackBerry will need all the cash it can get. The company also reported Wednesday that its latest quarterly sales fell about 30% from a year ago.\n\nAnd BlackBerry said that it expects to break even this fiscal year at best. That's still better than the loss analysts had forecast.\n\nBut if Chen can't get the company's sales growing again and return it to profitability, there could be more pressure on him to sell BlackBerry.\n\nThat's exactly what Chen has done in the past. He sold the struggling software company Sybase to SAP (SAP, Tech30) for a hefty premium while he was CEO of Sybase.\n\nThere has been chatter about a BlackBerry sale for years.\n\nThe rumor mill may start turning again, though. BlackBerry also announced Wednesday that CFO James Yersh was stepping down and that he would be replaced by Steven Capelli, who worked with Chen at Sybase.\n\nChen and Capelli also worked together at Pyramid Technology in the mid-1900s, a company that was sold to Siemens under their watch.\n\nSo BlackBerry investors might be hoping that lightning will strike three times and Chen and Capelli can pull off another sale.",

Trump joins anchor, Jake Tapper to discuss repercussions of the recent DNC e-mail leak, Roger Ailes stepping down, the possibility of running for Mayor of New York and more.\n\nMANDATORY CREDIT: CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\n\nTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\n\nDonald Trump Jr. on how Mook responded to DNC email leak: [TAPPER] So, I don't know if you were hearing earlier, but Robby Mook, the campaign manager for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I asked him about the DNC leak.And he suggested that experts are saying that Russians were behind both the leak - the hacking of the DNC e-mails and their release. He seemed to be suggesting that this is part of a plot to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. Your response?[TRUMP JR] Well, it just goes to show you their exact moral compass. I mean, they will say anything to be able to win this. I mean, this is time and time again, lie after lie. You notice he won't say, well, I say this. We hear experts. You know, here\u2019s (INAUDIBLE) at home once said that this is what's happening with the Russians. It's disgusting. It's so phony. I watched him bumble through the interview, I was able to hear it on audio a little bit. I mean, I can't think of bigger lies, but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win.You hear it with the DNC where they're leaking emails about Bernie Sanders and his Jewish heritage, to be able to try to destroy him in the south. It's a rigged system. It's disgusting and the people who should be fed up because when I heard it I certainly was.[TAPPER] President Obama \u2013There\u2019s nothing wrong with a fair fight, Jake. I don't mind a fair fight, but these lies and the perpetuating of that kind of nonsense to try, you know, gain some political capital is just outrageous and he should be ashamed of himself. If a Republican did that\u2026[TAPPER] President Obama \u2013[TRUMP JR]: \u2026 they would be calling for people to bring out the electric chair.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. on the possibility of Roger Ailes joining the campaign: [TAPPER] Your father raised the prospect of bringing on Roger Ailes the former chairman and CEO of FOX News and the idea being Mr. Trump said something along the lines of people are talking about maybe he would run my campaign. Is that actually in play, roger Ailes coming on board and running the campaign? [TRUMP JR.] Not that I\u2019m aware of. I mean, I know they are friends and have a long-term relationship but I\u2019m happy with the work that Paul Manafort is doing, I think our team is really coming into place and swing, it's been exciting to be a fly on the wall watching a lot of this stuff go down. Because - you know, again, we're trying to give a voice to the people who have been forgotten and I think the campaign is doing a wonderful job of that.\n\nFULL POST",

    "text": "Arun Vishwanath is an associate professor in the Department of Communication at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The views expressed are his own.\n\n(CNN) It's not surprising that some Yahoo users have decided to sue the company for negligence over a 2014 breach that was only recently discovered and announced . But before we blame Yahoo for this, we need to understand how hackers accomplish such breaches -- and what all of us should be doing better to prevent such breaches.\n\nThe reality is that all of us -- individuals, businesses and policy makers -- have a role to play in keeping us safe, whether it be engaging in better cyber safety, or passing regulations that ensure the public is notified of breaches so we can respond in a timely fashion.\n\nHackers wage a sort of asymmetric warfare. Instead of trying to circumvent sophisticated organizational firewalls, most go after soft targets -- the employees and customers of the organization. Many use simple spear phishing attacks with hyperlinks that launch spoofed web pages that directly solicit user logins or hide malware in email attachments that provide backdoor access into the organization's networks. Such attacks are enormously successful, securing victimization rates of close to 30% in some cases -- a sobering statistic when one considers that the hacker needs just one victim. Other attacks, such as the hack into the U.K.'s ISP TalkTalk -- exploit weaknesses in web forms and access the databases that run behind web pages. Such access is even easier when the hacker has procured the website administrator's login through spear phishing.\n\nMaking all this worse is that hackers using stolen credentials are hard to detect because they appear similar to an employee making legitimate requests. Many lurk in computer network for months, move laterally looking for weaknesses and slowly exfiltrate data to avoid detection. This is likely why it took Yahoo almost two years to discover the breach. And they are not alone. Unfortunately, it takes on average 200 or more days to discover a breach. And although companies are spending more on technological firewalls and employee training, most breaches continue to only be discovered accidentally, when an employee chances on something amiss or, as in the Yahoo case, when the hacker puts the data up for sale.\n\nThis gap also makes remediation challenging because knowledge of the breach comes long after the information has been used to victimize users. Meanwhile, organizations are reluctant to admit to breaches because of the negative media attention they receive.\n\nAnd here's where Yahoo could have done more: there is speculation they may have learned of the breach in early August. If we hope to stop this, we must begin by realizing that no single company or technological \"silver-bullet\" can stop a breach. Instead, all of us must work together.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice?\n\nFirst, organizations who are the targets of attacks must take the lead by adopting best practices that make it harder for a hacker to enter and move within networks. This need not mean complex, expensive fixes, but simple strategies like the ones outlined by the NSA in its recently published Methodology for Adversary Obstruction . These include policies such as ensuring that administrator accounts do not have Internet access so that sensitive credentials cannot be stolen through spear phishing; using different passwords for users and administrators so hackers cannot move across the network; enforcing multi-factor authentication, which means an additional PIN is sent to another device that needs to be entered and \"salting\" (adding random data) and encrypting all stored credentials so that passwords are uncrackable even when stolen.\n\nBut it is not just up to organizations -- every one of us needs to do our bit. This must start with checking if our credentials have been compromised on sites like \" Have I been Pwned ,\" which log stolen credentials, and changing those logins right away. Each of us must work on developing better cyber safety: learning to deal with spear phishing emails; enabling multi-factor authentication where available; using strong, unique passwords and using password-storage vaults; and learning to actively monitor our own devices for suspicious activity so that compromises cannot make their way from our devices to our organization's.\n\nFinally, policy makers must focus on improving the breach remediation processes. While most states have passed breach notification laws , policies on breach remediation remain open-ended. Simply notifying people or asking victims to change their passwords, as Yahoo just did, or providing people credit protection as Target and others did , does little to contain the damage to one's reputation stemming from an information leak. Imagine the stigma if the health records of the 80 million victims of the Anthem breach were ever released. Once released, this information becomes available on searchable databases, victimizing people forever. Here, the EU has been more proactive and ruled in favor of a right to be forgotten online , making it possible for EU citizens to prohibit their personal information from appearing on online searches. Perhaps it's time we considered this, too.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAt the end of day, hackers are not after LinkedIn or Yahoo's data -- they are after ours. That means it is our collective responsibility to help protect that data.",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) Donald Trump is facing another political mess -- this time just five weeks from Election Day.\n\nThe Times did not look at his federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax return as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns.\n\nCNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by The Times.\n\nMounting questions about Trump's businesses and finances are set to test Republicans' loyalty to the party's nominee. And they will test Trump's temperament as well, the week before his second debate with Hillary Clinton.\n\nHere are six questions about Trump's taxes and the political fallout:\n\nDid Trump pay income taxes?\n\nWe still don't know.\n\nThe bottom line: Unless and until he releases his personal income tax returns, as every other presidential nominee since 1976 has, there's no way to verify what Trump has or hasn't paid.\n\nHowever, Trump's $916 million loss in 1995 -- around the time his Atlantic City casinos were going bust -- could be spread out over a total of 18 years to offset the taxable profits he earned from other businesses.\n\nIt's possible Trump lost money other years, as well, which could be used similarly. And he has a slew of tax breaks available to real estate developers\n\nTrump's steadfast refusal to release his tax returns -- the last 12 years' worth are under \"routine audit,\" he's said repeatedly -- make it impossible to know what he's paid.\n\nWhat's the immediate political damage?\n\nTrump has just five weeks left to Election Day -- and the next several days are all but certain to be dominated by questions about whether he pays taxes.\n\nAny hope Trump had of dodging and deflecting on the issue through November 8 is now gone.\n\nEven more troubling: He just spent a week feuding with a former Latina Miss Universe who he had publicly ridiculed as \"Miss Piggy\" and \"Miss Housekeeping\" 20 years ago -- and who he continued insisting was overweight last week, rather than dropping the issue.\n\nAt this stage in the tightly contested race, Trump's momentum has stalled and time is an increasingly precious resource. Unless he is suddenly willing to share much more information about his taxes, he'll have squandered two important weeks as early voting is underway in several key states.\n\nIs 'genius' very smart?\n\nThe messaging out of Trump Tower has been clear: If Trump didn't pay federal income taxes, it makes him a \"genius.\"\n\nIt was the buzzword coming from Trump's top surrogates on the Sunday shows.\n\n\"The reality is, this is part of our tax code. The man's a genius. He knows how to operate the tax code to the benefit of the people he's serving,\" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"There's no one who's shown more genius in their way to maneuver around the tax code and to rightfully use the laws to do that,\" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nBut labeling Trump a \"genius\" when so many questions remain unanswered is politically problematic because it implies that Trump in fact did not pay taxes. And if he's a genius for not paying income taxes, what does that make everybody who does?\n\nWill this hurt Trump in the Rust Belt?\n\nThe case for Trump has long been that hard-working Americans -- particularly in the Rust Belt -- have been unfairly hammered by outside forces like immigration and globalization.\n\nBy refusing to directly address the questions raised by The New York Times report, Trump's campaign so far has left open the possibility that those workers for years have paid more in federal income taxes than Trump, despite his vast wealth.\n\nIf the revelations on Trump's taxes leave Trump looking like a beneficiary of the status quo in Washington, it could become harder for him to sell himself as an outsider in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, where he desperately needs wins.\n\nThere is evidence that a majority of voters believe it is important that presidential candidates release their tax records.\n\nIn a Monmouth University poll last month, 62% of those asked thought it was very important or somewhat important for candidates to show their tax records.\n\nWill Trump face more pressure to release his tax returns?\n\nYes -- particularly now that new questions have been raised.\n\nThat pressure could be amplified by members of Trump's own party. Congressional Republicans will be asked a new round of questions about Trump's taxes, and some could call on him to release his returns.\n\nIt's also sure to be a hot topic in the vice presidential debate, pitting Trump's running mate Mike Pence against Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine on Tuesday night.\n\nAdd this to the list of questions Trump has left unanswered: Has he paid income taxes? Why did he suddenly decide President Barack Obama was born in the United States? What keeps him from dropping distracting personal feuds with people like Alicia Machado and Rosie O'Donnell?\n\nIn each public appearance and interview this week, Trump will be asked questions related to his taxes. He will likely answer by bashing the media and pivoting to attacks on Clinton -- which will only perpetuate the questions.\n\nWill Trump react by attacking Clinton?\n\nOver the course of the 2016 campaign, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he reacts to personal slights by lashing out angrily -- often with attacks on individuals that come at a political cost, such as his criticism of Indiana-born Judge Gonzalo Curiel's Mexican heritage and the Gold Star Khan family.\n\nThe tax revelations won't just create new pressure for Trump to release his returns, they'll raise questions about the credibility of Trump's claims he has created a \"great company.\"\n\nTrump offered a glimpse of the bare-knuckled style he's returning to Saturday night in Pennsylvania, as news of his $916 million loss in 1995 broke.\n\nHe said Clinton \"could be crazy\" and lacks the \"stamina\" to be president -- even imitating Clinton stumbling into her car while leaving a 9/11 ceremony last month. And he questioned, with no evidence, whether the Democratic nominee is \"loyal\" to her husband.\n\n\"I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really folks, really, why should she be?\" Trump said Saturday, apparently calling into question Clinton's marital fidelity to her husband -- without evidence -- in his most direct terms yet.\n\nHe willl campaign in northern Virginia and Colorado on Monday, followed by Arizona on Tuesday, in what will be the first tests of his temperament and handling of tax return questions.",

    "text": "Kevin Carey directs the education policy program at New America. This article is adapted from \" The End of College: Creating the Future of Learning and the University of Everywhere ,\" published by Riverhead Books on March 3. This is the latest in a series, \"Big Ideas for a New America,\" in which the think tank New America spotlights experts' solutions to the nation's greatest challenges. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) In 1796, in his final annual address to Congress, President George Washington called for the creation of:\n\n\"...a National University; and also a Military Academy. The desirableness of both these Institutions, has so constantly increased with every new view I have taken of the subject, that I cannot omit the opportunity of once for all, recalling your attention to them.\"\n\nThe Military Academy was soon built at West Point. But despite leaving $22,222 for its establishment (a lot of money back then) in his last will and testament, Washington's National University never came to pass.\n\nInstead, lawmakers chose to rely on state governments and religious denominations to build and finance new colleges and universities.\n\nToday, the American higher education system is in crisis. The price of college has grown astronomically, forcing students and parents to take out loans that now exceed $1.2 trillion in outstanding debt. Many of those loans are falling into default as graduates struggle to find work. The latest research suggests that our vaunted universities are producing graduates who haven't learned very much.\n\nThe time has come to revive George Washington's great idea, in 21st century form. Advances in information technology that would have seemed like pure magic in colonial times mean we can now create a 21st Century National University that will help millions of students get a high-quality, low-cost college education \u2014 without hiring any professors, building any buildings or costing the taxpayers a dime.\n\nWashington's role\n\nTo see how, it helps to understand the three ways the federal government currently supports higher education.\n\nTwo of them are well known. First, the Defense Department, National Institutes of Health, and other federal agencies spend hundreds of billions of dollars financing university-based research, contributing to countless scientific breakthroughs and commercial innovations. Second, the U.S. Department of Education provides $150 billion annually in grants and loans to help students pay for college.\n\nAs tuitions rise and states continue to slash funding for public universities (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recently proposed $300 million in new cuts), the federal government has become the college financier of last resort.\n\nBut there is a third essential federal role in higher education that is far less well known. In many ways, it's the most important of them all, and the key to creating a 21st Century National University. In addition to funding colleges, the federal government approves colleges.\n\nIt does this through a little-understood process called accreditation. To be eligible for those billions of research and financial aid dollars, colleges must be accredited. Technically, accreditors are nonprofit organizations run by consortia of existing colleges. But in order to make a college eligible for federal money, accreditors must first be approved by the federal government. Without that approval and the money that goes along with it, both colleges and accreditors would immediately close up shop. In other words, Uncle Sam ultimately decides who gets to be an American college and grant college degrees.\n\nA university with no buildings\n\nSo, here's the big idea: In order to build a 21st Century National University, all the federal government has to do is something very simple: Approve itself.\n\nIn George Washington's days, this would have been only the first step of a process subsequently involving the construction of an actual university. Doing this today would accomplish little in solving the higher education crisis, because physical universities cost billions of dollars to construct from scratch and can still only enroll a handful of the many students who can't afford a good education.\n\nFortunately, there's no need for new buildings \u2014 or, for that matter, administrators, libraries, faculty, and all the rest. Existing colleges and universities, flush with federal dollars, have already created all the essential building blocks for National U. Anyone with an Internet connection can log on to Coursera, edX, saylor.org, and many other websites offering high-quality online courses, created by many of the world's greatest universities and taught by tenured professors, for free.\n\nTens of millions of students have already signed up for these courses over the last four years. Yet enrollment in traditional colleges hasn't flagged, and prices have continued to rise. The reason is clear. The free college providers can't (or won't) give online students the one thing they need more than anything else: a college degree. Elite universities like Harvard and Stanford don't want to dilute their exclusive brands. Nonelite universities don't want to give away something they're currently selling for a lot of money.\n\nThat's where the federal government comes in. With some authorizing language from Congress and a small, one-time start-up budget, the U.S. Department of Education could create a nonprofit, bipartisan organization with only two missions: approving courses and granting degrees.\n\nJUST WATCHED On GPS: Higher ed moves online Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH On GPS: Higher ed moves online 06:48\n\nDon't worry, federal bureaucrats won't be in charge of academic matters. Instead, National U. would hire teams of leading scholars to evaluate and approve courses. Some of the decisions shouldn't be difficult.\n\nFor example, this week, edX is launching a free, nine-week-long online course called \"Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science.\" It will be taught by Dr. Eric Grimson, who is the chancellor of the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr. John Guttag, who leads the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory's Data Driven Medical Research Group. The course materials mirror those taught to some of the smartest students in the world on MIT's campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIt seems likely that this is a good course.\n\nA degree from National U.\n\nNational U., moreover, wouldn't be limited to courses from existing colleges. Any higher education provider, public or private sector, could submit a course for approval. Those that aren't already accredited would pay a fee to cover the cost of evaluation.\n\nNational U. would also map out which courses students need to take to earn an associate or bachelor's degree. This won't be difficult, since existing colleges have already established a standard set of requirements: a certain number of approved lower- and upper-division courses, plus an approved sequence in an academic major, adding up to 60 or 120 credits. Once students complete the credits, National U. will grant them a degree.\n\nJUST WATCHED This is how an online college gets made Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This is how an online college gets made 02:37\n\nWhile many of the courses will be free, students will bear small costs for taking exams through secure online channels or in-person testing facilities. (Textbooks will be free and open-source). Students will also pay a modest fee of a few hundred dollars for the degree itself, enough to defray the operating costs of National U.\n\nLower-income students will be able to pay for those expenses using the same federal grant and loan programs they currently use to pay tuition at accredited colleges. Since National U. will likely be much cheaper, this will actually save the taxpayers money in the long run.\n\nIf it all sounds too good to be true, keep in mind that free online courses from the likes of MIT are a very recent phenomenon. Higher education policies just haven't adapted to them \u2014 yet.\n\nThe federal government's higher education approval powers are long-established. Now it just needs to use them on behalf of students, instead of traditional colleges and universities that are charging far too much. George Washington was right all along.\n\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. \u200b",

MUST WATCH CNN Hero Umra Omar: Safari Doctors 02:25\n\nOn a visit to her childhood community in the islands, she learned about a life-saving medical aid project that had been abandoned because of the security concerns.\n\nToday, Safari Doctors provides free basic medical services -- including immunizations, maternal health care and treatment for malaria and other common diseases in the region -- to more than 1,000 people a year.\n\nDespite the risk, and Omar's current pregnancy, she makes bi-monthly trips as much as possible to help those who desperately need it.\n\nCNN spoke with Omar about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.\n\nCNN: You now live full-time on one of the islands; you also lived there as a young girl. What are these communities like?\n\nUmra Omar: We are identified as the Bajuni and the Boni communities who are the indigenous people. So we have people who've never stepped out of the village at all; never, maybe, had an experience of running water. We have communities that, right now, have no schools within walking distance. Lamu is the only county in Kenya that has less than one kilometer of paved road.\n\nThe same thing that makes it beautiful, isolated and pristine, is the same thing that presents the challenges for access to health care. From the southernmost tip, which is in Lamu, all the way to the northernmost tip, that's a two-hour speedboat (ride), about $300. For the average person from Lamu, that's not something you just cough up to run to the district hospital.\n\nUmra Omar poses with other members of Safari Doctors, which brings health care to rural Kenya\n\nCNN: How does it all come together?\n\nOmar: We put together a trip for Safari Doctors like we would a thousand-piece puzzle. You just have to know what the picture looks like to put it together.\n\nWe're fortunate to be from a very intertwined area, from government all the way to the fishermen on a boat. And we at Safari Doctors are tapping into that to be able to fill some of the gaps in accessing health care.\n\nSo it's just a matter of us pulling in different pieces to see how we can work on this issue of accessing health care from the very basic level of getting medicines out to people to a more complex angle of bringing in consultants and professionals.\n\nCNN: Do you feel scared?\n\nOmar: Scared, no. It's only dangerous if you feel really threatened. And frankly speaking, we don't feel like we're doing something that should warrant us being threatened or a target, because there's no agenda other than life behind it. And if anybody feels like life is wrong, then there's nothing we can do about it.\n\nCNN: You are 6 months pregnant and have a toddler at home. What keeps you going?\n\nOmar cradles a baby in Safari Doctors' care\n\nOmar: So I'm pregnant, but not yet barefoot! And that's supposed to be happening in November. But it's something that I feel like wouldn't necessarily put the brakes on anything in any way whatsoever. I think this is a Safari Doctors baby!\n\nBeing here, being close to home, to be able to fill some of the gaps in accessing health care, it's kind of been an IV drip for life and purpose.\n\nWant to get involved? Check out the Safari Doctors website and see how to help.\n\nYou can make a donation right now to Safari Doctors.

    "text": "CNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge impact on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the \"2 degrees\" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\n\n(CNN) tl;dr version : You can vote on the first story I'll report as part of this new series on 2 degrees Celsius -- which is the agreed-upon threshold for dangerous climate change. Go here if you don't see the poll . Thanks!\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn 2013, I did something that's a little scary for a journalist.\n\nI asked you to tell me what to cover.\n\nThose experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of democratic journalism. Editors shouldn't get all the control. You, the audience, have a vital say, too.\n\nStill, in the two years since I asked for your ideas, I haven't done much, if anything, to address one of the topics you most frequently asked me to cover : climate change.\n\nI'm hoping to make good on your request now.\n\nStarting today, Earth Day, I'm planning to spend the rest of the year writing about one tiny little number -- 2 degrees. It may be the most important number you've never heard of.\n\nMaybe that plan sounds excessive.\n\n(Eight months reporting on one number!?)\n\nBut here's why it matters: If we humans warm the world more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), we greatly up the odds of climate catastrophes.\n\nThink super droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions and acidifying oceans.\n\nWe don't want to cross that mark.\n\nHumans never have lived in post-2-degree world, said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, based in Germany, and author of a paper on this history of 2 degrees.\n\n\"If we start warming the planet way beyond what humans have ever experienced, God knows what will wait for us,\" he told me.\n\nGood news, though. If we drastically cut carbon emissions, we can stay below the 2-degree threshold. As part of this series, I'll be exploring exactly what it would take to do so.\n\nThis matters a great deal this year, since the United Nations will gather leaders and policy experts in Paris in December to try to hammer out a new international agreement on climate change. Two degrees will be one useful benchmark to see if the world is on track.\n\n\"It's almost kind of like a truth keeping mechanism,\" said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute. \"It would be hard if it didn't exist to have a sense of whether countries are on track or not.\"\n\nIt's not a perfect yardstick. But it's a reasonable one. Think of it like a speed limit, said Jaeger, the economist in Germany. Would a 51 mph limit be better than 50? Or maybe it should be 49? The point isn't the exact number, it's the ballpark: 200 mph would certainly be too fast, as he put it, but 20 mph is too slow.\n\nFor climate change, the point is we don't know the world will fall into crisis at exactly 2 degrees and not 2.1 or 1.8. But that range is certainly dangerous.\n\n\"The way I think of it is like smoking,\" said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech. \"How many cigarettes are too many? I don't know. I have no idea. Nobody has any idea. But we do know the more cigarettes you smoke, the greater the risk.\"\n\nTwo degrees, then, is our most educated estimate. A way to focus attention.\n\nIt's incredibly valuable in that respect.\n\nSince the number emerged from a relatively obscure academic paper in the 1970s, it's become widely agreed upon in the international community. In 2009, for example, 114 countries initially signed onto the \"Copenhagen Accord,\" a nonbinding agreement that recognizes the \"scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius.\"\n\nThat level of consensus is rare on this topic.\n\n\"If there's one thing the world has agreed upon about climate change it's 2 degrees should be the benchmark,\" said Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org , an advocacy group.\n\nI'll be writing more about the origins of 2 degrees soon -- where this number came from (one guy, turns out, and I chatted with him), how soon we may cross that mark if we don't take action (short answer: 2050), and how much we've warmed the planet since the start of the industrial revolution, in the late 1800s, which is how these temperature increases are usually measured (0.85 degrees).\n\nRight now, though, I'd like to ask you to do something that's scary and exciting.\n\nI want you to vote on the first project I'll report for this series.\n\nAll of the options center on one theme: What does a post-2-degree world look like?\n\nI love that question because it -- like all six choices you'll see below -- came from you.\n\nCNN hosted a Facebook chat on Friday , asking our audience to come up with questions for me about climate change or about 2 degrees of warming. Many of you said you wanted to know what a 2-degree world would have in store, in general. Other folks asked about specific impacts to people and ecosystems if the climate continues to inch toward that dangerous 2-degree mark.\n\nClay Miller, from Alaska, for example, asked about the Arctic.\n\nCindy Johnson wanted to know which animals would go extinct first.\n\nJon Locke was among those curious about farms.\n\nAnd many of you, including Kayla Helton, from Florida, asked about rising seas. Kelly, a 48-year-old from California, wanted to know what would happen to \"climate refugees\" as the coast vanishes.\n\nTell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees Posted by CNN on Tuesday, April 21, 2015\n\nThe topic with the most votes on Monday at 5 p.m. ET is the one I'll report in May.\n\nLook for more votes like this in the future as we explore this number together.\n\nIf you'd like to follow along, consider subscribing to my \"2-degree\" newsletter\n\nsocial Or you can track me down on the usual networks , including Snapchat.\n\nI'm @jdsutter on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\n\nI think of this kind of like non-fiction improv: You throw out the prompts, and I'll go out there looking for the most interesting and informative story. It's an experiment, to be sure. And it scares the hell out of me. But climate change is a topic so big -- so critical to the future of our planet and humanity species -- that we've gotta be in this together.",

    "text": "(CNN) France has become the first country in the world to ban disposable plastic cups and plates.\n\nA new French law will require all disposable tableware to be made from 50% biologically-sourced materials that can be composted at home by January of 2020. That number will rise to 60% by January of 2025.\n\nThe measure is an addition to France's \" Energy Transition for Green Growth Act ,\" a wide-reaching law adopted last year with the aim of mitigating the impact of climate change.\n\nFrance hopes to become a world leader in environmental and energy solutions, catalyzed by the COP21 Climate Change conference held in Paris last December.\n\nOne hundred and fifty single-use cups are thrown away every second in the country -- 4.73 billion per year, according to the French Association of Health and Environment, ASEF.\n\nOnly 1% of them is recycled, largely because they are made of a mixture of polypropylene and polystyrene.\n\nIndustry backlash\n\nWhile the French ban has been cheered by many, others are not happy.\n\nPack2GoEurope, an industry association representing Europe's leading food-packaging manufacturers, said that the measure violates EU law on the free movement of goods.\n\nIt has asked the EU Commission to block the French law and is consulting with lawyers about taking legal action against France.\n\n\"Finding a package that meets the really critical food hygiene requirements that consumers want, that can also be composted in a domestic composter...right now they don't exist,\" said Eamonn Bates, secretary general of the Brussels-based body.\n\n\"My members are not against bio plastics or new products. But the industry does oppose them being imposed for certain applications especially when the life-cycle analysis shows that there is no environmental basis for doing so,\" he said.\n\nThere is debate within scientific and manufacturing sectors as to whether the energy required to produce environmentally-friendly plastics is greener than the alternatives.\n\nResearchers at the Netherlands' Wageningen University who investigated the potential of the materials found that while bio plastics represent the most viable future alternative to oil-based products, the processes used to produce them need to become more energy-efficient to make them worthwhile.\n\nPlastic bags banned\n\nFrance's new law is the work of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, French minister for Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy.\n\nHer \"Green Growth\" plan seeks to cut landfill waste in half by 2025 and reduce greenhouse emissions 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.\n\nIn July, France imposed a total ban on the distribution of lightweight plastic bags at supermarket checkouts, a measure already in place in several countries.\n\nBangladesh became the first nation to ban the bags in 2002, after they blocked up drainage systems during flooding. Countries including South Africa, Kenya, China, Rwanda and Mexico have followed suit, along with certain states of the US.\n\nRetailers in the United Kingdom and New York City charge customers a small fee for plastic bags at supermarkets. In Ireland, the 0.17 Euro ($0.19) fee introduced in 2002 reduced plastic bag usage from 328 per person to 14 per person in 2014. The fee has now increased to 0.22 Euros ($0.25).",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\nAnd America has a message for him: That kind of crass sexism may have sold tabloids in the '90s, but it loses you elections in a more feminist, body-positive 2016.\n\nHis poor performance at the first presidential debate was brought into even sharper relief by a stunning show from Hillary Clinton, who pointedly brought up Trump's chauvinist treatment of women.\n\n\"And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them, and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,\" Clinton said.\n\nThat woman, Clinton said, \" is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.\"\n\nTrump called into \"Fox and Friends\" early Tuesday morning to defend his debate performance. He was particularly fixated on Machado, upset that she had the nerve to act like a real human woman and speak for herself, instead of playing the role of a silent, malleable doll.\n\nJUST WATCHED Former 'Miss Universe' speaks out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former 'Miss Universe' speaks out 01:08\n\nThe former Miss Universe, he said, was \"the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst. She was impossible.\" He continued, \"she was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem.\" The \"Fox and Friends\" hosts sat in a kind of stunned, uncomfortable silence\n\nYou can't blame Trump for thinking he would have a receptive audience -- Fox, after all, was run for years by Trump friend and possible political advisor Roger Ailes, who recently left the network amid allegations of sexual harassment. (Fox had to pay $20 million to former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson to settle her lawsuit.)\n\nJUST WATCHED Clinton blasts Trump over treatment of beauty queen Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton blasts Trump over treatment of beauty queen 01:38\n\nAnd it's well-known that Trump has long treated the women in his private and professional life as primarily decorative, commenting crudely about the figures of his progressively younger model wives and even his daughters, calling women he dislikes slobs and pigs, and r unning beauty pageants that were unabashed about rewarding sex appeal over substance.\n\nBack in 1997, Trump was the Miss Universe pageant's executive producer, and when the holder of the crown put on a few pounds he demanded that she diet and exercise until she again fit his ideal aesthetic. He ambushed her at the gym with reporters and photographers in tow, a humiliation Machado says has followed her all her life since.\n\nBut even though Trump intentionally demeaned Machado, a teenage girl back then, there was no significant media backlash. As happened with so many of his other decisions, Trump saw no consequences.\n\nUntil now. Trump, it seems, doesn't comprehend how much the United States has changed in the past 20 years. He realizes that blue-collar white men are angry, and certainly plays to their resentments of increasingly successful women and people of color. What he's missed, though, is that women have changed, too. We aren't going to cower -- not even if you call us fat.\n\nFat women still face pervasive prejudice -- they get paid less and are less likely to be hired for a job than their thinner counterparts, and in much of the country, it's still perfectly legal to discriminate based on size.\n\nBut a reinvigorated feminist movement and its overlap with movements for fat acceptance mean broader awareness of the harms that narrow beauty ideals can cause, and a more generalized disgust at men who feel entitled to judge women's bodies. Beauty pageants are on the decline. Companies increasingly tout the use of \"real women\" in their ads, or their refusal to airbrush photos of models. Americans are, in general, larger than we've been in the past.\n\nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter. We welcome your ideas and comments.\n\nThat means more Americans know the sting of anti-fat bias, and aren't laughing along when Trump c alls a beauty contest winner an \"eating machine.\" There is also strength in those numbers: The more Americans self-identify as fat and refuse to accept that being fat makes them less worthy of love, respect, and being treated with basic humanity, the less public figures like Trump can get away with using weight as a tool of sexist humiliation, and the more antics like this will hurt him in November.",

He said as many as 200,000 people will leave Thursday.\n\nTempers apparently flared during the slow traffic out of Charleston. A man got out of his truck at point where vehicles were being redirected, removed a traffic cone and sped away. Police chased the man until he stopped on a dead-end road. Berkeley County Chief Deputy Mike Cochran told CNN that the man fired at deputies and police officers, who shot back and wounded the man.\n\nThe man was hospitalized, but his condition is unknown.\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Transportation changed the directions of eastbound traffic lanes to accommodate the exodus of people leaving coastal cities like Charleston.\n\nThere were traffic jams on I-26 as far west as Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nBut as thousands fled inland Wednesday, not everyone chose to evacuate. In Charleston, which likely will see the powerful storm's impact this weekend, some people were boarding up businesses.\n\n\"I think we're staying put,\" Cheryl Quinn told CNN's Stephanie Elam.\n\nQuinn and her husband said they were fine a year ago when Charleston endured heavy rain after a brush with a big storm.\n\n\"It was kind of a party down here. I hate to say that,\" because storms can be scary, she added.\n\nStill, Quinn has reserved a hotel room just in case.\n\nNorth Carolina playing it by ear\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency for more than half the state's 100 counties. The changing forecast now predicts the storm won't have as great an impact on the state as once feared, and Matthew might even turn around before it gets there.\n\nJUST WATCHED See Hurricane Matthew churn from space Replay More Videos ...

Here are some more suggestions for binge-worthy shows and series. Hide Caption 1 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Game of Thrones' \u2013 With dozens episodes so far, including some that ran more than an hour, we can't imagine watching the first five seasons of \"Game of Thrones\" in one sitting. But one Redditor claimed to have watched three seasons in two and a half days, so anything's possible. Hide Caption 2 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Mr. Robot' \u2013 Christian Slater, left, plays the titular character on \"Mr. Robot,\" the anarchist leader of a hackers collective that includes Rami Malek. The pilot premiered online and via streaming services in May and was renewed for a second season before its USA network premiere in June. Malek's main character has drawn praise for his portrayal of a security engineer and vigilante hacker who struggles with social anxiety disorder and clinical depression. Often, plot lines dealing with national security and privacy ring true to life. Hide Caption 3 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt' \u2013 Viewers either love or hate Tina Fey's Netflix passion project, \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" starring Ellie Kemper. Fans gobbled up the campy comedy when it launched, with many making it through the first 13 episodes in one sitting. Hide Caption 4 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'The X-Files' \u2013 With a reboot on the way there's no better time to binge-watch \"The X-Files,\" which originally aired on Fox for nine seasons from 1993 to 2002. Hide Caption 5 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Silicon Valley' \u2013 With only two seasons and 18 episodes to its name, \"Silicon Valley\" was a highly rated choice for binge-watching. Each episode is packed with raunchy jokes and cringe-inducing nerdiness to make viewing a breeze. Hide Caption 6 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Twin Peaks' \u2013 With a reboot of David Lynch's cult series \"Twin Peaks\" planned for 2017, there's no better time to catch up on the backstory of who killed Laura Palmer (played by Cheryl Lee). Hide Caption 7 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Master of None' \u2013 Hit comedy \"Master of None\" made its debut on Netflix in November. Comedian Aziz Ansari plays a 30-something struggling to make sense of life in New York City in a way that anyone who's even been a 30-something will relate to. Hide Caption 8 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Jessica Jones' \u2013 Krysten Ritter is winning over fans and critics in \" Jessica Jones ,\" the story of a semiretired superhero turned private eye based on Marvel Comics' \"Alias.\" It's the latest comic book adaptation for adults about an ongoing mystery in Jones' life that's hard to interrupt once you load the series on Netflix. Hide Caption 9 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Bloodline' \u2013 The premise of \"Bloodline\" could appeal to anyone who's ever had family tension. But a taste for the macabre is required to sit through the first season of this Netflix drama, which stars Kyle Chandler (\"Friday Night Lights\"). The second season is expected in 2016. Hide Caption 10 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Homeland' \u2013 Showtime's espionage thriller \"Homeland\" thrives on twists and turns -- some of which threaten the fate of the world -- with a splash of romantic tension and family drama thrown into the mix. If you love high stakes or secretly wish you were a government spy, this is your show. Hide Caption 11 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'The Honourable Woman' \u2013 \"The Honourable Woman\" is an unfolding mystery, holding back just enough in each episode to keep the intentions of powerful businesswoman Nessa Stein hidden until the very end. This eight-episode political thriller, which won Maggie Gyllenhaal a Golden Globe for best actress, won't have a second season, so it's perfect for a quick, one-day binge. Hide Caption 12 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'The Americans' \u2013 With the fourth season of \"The Americans\" starting in March 2016, there's no better time to catch up on this Cold War thriller. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys star as two Soviet KGB officers posing as an American couple in the suburbs of Washington. From there, it's one plot twist after another to see how things will end for them. Hide Caption 13 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Peep Show' \u2013 With only six episodes to a season, British sitcom \" Peep Show \" was a popular choice among Redditors for being \"easy to knock out a few in the afternoon,\" and hilarious to boot. Anyone new to the mundane world of South London roommates Mark Corrigan (David Mitchell) and Jeremy \"Jez\" Usborne (Robert Webb) will have plenty of hours of inner monologues and point-of-view shots to wade through. The show debuted in 2003 and is now in its ninth season. Hide Caption 14 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Band of Brothers' \u2013 For some American history buffs, the World War II series \"Band of Brothers\" is worthy of an annual viewing, even if it takes 11 hours. The 10-part miniseries based on the World War II journey of the U.S. Army 101st Airborne's Easy Company features an ensemble cast of stars before they became famous -- Michael Fassbender, Ron Livingston, Marc Warren, Simon Pegg, Damian Lewis, James McAvoy and Tom Hardy, to name a few. Hide Caption 15 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Dead Like Me' \u2013 \"Dead Like Me\" earned points for being \"funny as s---t\" thanks to a cast that included Mandy Patinkin, Jasmine Guy and Ellen Muth playing grim reapers who walk among us. \"They knew when to cut and run before it got stupid,\" one Redditor said. Binge-watchers can draw their own conclusions over whether \"Dead Like Me\" -- which was created by Bryan Fuller (\"Hannibal,\" \"Wonderfalls\") -- was canceled prematurely after two seasons while breezing through its 29 episodes. Hide Caption 16 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'House of Cards' \u2013 Political thriller \"House of Cards\" may be binge-worthy by design as a Netflix original series that comes out one season at a time. But some recommend only watching a few episodes in each sitting to better savor the saga of Frank and Claire Underwood's conniving ways. The series stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright. Hide Caption 17 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Battlestar Galactica' \u2013 Ron Moore's Peabody Award winning-remake of the 1970s sci-fi classic \"Battlestar Galactica\" aired for four seasons, ending its run in 2009. Darker and more somber than the original, the series perfectly reflected the fears and anxieties of our post-9/11 lives (and the end of its second season featured one of the best cliffhangers in TV history ). Be warned, it's easy to \"over\" binge-watch this show. Just ask the folks from \"Portlandia.\" Hide Caption 18 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'True Detective' \u2013 If the intriguing plot isn't enough to keep you hooked from one episode to the next of HBO's \"True Detective,\" what about Matthew McConaughey's performance? His transformation from clean-cut to grizzled alone makes the first season a prime candidate for binge-watching -- though fans weren't as thrilled with season 2 Hide Caption 19 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Firefly' \u2013 \"Watching the first episode of 'Firefly' and deciding to binge-watch the rest is like getting into a relationship with someone you know will die in 24 hours.\" That pretty much sums up how fans felt after FOX pulled the plug on the Joss Whedon cult hit in 2003. It also makes \"Firefly\" short and captivating enough to watch in a day. Hide Caption 20 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Arrested Development' \u2013 \"Arrested Development\" lends itself to multiple binges for all the inside jokes that are easily missed on the first, second or third viewings. \"That and the foreshadowing,\" said one Redditor. \"Lots of foreshadowing.\" Read this thread for a refresher on some of the dysfunctional Bluth family's more memorable moments. Hide Caption 21 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Breaking Bad' \u2013 With so many plot twists and the ongoing character development, AMC's \"Breaking Bad\" was a popular choice for binge-watching from beginning to end. Season 2 posed a problem for some, but \"if you can get over that season 2 hump, you'll probably enjoy it a lot,\" one Redditor said Hide Caption 22 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Dexter' \u2013 The saga of \"Dexter,\" America's favorite forensic expert/serial killer, went on for 96 episodes over eight seasons, so it's probably not possible to binge-watch from start to finish in one sitting. But one Redditor claimed to watch four seasons in about a week, so there's a starting point. Hide Caption 23 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Deadwood' \u2013 Even with what many consider to be an unsatisfactory ending, Redditors agreed that HBO's \"Deadwood\" is a prime candidate for binging thanks to its sharp writing and memorable characters. \"It's a slow burn of a show, but once you are hooked ... you ARE IN FOR LIFE. Or 3 seasons,\" one Redditor said Hide Caption 24 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Freaks and Geeks' \u2013 \"So easy to binge watch because it's so short,\" as one Redditor said, and, \"like 'Firefly,' you'll feel heartache when it's over.\" Judd Apatow's short-lived \"Freaks and Geeks\" captured the awkwardness of high school in one short season from 1999 to 2000. It also shows stars Seth Rogan, James Franco and Jason Segel getting their start in front of the camera. Hide Caption 25 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'The West Wing' \u2013 Political drama \"The West Wing\" ran seven seasons from 1999 to 2006, drawing critical and popular acclaim. Though some debate the quality of the show after creator Aaron Sorkin's departure after season 4, the characters and dialogue kept audiences hooked, making it a strong candidate for reruns and binge-watching. Hide Caption 26 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Orphan Black' \u2013 \"Orphan Black\" fans have eagerly tuned in each week to see the talented Tatiana Maslany act opposite herself as clones, sometimes assuming up to five roles in the same episode. Cliffhanger endings in each episode make binge-watching all the more satisfying, especially while fans await season 4. Hide Caption 27 of 30\n\nPhotos: Most binge-worthy TV shows 'Better off Ted' \u2013 Another from the \"short but great\" files, \"Better Off Ted\" only lasted for two seasons and 26 episodes on ABC. \"The marketing made it seem really awful and stereotypical. I avoided it like the plague until it came up on Netflix. Now I wish I had helped its ratings more on network TV,\" one Redditor said . The show concerns a single father who works for a ruthless corporation, Veridian Dynamics (motto: \"Money before people\"), and was created by Victor Fresco (\"Andy Richter Controls the Universe\").

The popular sci-fi show hooked viewers for 10 seasons from 1997 to 2007 through memorable characters, scenes and quotable dialogue, creating a passionate fan base that seems eager to return to the show multiple times. \"When I first binged the series, multiple times I noticed that it was 5AM.

    "text": "The five-time grand slam champion has had her two-year drugs ban reduced to 15 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), meaning she will be back in time for the French Open in May 2017.\n\nSharapova tested positive for banned substance meldonium at the Australian Open in January and was subsequently banned for two years by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).\n\nBut CAS has shaved nine months off that original verdict, meaning Sharapova is eligible to compete again on April 26.\n\n\"The panel found that Ms. Sharapova committed an anti-doping rule violation and that while it was with \"no significant fault,\" she bore some degree of fault, for which a sanction of 15 months is appropriate,\" CAS said Tuesday in a statement on its official website.\n\n\"The panel wishes to point out that the case it heard, and the award it has rendered, was only about the degree of fault that can be imputed to the player for her failure to make sure that the substance contained in a product that she had been taking over a long period remained in compliance with the anti-doping rules.\"\n\nSharapova relief\n\nSharapova immediately expressed her relief at the reduction of her ban, and took aim at the ITF, saying she hoped it would learn from this experience.\n\n\"I've gone from one of the toughest days of my career last March when I learned about my suspension to now, one of my happiest days, as I found out I can return to tennis in April,\" she said in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"In so many ways, I feel like something I love was taken away from me and it will feel really good to have it back. Tennis is my passion and I have missed it. I am counting the days until I can return to the court. I have learned from this, and I hope the ITF has as well. CAS concluded that \"the panel has determined it does not agree with many of the conclusions of the (ITF) Tribunal.\"\n\nShe went on to justify her use of meldonium, which is also known as mildronate.\n\n\"I have taken responsibility from the very beginning for not knowing that the over-the-counter supplement I had been taking for the last 10 years was no longer allowed. But I also learned how much better other federations were at notifying their athletes of the rule change, especially in Eastern Europe where mildronate is commonly taken by millions of people,\" the Russian said.\n\nHer legal team provided a list of examples of other sports where ruling bodies had provided warnings about this year's change in status of meldonium.\n\nMaria's 1st statement since reduced ban throws the ITF under the bus. Why not just be grateful about ability to return sooner & go practice! \u2014 Pam Shriver (@PHShriver) October 4, 2016\n\n\"Now that this process is over, I hope the ITF and other relevant tennis anti-doping authorities will study what these other federations did, so that no other tennis player will have to go through what I went through,\" Sharapova added.\n\n\"And to my fans, I thank you so much for living and breathing so many of these tough months together. During this time, I have learned the true meaning of a fan and I am so fortunate to have had your support. I'm coming back soon and I can't wait.\"\n\nTennis world stunned\n\nThe sport was plunged into shock in March when Sharapova announced at a Los Angeles press conference she had failed a drugs test. A provisional ban was announced by the ITF shortly after.\n\nSharapova said she was first prescribed meldonium, also known as mildronate, in 2006 for heart issues and was unaware it had been added to the banned substance list by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as of January 1.\n\nShe acknowledged taking it before each match she played at the Australian Open as she was knocked out of the tournament at the quarterfinal stage by her nemesis Serena Williams.\n\nHanding down the two-year ban, an independent panel appointed by the ITF ruled Sharapova hadn't used meldonium as a vehicle for cheating but stated the former world No. 1 was \"the sole author of her misfortune.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED A look back at Maria Sharapova's career Replay More Videos ...

The tribunal found that I did not seek treatment from my doctor for the purpose of obtaining a performance enhancing substance.\n\n\"The ITF spent tremendous amounts of time and resources trying to prove I intentionally violated the anti-doping rules and the tribunal concluded I did not.\"\n\nThe two-year ban is in line with non-specified substances such as meldonium for first-time offenders who aren't deemed to have intentionally cheated. The ITF had sought a four-year punishment.\n\nImmediate appeal\n\nSharapova, who was this year unseated as the world's richest female athlete by Serena Williams after 11 years at the top, announced instantly she would be appealing to CAS.\n\nShe claimed she had been taking meldonium since 2006 for heart issues, a magnesium deficiency and because her family has a history of diabetes.\n\nMeldonium was added to the prohibited list \"because of evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance,\" WADA said on its website.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why would athletes use meldonium? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why would athletes use meldonium? 01:15\n\nPotential benefits include boosting endurance and aiding the recovery process, though Sharapova's lawyers produced statements from doctors denying the drug aids performance.\n\nSharapova took meldonium before matches but never declared it on doping control forms, including at the Australian Open this year.\n\nShe tested positive five times for meldonium in 2015 -- but not during the period when she reached the Australian Open final after winning a Brisbane warmup event. Her defense team said she forgot to take it and other drugs she used at tournaments (magnerot and riboxin) with her Down Under on that occasion.\n\nSharapova said she simply failed to read an email that stated meldonium would be added to the banned list on January 1 this year. In evidence heard during the tribunal it was stated her IMG agent Max Eisenbud also failed to check.\n\nEisenbud was the sole member of her current entourage who knew she was taking the drug -- not her coach Sven Groeneveld, physiotherapist or nutritionist -- the panel heard.\n\nMissed Olympics\n\nSharapova, who has continued to promote her candy company Sugarpova since being suspended, had hoped to fast track proceedings at CAS in a bid to make the Rio Olympics.\n\nWith the ITF she had agreed to an ''expedited procedure'' which was due to see CAS's verdict delivered in July.

The amount of blood needed for each varies.\n\nYet experts say the device isn't so revolutionary that it would warrant the $9 billion valuation that Theranos once claimed. Competitors like Quest (DGX) and Siemens (SIEGY) sell devices with similar benefits that are already on the market.\n\nHolmes said Wednesday that the company's new executive team is working to obtain clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, build commercial partnerships and publish in scientific journals.\n\nRelated: Theranos ... in 2 minutes: $9 billion startup in the spotlight\n\nIn October 2015, the Wall Street Journal published articles calling Theranos' claims and blood testing methods into question. Theranos has continued to contest the allegations against it.\n\nThe firm, founded by Holmes at age 19, positioned itself as a provider of cheaper, more efficient alternatives to traditional medical tests. It said it could process up to 70 lab tests on just a few drops of blood.\n\nThe company has faced scrutiny from Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.\n\nThose probes came on top of an inspection by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which later revoked the license of Theranos' California blood-testing facility and imposed the lab ban on Holmes.\n\n-- Sara Ashley O'Brien contributed to this report",

But Watters also asks his subjects if he should bow when saying hello, accuses a street vendor of selling stolen watches, and asks one stranger if he knows karate -- which originated in Okinawa, now part of Japan.\n\n\"This is one of the most blatantly racist things I have ever seen,\" Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times tech reporter, tweeted. \"How can anyone at Fox News defend this?

    "text": "John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\nAtlanta (CNN) Before I launch into the argument for making all restrooms in the United States gender neutral -- that is, removing \"men's\" and \"women's\" labels -- I want to show you a photo.\n\nThis is James Parker Sheffield.\n\nNow a truly ridiculous question: Which restroom do you think he should use?\n\nMen's or women's?\n\nIn the United States at the moment, the legal answer depends on location. If Sheffield is in North Carolina, it's illegal for him to use a public men's restroom. Since he's a transgender man -- his birth certificate has an \"F\" on it -- he has to use the women's.\n\nIf he's at home in Atlanta, he can use the men's.\n\n\"It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife,\" Sheffield wrote on Twitter along with his selfie. He posted that message in March, only hours after North Carolina passed a law making it illegal for transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond with their true gender identities.\n\nAs it's written, Sheffield would have to use the lady's room or break the law.\n\nThat's absurd, as the selfie and tweet make clear. Sheffield is a 36-year-old man who lives in Decatur, Georgia. He has a scruffy beard and a receding hairline, which he jokingly calls a \"reverse fade.\" If he walked into a lady's restroom he'd likely be met with stares or screams or worse.\n\nBut you know what else is absurd? The idea that Sheffield -- or anyone else -- should have to choose a male or female restroom at all. And, beyond that, that any of us would feel entitled to decide someone else's gender for them -- and, consequently, where they can and can't pee.\n\nThis isn't a binary gender world. People don't fit neatly into the \"M\" and \"F\" boxes. It's time our public restrooms reflected that. The fairest way to do so is to desegregate restrooms by sex, and that means eliminating the men's and women's rooms in favor of \"all gender\" restrooms.\n\nThink that's an overreaction? Take a quick look at the history of bathroom politics in the United States. We've tried time and again to control who we sit and stand next to at the toilet.\n\nIn the 1960s, black civil rights activists were killed for trying to use \"whites only\" bathrooms. In the 1980s, gay men were harassed because the public wrongly assumed they could catch HIV-AIDS from a toilet. (AIDS was viewed then as a gay man's disease). Restrooms weren't required to be accessible to people with wheelchairs until the Americans with Disabilities act of 1990. And now, some cities and states are trying to keep transgender people out.\n\nThe only justification is bigotry and ignorance.\n\nYou might think that allowing a transgender person to use the restroom of their choice is a workable solution. It's a first step. But Sheffield and others who don't conform to gender norms face discrimination even when they're legally allowed to choose which restroom to use.\n\nSeventy percent of transgender people surveyed in Washington, for example, a city with progressive laws allowing people to use either restroom, reported \"verbal harassment, assault and being denied access to public restrooms\" because of their identities, according to a report from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles . Further, 54% reported medical problems \"like dehydration, urinary tract infections, kidney infections and other kidney problems\" because they avoided using restrooms entirely.\n\n@PatMcCroryNC It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife. #HB2 #trans #NorthCarolina #shameonNC pic.twitter.com/4b4OdmfmeN \u2014 James P Sheffield (@JayShef) March 24, 2016\n\nSheffield told me he plans his days around where he can and can't pee.\n\n\"I almost never go to the restroom in a place I haven't been at least once before,\" he told me. He cuts appointments short and avoids going out simply to avoid peeing in public. Sometimes he'll find the one stall in a men's room is occupied, or out of order. Other times he sits on the toilet for longer than necessary because he worries it's suspicious a man would sit down to urinate.\n\n\"It's not a good feeling to be a grown-up and wondering, 'Am I going to make it to a restroom on time -- and how do you explain it if you don't,'\" he said.\n\nSuch fears apply not only to transgender people but also those who don't meet our rigid gender norms. In 2013, I met a female middle school student in Mississippi , for example, who told me her teachers wouldn't let her use the girl's restroom because she had short hair and wore hoodies. She looked too boyish.\n\nJUST WATCHED Young and out in Mississippi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Young and out in Mississippi 03:15\n\nGendered restrooms support these biases.\n\n\"We need a restroom revolution in this country,\" said Kathryn Anthony, an architecture professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nI agree. And there are simple places to start. Restaurants and small businesses with two single-unit restrooms simply can paint over the \"M\" and \"W\" on their doors and -- ba-da-bing! -- they're gender inclusive. No one's harmed as long as we men stop peeing on the toilet seat.\n\nPhiladelphia recently made that concept law for single-stall bathrooms. Other governments and businesses should follow. (And if you're a business that is considering this sort of move, please send me a tweet ).\n\nThen, bigger leaps: The International Building Code should suggest all-gender restrooms become the norm, or at least be included, in larger businesses and public establishments. (That idea comes from Terry Kogan, a law professor at the University of Utah.)\n\nCity, state and federal governments also could legislate these restrooms into existence, too.\n\nIt won't happen immediately, but new construction and renovations could be subject to our updated understanding of which types of bathrooms are safest for everyone. That's the precedent set by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Kogan said.\n\nHarvey Molotch, a professor of sociology at New York University and co-editor of the book \"Toilet: public restrooms and the politics of sharing,\" outlined for me what he considers to be the Holy Grail of restrooms. Walk in and you'd see a long line of private toilet stalls, with floor-to-ceiling doors. On the other side would be a row of communal sinks. Anyone is free to use any stall -- and there might be a row of urinals tucked away somewhere to the side.\n\nThe urinals could be left out of some restrooms, but they should be kept when possible, Molotch said, because they're much more water-efficient than sit-down toilets.\n\nAll this sounds wildly inoffensive to me.\n\nAnd it's already happening.\n\nThe Cooper Union, a college in New York, announced on March 18 that it is removing gender identification from restrooms on campus and opening single-occupancy toilets up for anyone's use. \"We have always been ahead of our time and we must continue being leaders on issues of social justice,\" Bill Mea, acting president, wrote in an email to the campus\n\nThe Urban Justice Center, also in New York, made a similar move a decade ago.\n\n\"I'm delighted to be able to share that our experiences have been wholly positive,\" the center's executive director, Doug Lasdon, and a development associate, Hugh Ryan, wrote in a recent op-ed in the Washington Post . \"To this day, we have not received a single complaint. Not one in a decade. Nor have any incidents of violence or harassment been reported.\"\n\nThere's little counterargument other that bias and squeamishness.\n\nSheffield, the transgender man in Georgia, doesn't expect the all-gender restroom revolution to occur anytime soon. \"If we could go to sleep tonight and wake up and all the bathrooms were gender neutral -- great! But it's not practical,\" he said. \"It's not going to happen that way.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he said, a little courteousness would help.\n\n\"We can't hold it,\" he said. \"Trans people have to pee multiple times a day, just like everyone else.\"\n\nCurrently, there are only two places Sheffield feels comfortable peeing.\n\nOne's at home.\n\nThe other's at work.\n\nAnd that's because it's labeled \"all gender restroom.\"",

    "text": "Michael D'Antonio is the author of \" The Truth About Trump .\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) America has learned some important things in recent days about Donald Trump's children that could change their carefully cultivated images as moderate, millennial emissaries for their father. It turns out they are, first and foremost, Trumps.\n\nThis week Donald Trump Jr. created the latest controversy when he tweeted an image of a bowl of Skittles candy with the message, \"If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you that three would kill you, would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\"\n\nBesides trivializing the plight innocent displaced by war, Trump's flippant tweet gets the math wrong. The risk of being killed by a refugee has been credibly estimated as 1 in 3.6 billion per year. The Washington Post says this number of Skittles would fill one and a half Olympic swimming pools.\n\nSeen in this light, Trump Jr's comments make him much like his father, who at times has advocated deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants by force. Trump Jr. suggests that Americans abandon a moral duty and seek the supposed safety of isolation. This hasn't gone over well , as even the candy's manufacturer noted, \"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\"\n\nLast week, in a Cosmopolitan interview about Trump's child-care proposals, Prachi Gupta confronted Ivanka Trump about her father's statement that pregnancy is \"inconvenient\" for employers. Ivanka flashed some of her father's style. \"I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions,\" she complained. \"I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\"\n\nIvanka then got testy: \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments.\" This was a page from the playbook of her father, who has frequently insulted journalists who ask tough questions. As he once explained to me, he only admires reporting that is flattering to him.\n\nFor her part, Ivanka wouldn't allow that Gupta was competent and accurate; she seemed to feel entitled to unconditional support for her father's plan to give new mothers six weeks paid maternity leave. \"He really took ownership of this issue, and I really applaud him for doing that. I hope that, regardless of what your political viewpoint is, this should be celebrated.\"\n\nIvanka cut the interview short and hurried off the phone.

Like his sister, who clearly expected Cosmo's support for his father, Donald Jr. seemed unable to consider that the public might not place his father's interest above all other concerns.\n\nIn the space of roughly 24 hours, the younger Trumps undermined their own images as gracious counterweights to their father's boorishness. They also brought more scrutiny to the issues they hoped to suppress.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump Jr.: Tax release would change dialogue Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump Jr.: Tax release would change dialogue 00:58\n\nQuestions about Trump's tax returns DO persist, especially in light of his running mate Mike Pence's release of his tax records. And Donald Trump's comments about how worker pregnancies are bad for employers HAD indeed been reported far and wide, despite Ivanka Trump's attempts to cast them as misquotes.\n\nThe press also fact-checked Ivanka Trump's erroneous claim that her father's paid-leave proposal is the only one offered in the current campaign. In fact, Hillary Clinton has proposed 12 weeks' leave for the care of a new baby or a sick family member. And in the flurry of press that followed Ivanka's conflict with Cosmo, voters were also reminded that the Trump plan offers nothing for fathers, or men who adopt, and that Trump hotels do not provide workers with paid maternity leave. (Ivanka had said they do.)\n\nHow could Trump's adult children, perhaps his most trusted surrogates, stumble so badly? The answer may be found in their rarefied life experience.\n\nIvanka Trump's offers a good case illustration.\n\nThe making of young Trumps\n\nAs the offspring of one of the richest and most assertive public figures in the world, Ivanka and her brothers have spent almost their entire lives inside a kind of subculture where one person -- their father -- determines what the family, and the family business, stands for. He has been the main source of their social status and economic security, and he controls the multi-billion dollar fortune they stand to inherit. Young Trumps may have their own ideas and points of view, but they are expected to be loyal to their father, and they are.\n\nFor 40 years, the elder Trump has courted controversy and sought to turn his name into a brand recognized around the world. His children, always carefully groomed and outfitted when they appeared for the cameras, became public figures too.\n\nIvanka Trump first experienced the media maelstrom during the tabloid sex scandal that ended her parents' marriage. As her mother, Ivana Trump, and father fueled the press with comments, their children saw the lurid headlines in newspaper headlines and heard gossip at school. In an interview once, Ivanka told me that this experience made her feel closer to her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric \"because it sort of becomes us versus everyone.\"\n\nIndeed, although he has only known wealth and privilege, Donald Trump sees life as a fierce struggle . \"Man is the most vicious of all animals,\" he once said, \"and life is a series of battles ending in victory or defeat. You just can't let people make a sucker out of you.\"\n\nThis defensiveness is shared by his daughter, who recently told the Guardian newspaper that that scandal, which was created by her father's infidelity to her mother, left her with a view of the world as a dangerous place. \"It taught me not to trust anyone,\" she said. \"You can never let your guard down, and I never really have since that time.\"\n\nIn the world the Trumps occupy, battles are waged to gain more wealth and more fame, and the effort requires a certain polished appearance. Men are expected to wear smart suits and avoid baldness at any cost. Women are to be beautiful and fashionable.\n\nFrom the moment she entered public life Ivanka has been noted for her beauty. As a teen, she worked as a fashion model before attending her father's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. Upon graduation, she followed her father's footsteps into real estate. After a brief stint at a competing New York firm, she became a Trump Organization vice president at age 24 and occupied an office in the same building where she once lived in a penthouse apartment.\n\nPhotos: Donald Trump's empire Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presidential nominee, has been in the spotlight for years.

It's time to deliver a victory for the American people.\" Hide Caption 21 of 21\n\nTrump-style ambition\n\nSocially poised and well-spoken, Ivanka is an extremely ambitious young woman who knows how to capitalize on her wealth and fame. She was the first young Trump to appear on his reality TV series, \"The Apprentice,\" and, despite her tender age and limited experience, became an authority figure on the show.\n\nIn 2007, People magazine asked , \"What's your take on your dad's hair? Ivanka replied, 'Maybe I'm just used to it, but I love his hair! I've heard all sorts of crazy things, but I can verify with complete conviction that it's not a hairpiece. It is what it is!\"\n\nAlthough it was a silly moment, Ivanka's response to the hair question revealed her status as a genuine Trump. The issue with Donald's hair is not whether it is real or not. The matter of interest is how he molds it into that unique, swooping structure and why he goes to so much trouble.\n\nFor years, Trump has deflected the question by talking about how he doesn't wear a toupee. Sometimes he invites people to test for themselves by yanking on a specific spot he offers. (I declined when he did this with me.) The deflection is effective, and when she got the chance, Ivanka used the same strategy. She even added a bit of hyperbole -- \"I can very verify with complete conviction\" -- and concluded with a touch of meaningless banter: \"It is what it is,\" which means nothing, but is the kind of decorative, everyman phrase her father uses.\n\nIvanka may not be as brazen as her father when it comes to self-promotion, but she is hardly shy. At age 28, with just five years of post-college experience, she published a book of advice for those who hope to win \"in work and life.\" In promotional videos she explained that the book was a response to a deluge of \"fan mail from adults\" who considered her a role model for their children and from \"young and aspiring businesspeople.\"\n\nThis vocabulary of self-regard is familiar to anyone who has had even a passing exposure to her father.\n\nAmong the influences she credited in describing her book was Fox News founder Roger Ailes, who is reportedly advising her father's campaign. Ailes has recently been accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women employees he supervised. It cost Fox $20 million to settle the lawsuit brought by one of them, former anchor Gretchen Carlson.\n\nIn addition to the book, Ivanka Trump leveraged her fame and family capital to create a jewelry business and a women's fashion line. She has positioned herself as a savvy advisor to women seeking to rise in business. She offers them clothes and shoes that have the look of expensive designer items but cost much less. Ever the keen marketer, she saw opportunity in her recent appearance at the Republican National Convention and is now selling the dress she wore to give a speech for $138.\n\nChips off the old block\n\nLong before he achieved anything in business, Donald Trump built his reputation by dressing in fancy suits and prowling Manhattan in a chauffeur-driven car. He wanted the world to think he was successful and important, and he succeeded by putting style ahead of substance.\n\nAlthough they represent a new generation, Ivanka Trump and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric have also practiced careful image management. Eric has emphasized his charitable endeavors and Donald Jr. has stressed his outdoorsy interests.\n\nBut during the campaign both young men have acquired their father's penchant for loose talk. Eric recently claimed his father said that Gold Star father Khizr Khan, who criticized him, \"sounds like an amazing guy.\" He also said that his father had called Khan \"a hero on so many, on so many different occasions.\" Neither claim was true.\n\nAnd in his second misstep of the past week, Donald Jr. referenced \" gas chambers \" as he complained about the press. This did not go over well with the Jewish Anti-Defamation League, which criticized the statement as a \"trivialization of the Holocaust.\"\n\nOne explanation for the recent problems of the young Trumps may be their sense that they are under fire from critics who don't share their faith in their father. In this family, which considers life a kind of war, outsiders are regarded with wariness and caution. For this reason, the candidate's eldest children have long been his closest partners in business, and they have played key roles in his presidential campaign.\n\nAs a group, the Trump children have tried to position themselves as ambassadors to younger generations of voters. Occasionally this effort falls flat, as it did when they published an appeal that included a photo of them posed, movie-poster style, in a way that made them seem almost robotic.\n\nCommenters had a field day comparing the young Trumps in the photo to movie villains. Mark Lisanti of MTV News quipped, \"Ivanka favors the chainsaw, Junior the machete, and Eric wearing victim flesh-masks.\" Writer Daniel Radosh wrote, \"I love dystopian YA [Young Adult] novels.\"\n\nGlamorous, soft-spoken and more moderate than her father in her politics, Ivanka has generally avoided controversy as she sought to bridge the gap between him and female voters who may feel put-off by the candidate's record of sexist talk. This is, after all, the man who once told an interviewer , \"It doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\"\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn fact, before the Cosmo interview, Ivanka had rarely been confronted directly with her father's record. Her bristling replies suggest that when pressed she will resort to the defensiveness and denial her father has displayed all of her life. This episode startled many in the press who seem surprised to see Ivanka's peevishness and impatience. But under stress, we tend to reveal important parts of ourselves.\n\nIvanka Trump has always lived in the isolation of great wealth and privilege surrounded by Trump loyalists who affirmed her father's outrageous behavior. This existence has to be considered both an opportunity and a trap.\n\nThe opportunity includes access to all the material comforts one can imagine. The trap confines one to a life where deference and obedience are the norm.\n\nThose who expected Ivanka Trump or her brothers to emerge from this environment with the ability to deal patiently and directly with their father's critics expected too much.",

Indeed, millions of Christian evangelicals have been estimated to have sat out the past two elections, with Republicans losing both contests.\n\nFor Trump to produce a different result, turning out the Christian evangelical voters in the battleground states is crucial, something his campaign team has clearly recognized by hiring numerous operatives in key states who are focused on outreach to, and \"get out the vote\" efforts targeted at, Christian evangelicals.\n\nYou only need to look at how tight some of the races were four years ago to see how the stakes are in the battleground states -- and what a difference turning out Christian evangelicals could make.\n\nRead More",

She is the author of \" Dead Man Walking .\" The views expressed are her own.\n\n(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.\n\nAs I was writing \"The Death of Innocents,\" I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was \"taking him on\" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, \"And I'll be right back at ya!\"\n\nIn \"Innocents,\" I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams , whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the \"machinery of death.\"\n\nScalia's experience of the \"meaning\" of capital punishment, as he described it in one of his dissenting opinions, couldn't have been more different from my own. In the marble confines of the court, he argued interpretation of Constitutional texts, while I, in state killing chambers, accompanied real human beings -- six of them -- to their deaths, which were a direct result of Scalia's interpretations.\n\nIn grasping the \"meaning\" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.\n\nOne thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his \"originalist\" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.\n\nAfter all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives?

Hide Caption 13 of 13\n\nI have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.\n\nAs for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.\n\nGiven what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.\n\nIn 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.\n\nI say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in\"The Death of Innocents,\" taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.\n\nThree years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented . In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on \"cruel and unusual punishments.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes 02:04\n\nIn his dissent , Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of \"idiot\" as \"such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is.\" According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's \"idiot\" test.\n\nMy second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.\n\nThese stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by \"modern trends,\" as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.\n\nPhotos: Women of death row Kelly Renee Gissendaner was executed by lethal injection on Tuesday, September 29.

Hide Caption 59 of 59\n\nThus, Scalia could not brook American bishops' increasing opposition to the death penalty, nor the opposition of Popes John Paul II and Francis -- especially Pope Francis, who must have disturbed the justice considerably in his bold appeal before Congress for global abolition of the death penalty.\n\nAt a conference in Chicago in 2002, Scalia's statements about Christian faith vis a vis the death penalty stunned me. Statements such as these:\n\n-- \"It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States.\"\n\n-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, \"The powers that be are ordained of God,\" to mean: \"Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy.\"\n\nDemocracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.\n\nWhere was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking \"an eye for an eye,\" to pray for and forgive our enemies?\n\nIn Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.\n\nIn this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem \"enemy.\"\n\nIt seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.\n\nI also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom \"equal justice under law\" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.",

    "text": "Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin made his fortune in the country's real estate market -- and now he's warning that it's spiraling out of control.\n\nIt's the \"biggest bubble in history,\" he told CNNMoney in an exclusive interview Wednesday.\n\nBubble is a sensitive word in China after the dramatic rise and spectacular crash in the country's stock market last year, which wiped out the savings of millions of small investors who thought Beijing wouldn't allow the market to drop.\n\nAfter struggling to contain the fallout from the stock market debacle, China's leaders could face a similar headache in the real estate sector.\n\nRelated: IMF tells China to fix its debt problem now\n\nThe big problem, according to Wang, is that prices keep rising in major Chinese metropolises like Shanghai but are falling in thousands of smaller cities where huge numbers of properties lie empty.\n\n\"I don't see a good solution to this problem,\" he said. \"The government has come up with all sorts of measures -- limiting purchase or credit -- but none have worked.\"\n\nIt's a serious worry in China, where the economy is slowing at the same time as high debt levels continue to increase rapidly. There are massive sums at stake in the real estate market: direct loans to the sector stood at roughly 24 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) at the end of June, according to Capital Economics.\n\nRelated: This Chinese province has produced the second most billionaires in the world\n\n\"The problem is the economy hasn't bottomed out,\" Wang said. \"If we remove leverage too fast, the economy may suffer further. So we'll have to wait until the economy is back on the track of rebounding -- that's when we gradually reduce leverage and debts.\"\n\nHe says, though, that he's not worried about the prospect of a \"hard landing\" -- a sudden and catastrophic collapse in economic growth.\n\nWang's comments carry weight. He is the richest man in China, according to Forbes and Hurun Report data from 2015, and his real estate and entertainment empire brought in revenue of about $44 billion last year.\n\nWang has been warning of trouble in the Chinese property market for a while. His Dalian Wanda Group, which has developed huge malls and office complexes across China, has been gradually cutting back on its real estate business.\n\nRelated: Billionaire vows to crush Disney in China\n\nInstead, it's pouring resources into entertainment, sports and tourism -- areas where it sees potential for growth.\n\nWang has been on an overseas shopping spree lately, with a particular focus on the U.S. movie industry. And he's on the hunt for more juicy targets.\n\nIn January, he bought the Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment, which made blockbuster movies like \"Jurassic World\" and \"Godzilla.\" Less than two months later, his movie theater business AMC snapped up Carmike Cinemas, forming the biggest cinema chain in the world. And Wanda's in talks to buy Dick Clark Productions, which produces shows like the American Music Awards and the Golden Globe awards.\n\nBut the major prize he's seeking is control of one of Hollywood's \"Big Six\" movie studios: 20th Century Fox, Columbia, Paramount, Universal Pictures, Warner Brothers and Walt Disney.\n\nRelated: Disney CEO says China is tough but a 'great opportunity'\n\n\"We are waiting for the opportunity,\" he said. \"It could come in a year or two, or longer, but we have patience.\"\n\nHis relations with Disney (DIS) came into the spotlight in May when he said the U.S. company \"really shouldn't have come to China\" with its giant new Shanghai resort. Wanda is also investing heavily in theme parks in the country.\n\nWang said Wednesday that his beef with the House of Mouse was \"not personal.\"\n\n\"When it comes to movies, Disney is our biggest partner,\" he said. \"But when it comes to entertainment tourism, we are archrivals. So of course we want to smash them.\"\n\n-- Steven Jiang contributed to this report.",

    "text": "We can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner . We can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out. After the Times ran a column giving employers tips on how to deal with Millennials (for example, they need regular naps) (I didn't read the article; that's from my experience), Slate's Amanda Hess pointed out that the examples the Times used to demonstrate their points weren't actually Millennials. Some of the people quoted in the article were as old as 37, which was considered elderly only 5,000 short years ago. The age of employees of The Wire, the humble website you are currently reading, varies widely, meaning that we too have in the past wondered where the boundaries for the various generations were drawn. Is a 37-year-old who gets text-message condolences from her friends a Millennial by virtue of her behavior? Or is she some other generation, because she was born super long ago? (Sorry, 37-year-old Rebecca Soffer who is a friend of a friend of mine and who I met once! You're not actually that old!) Since The Wire is committed to Broadening Human Understanding\u2122, I decided to find out where generational boundaries are drawn.\n\nI started by calling the Census Bureau. A representative called me back, without much information. \"We do not define the different generations,\" she told me. \"The only generation we do define is Baby Boomers and that year bracket is from 1946 to 1964.\" Next, I spoke with Tom DiPrete, a sociology professor at Columbia University. And he agreed with the Census Bureau. \"I think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media,\" DiPrete said, \"and the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation.\" DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation. It \"had specific characteristics,\" and occurred within an observable timeframe. World War II ended. You had the post-war rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family. Then societal changes disrupted those patterns, and the generation, for academic purposes, was over. His main point: \"History isn't always so punctuated.\" I understood why Generation X, a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty, would be poorly defined. But what about Millennials? Doesn't their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers? \"I actually haven't seen efforts to document [generations] rigorously, and I would be somewhat skeptical that they can be documented rigorously.\" DiPrete said. The things that have shaped Millennials \u2014 the rise of technology and social networks, for example \u2014 \"affect people's lives differently.\"",

    "text": "Craig Bryan is a board-certified clinical psychologist and Executive Director of the National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah. He deployed to Iraq in 2009, and separated from military service soon after his return. He currently researches suicidal behaviors and suicide prevention strategies, and is a national expert on military and veteran suicide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) During a recent interview at the Retired American Warriors PAC, Donald Trump suggested that military personnel and veterans struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide because they are not strong enough to \"handle\" the horrors of war.\n\nThese statements perpetuate several myths about military and veteran mental health that are dangerous because they are contradicted by considerable scientific evidence as well as the experiences of service members and veterans who have grappled with psychological injury.\n\nThe comments by the Republican presidential nominee imply that military suicide is largely a problem associated with deployments and combat exposure. This perspective is common among many Americans and it may seem intuitive, but it has repeatedly failed to gain scientific backing.\n\nAs early as 2008, publicly available military data indicated that service members who deployed were not more likely to die by suicide, and fewer than 1 in 6 service members who died by suicide had experienced direct combat\n\nYear after year, this pattern has remained largely unchanged. Several broad and carefully designed studies conducted during the past few years have similarly failed to find a correlation of deployment history with suicide among military personnel, even after they had left military service\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama signs veteran suicide prevention bill Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama signs veteran suicide prevention bill 02:57\n\nYes, some service members and veterans who die by suicide have been deployed, and some of them have experienced \"horror stories.\" But this truth does not negate another important truth about military suicide: More than 80% of service members who die by suicide have never been in combat.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPublic figures who continue to perpetuate this storyline are barking up the wrong tree and distracting us from realizing answers that could save lives. We must acknowledge what the data have been telling us for years: Suicide is an issue that is related to far more than deployment.\n\nesearch But by far the more troubling implication of Trump's comments is that PTSD and suicide are signs of weakness. This perspective is incredibly dangerous and harmful to veterans. Multiple studies have disproven this myth, showing that people who think about and attempt suicide can actually tolerate higher levels of emotional and physical pain than non-suicidal individuals.\n\nJUST WATCHED Biden slams Trump's 'profound ignorance' of PTSD Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden slams Trump's 'profound ignorance' of PTSD 01:48\n\nOn the surface, this may not appear to make sense. Shouldn't individuals who can \"handle it\" the best be the least likely to consider or attempt suicide? Without a doubt, high distress-tolerance has many rewards, of which one is the capacity to endure despite considerable pain and discomfort.\n\nThe downside is that such individuals can appear (and feel) okay despite experiencing extreme internal turmoil. These veterans are less likely to ask for help and, because they seem to be doing okay, we are less likely to check in with them or offer assistance.\n\nTrump's comments do little to help the work of those trying to save our friends, family members, and loved ones in need. Accumulating evidence shows that certain types of cognitive behavioral therapies can lead to rapid recovery from PTSD among military personnel and veterans.\n\nPhotos: Obama holds town hall at military base Photos: Obama holds town hall at military base U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during a town-hall event in Fort Lee, Virginia, on Wednesday, September 28.

They die by suicide because they have endured much more pain and suffering than most of us have ever experienced. These veterans deserve compassion and support, not disparagement.",

    "text": "(CNN) As children, the Berisha brothers would imagine which of the world's biggest football clubs they would play for, and bring their dreams to life on the school playground.\n\nLittle did they know then that, as adults, they would sit together deep in thought, pondering which nation they would represent.\n\nThe son of Kosovar-Albanian immigrants, but born in Sweden, Valon Berisha had already established himself as a regular in Norway's national team, representing the country where he grew up.\n\nBy the time Kosovo's dream of playing for a place in the World Cup was realized in May 2016, his younger brother Veton had also broken into the Norway senior squad.\n\nShould they stick? Or should they twist? For Valon, 23, and Veton, 22, it was one of the most difficult decisions they had ever faced.\n\nValon Berisha played 20 games for Norway before deciding to move to the Kosovo national team.\n\nDecision time\n\n\"This was huge -- not only for us but for our family,\" Valon told CNN. \"It wasn't just about our careers but about what was best for everyone, because we both played for Norway.\"\n\nThe brothers sat and talked it out. Valon was not just a bit-part player for Norway, the midfielder had won 20 international caps.\n\nHe had grown up playing his football in Norway, moving through each age group at international level.\n\nBoth men felt a sense of debt and gratitude towards a country that had taken their family in from the horrors of war.\n\nValon, who has played in Austria with Red Bull Salzburg since 2012, had long been admired by scouts in Norway and abroad.\n\nHe recalls rejecting a contract from Manchester City as he felt too young to leave his family behind, while there was also reported interest from Chelsea, another leading English club.\n\nVeton Berisha plays in Germany with Greuther Furth.\n\nVeton, a forward with German second division side Greuther Furth, went down the same path, winning caps at every junior level before graduating to full international honors.\n\nIn the end, the brothers did what they thought was best -- they gave back to both countries.\n\n\"It was hard,\" Valon said. \"I am and always will be hugely grateful to Norway -- it's the country which I grew up in and helped me.\n\n\"But I feel a connection to Kosovo. So we decided that I would go to play for Kosovo and he would stay with Norway.\n\n\"Veton is staying to help the country we grew up in, and I wanted to help a young country make its way.\"\n\nKosovo was forced to come from behind to secure a draw in Finland.\n\nTough times\n\nValon says his connection to Kosovo, where some of his family still resides, is overwhelming.\n\nHe goes back twice a year, and gets plenty of attention.\n\nWonderful scenes as the players hug and congratulate each other. A scrum of #Kosovo & Finnish media around them... pic.twitter.com/XZodcPh3ug \u2014 James Montague (@JamesPiotr) September 5, 2016\n\n\"When I'm there I get recognized,\" he said. \"The people love football, and I love being there.\n\n\"For Kosovo to have a national team is so important. It is a developing country where circumstances are improving and people are getting better jobs.\"\n\nAccording to the most recent figures published by the Statistics Agency of Kosovo in 2015, its unemployment rate is 35.1%.\n\nKosovo fans were out in force for the 1-1 draw in Finland last month.\n\nThat figure increases markedly when looking at the 15-24 age group, where unemployment is 60.2%.\n\n\"The people in Kosovo don't have the best way of life,\" Valon acknowledges. \"I wanted to help the country to do something special.\"\n\nWaiting game\n\nValon had a nervous wait before football's world governing body FIFA ratified his switch to Kosovo.\n\nBy the time its first World Cup qualifier came around last month, six players waiting for their transfers to be confirmed had yet to hear from the authorities.\n\nValon Berisha plays for Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg.\n\nWith kickoff in Turku, Finland, just hours away, his fate had yet to be sealed.\n\n\"I was overcome with nerves,\" he said. \"I was just sitting there and waiting. The five others got their confirmation but I was still waiting.\n\n\"I must have sat for four or five hours until finally I was cleared. That was the moment -- it was huge, not just for me but for my whole family and everyone I know.\"\n\nHome from home\n\nThe Berisha family moved to Norway in 1993, having left home due to the Balkans war.\n\nTheir plight is not unusual in the world of football -- the Xhaka brothers, Granit and Taulant, play for Switzerland and Albania respectively, and faced each other at Euro 2016.\n\nSeveral other footballers with Kosovan heritage -- such as English Premier League stars Xherdan Shaqiri and Valon Behrami, who play for Switzerland -- have represented other nations because Kosovo was not an option on the international stage.\n\nSwitzerland's Granit Xhaka faced his brother Taulant -- who represents Albania -- at the Euro 2016 finals.\n\nIt was not until May 2016, when Kosovo was granted FIFA status, that players representing other countries could make a serious decision over whether to switch to the Balkan state.\n\nGoalkeeper Samir Ujkani also made the transition along with fellow Albania internationals Amir Rrahmani, Albert Meha, Herolind Shala and Milot Rashica.\n\nThrown together at the last possible moment, Kosovo claimed a historic 1-1 draw in Finland on September 5 -- Valon Berisha scored his side's goal from the penalty spot.\n\nValon Berisha scored Kosovo's first goal in World Cup qualification, in the 1-1 draw with Finland.\n\n\"That was an amazing moment,\" he said. \"When we got the penalty I didn't know who was going to take it.\n\n\"But once I had the ball, I knew I was going to score. When it went in ... well ... what a moment. I'll never forget it.\"\n\nTime to shine\n\nKosovo fans watch the Albania-Serbia Euro 2016 qualifier on a big screen in Pristina.\n\nOn Thursday, Kosovo will play its first World Cup qualifier on \"home\" soil -- or rather Albanian soil, with renovations on the national stadium in Pristina still being completed.\n\nThousands of fans are set to make the short trip to Shkoder for the game with Croatia, a team which emerged from Balkans war as one of the most talented in Europe.\n\nFor Valon, and the entire Berisha family, it is a moment they had never dared to dream of.\n\nCroatia boasts a handful of star players including Ivan Perisic and Ivan Rakitic.\n\n\"I am so excited -- we know it's going to be a difficult game but this is something we never thought would be possible,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, we thought it might happen, that it might take a while -- but it's here.\n\n\"We will have the whole country supporting us and we want to give something back. We have just started out our journey -- but we want to get something out of it.\"",

    "text": "Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday at a female lawyer whom he had called \"disgusting\" several years ago for requesting a break to pump breast milk in the middle of a deposition, calling her a \"vicious, horrible person.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, the Republican presidential candidate claimed that the attorney, Elizabeth Beck, had wanted to pump breast milk in other people's presence. Trump alleged that Beck was now retaliating against him because she was unhappy about having lost that legal battle, and that she had fabricated a story about Trump losing his cool and storming out of the deposition room.\n\n\"She wanted to breast pump in front of me and I may have said that's disgusting, I may have said something else. I thought it was terrible,\" Trump said. \"She's a vicious, horrible person.\"\n\nElizabeth Beck described the 2011 encounter - first reported by the New York Times late Tuesday - as Trump having \"an absolute meltdown\" in an interview with CNN's \"New Day\" Wednesday morning.\n\n\"He got up, his face got red, he shook his finger at me and he screamed, 'You're disgusting, you're disgusting,' and he ran out of there,\" Beck said.\n\nTrump strongly refuted this characterization in Wednesday's interview, saying Beck had distorted the events.\n\n\"She made it up. She made it up,\" he said. \"She's saying, 'Oh, he was so violent and he was so, so wild and she was afraid.' She was afraid of nobody. She's a tough killer in Miami everyone knows she's a killer. They all hate her.\"\n\nWell-known for his colorful language and imagery, Trump went on to compare Beck's interview with CNN earlier in the day to the way people who had never met Michael Jackson discussed the iconic pop star after his death.\n\n\"So many people are on television that don't know me and they're like experts on me,\" Trump said. \"You know when Michael Jackson died - I knew him very well - and everybody was talking about Michael Jackson. They didn't know him, they knew nothing. Some of them never even met him.\"\n\nPressed on how the 2011 incident reflects on how Trump would behave as president - and how he would react if challenged by a world leader like Russian President Vladmir Putin - Trump answered: \"Believe me, I'd do very well with him. I get along with people.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) A narrow win for Colombia's opponents to a government peace deal with FARC rebels has thrown the country into disarray, leading one journalist to starkly declare, \"Nobody really knows what will happen tomorrow.\"\n\nLikened to the fallout from the United Kingdom's \"Brexit\" referendum, the vote's unexpected failure has left the Colombian political classes reeling and unsure how to respond in order to save four years of hard negotiation with the Marxist militia.\n\nAnd while a meeting of the deal's principals is scheduled for Monday morning, FARC's financial disclosures -- and possibly a disarmament campaign that began last week-- have been questioned.\n\nWhy did they reject it?\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Sunday's vote, many Colombians were angered by what they saw as insufficient punishment for those who perpetrated a litany of crimes against their people.\n\nIt's estimated 220,000 were killed in the 52-year conflict which displaced as many as 5 million people.\n\nAt the height of its terror campaign, the armed group seized territory, attacked government forces and conducted high-profile kidnappings. The rebels also hijacked planes, made millions trafficking cocaine and forced children to fight.\n\nFor just over half of those who voted, the FARC's past crimes were too much to forgive.\n\nWas there a plan B?\n\nThe rejection of the plan has left the administration of President Juan Manuel Santos wrongfooted and, as the president himself said, \"without a plan B.\"\n\nI will not give up, I will continue to fight for peace. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos\n\nNow the rebels and the Colombian government, facilitated by international leaders, will have to go back to the drawing board to re-imagine a peace that is acceptable to the people of Colombia, speaking on behalf of the victims of murder, extortion and kidnapping.\n\n\"I hear those that said 'no' and those that said 'yes' and we all want peace. Tomorrow we will get all our political parties together to continue dialogues and finding alternatives for peace. I will not give up, I will continue to fight for peace,\" Santos said.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nIt is largely unclear what the path forward looks like. Santos said Sunday a ceasefire will remain in place and negotiations will continue in Havana, Cuba, while his counterpart, FARC leader Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, agreed that the referendum result would not sway the former rebels from the path of peace.\n\n\"With today's result, we know that our challenge as a political movement is even greater and demands for us to be stronger, to build up a durable and stable peace,\" Londo\u00f1o, who also goes by the alias Timole\u00f3n \"Timochenko\" Jim\u00e9nez, said Sunday night.\n\n\"The FARC-EP maintains the willingness for peace and they reaffirm their disposition to use only the word as a constructive weapon towards the future. To the Colombian people who dream with peace, they can count on us. Peace will triumph.\"\n\nThe pen used to sign the peace accords with the FARC was made from recycled bullets once used in combat.\n\nCan a new deal be agreed?\n\nThe country is divided, says Virginia Bouvier, Senior Advisor for Latin American Programs at the US Institute of Peace, and while the accord represented a \"unique and very exciting endeavor to hold accountable those who have committed horrific crimes,\" opponents of the deal reduced it to an oversimplified outcome: whether former rebels would see the inside of a jail cell.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, \"the path of peace will continue and both sides will follow it,\" Bouvier told CNN via Skype.\n\n\"Santos... speaking as president of all those who voted, said that he recognized that he had put it to a vote but maintained that he would be convening all political sectors to enter in dialogue and take that back to Havana.\n\n\"Trying to implement something that half of the population is against it is very difficult,\" she said, adding that in Colombia today there are deep divisions and the country polarized.\n\n\"I think this gives an option to go back to the drawing board to tweak to see what works for the entire population. I wish the (dealmakers) tremendous stamina for the next stage,\" she said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Colombia signs peace agreement with the FARC Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Colombia signs peace agreement with the FARC 02:39\n\nWill there be political repercussions?\n\nAlmost without doubt. The 'no' vote was seen as somewhat of a referendum on Santos, who lost support through his agreement to sit down with the rebels.\n\nThe 'no' campaign was led by his predecessor, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, who would like to run again as president.\n\n\"This is a huge blow to the political future of President Santos,\" Journalist Simone Bruno told CNN.\n\n\"Just a few days ago we saw him signing this important agreement with the FARC leader and had huge support from the international community.\n\n\"He was one of the main candidates for the Nobel Prize and now he has to go back again. What he said is that he will never lose the chance to negotiate until the last day of his mandate. Now he wants to keep on going, keep on negotiating but of course of things are changing and nobody really knows what will happen tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat could a new deal look like?\n\nIt's unlikely that the FARC leadership would give up former rebels to jail time to satisfy the demands of the slim majority which rejected the deal. FARC members and supporters already feel that the group has conceded too much in its quest for a settlement.\n\nSantos has called a meeting of the principals of the imperiled deal for Monday morning in Bogota to decide what step to next take. One thing is for sure; no one wants a return to all-out conflict between government troops and a dwindling band of rebels in Colombia's jungles.\n\nAs so little is known about what comes next, it is unclear if the process to get the derailed deal back on track will happen quickly or slowly. The president still holds a majority in congress and will do so for the two remaining years of his term, so while the vote result is politically damaging he still has a lot of sway in congress.\n\nIt is unlikely that the whole deal will be scrapped, but rather the contentious clause which keeps former rebels out of jail will be renegotiated.",

    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) - Ryan Grassley had to pay nearly $40 to hold his baby immediately after the child was born via cesarean section.\n\nThe Spanish Fork, Utah father only wanted to share the laugh he and his wife got out of seeing the itemized bill with a $39.35 charge for skin-to-skin time. The practice, viewed to have many benefits, is when a baby\u2019s bare skin is placed against its mother\u2019s to help them bond.\n\nGrassley said on Sept. 4 his son was born at Utah Valley Hospital and the operating room nurse asked if the couple wanted to do skin-to-skin. The baby was cleaned up after the C-section and ready for his moment with mommy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe nurse let me hold the baby on my wife's neck/chest,\u201d Grassley, a.k.a. Reddit user halfthrottle, posted. \u201cEven borrowed my camera to take a few pictures for us. Everyone involved in the process was great, and we had a positive experience. We just got a chuckle out of seeing that on the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI posted the bill to Reddit because I thought it was funny,\u201d Grassley wrote online.\n\n\n\nApparently, 3.1 million people agreed with him. The post has been viewed more than 3.1 million times on Imgur.com, as of Tuesday at 5 p.m., and upvoted more than 6,200 times on Reddit.\n\nGrassley wrote on his GoFundMe page it has been interesting to see the shock from people around the world about the cost of medical procedures in the U.S.\n\nYes, you read that right. Grassley has set up a tongue-in-cheek GoFundMe account with a fundraising goal of $39.35 to pay off the \u201cridiculous\u201d fee. He writes any excess money donated will be put toward a vasectomy because, \u201cI never want to go through these sleepless new baby nights again.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Ryan reached his fundraising goal overnight! As of Wednesday morning, more than $50 have been raised on his GoFundMe page. He's well on his way to a sterile future.\n\nGrassley wanted to be clear that he wasn't posting the picture of the bill as a slight toward the hospital.\n\n\n\n\"We had a very positive experience during the birth of our son, and the hospital and staff were great throughout the entire process,\" he wrote.\n\nYes, the photo of the bill is real, and it\u2019s an actual fee with a reasoning behind it.\n\nJanet Frank, a spokeswoman for Intermountain HealthCare\u2019s Utah Valley Hospital, wrote this in a statement:\n\n\u201cIn general, Utah Valley Hospital is an advocate for skin-to-skin contact between a mother and newborn directly after birth. Skin-to-skin is a best practice with proven benefits for both mom and baby. We do everything possible to allow skin-to-skin after both vaginal and C-section births. In the case of a C-section, where the bedside caregiver is occupied caring for the mother during surgery, an additional nurse is brought into the OR to allow the infant to remain in the OR suite with the mother. This is to ensure both patients remain safe. There is an additional charge associated with bringing an extra caregiver into the OR. The charge is not for holding the baby, but for the additional caregiver needed to maintain the highest levels of patient safety.\u201d\n\nFrank was unable to comment specifically on the Grassleys' situation due to patient privacy laws.",

The currency also gave up ground against the euro.\n\n\"May seems to lean towards a so called 'hard Brexit,' pointing out that the U.K. would not take back its sovereignty just to 'give it all up again,' \" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.\n\nThe U.K. economy has proved more resilient than expected in the wake of the EU referendum, but a sharp fall in the value of the pound and a big injection of money from the Bank of England have helped limit the fallout.\n\nLosing full access to Europe's markets, the world's largest, could hurt growth. London's financial services sector would be particularly at risk if its banks lost the ability to do business freely across the continent. Automakers are worried about the possibility of tariffs.\n\nRelated: 100 days after Brexit vote: No meltdown (yet)\n\nU.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond acknowledged Monday that the British economy would pay a price for Brexit.\n\nHe confirmed that a target to balance the budget by 2020 set by his predecessor would have to be abandoned -- a consequence of Brexit that will add to Britain's \u00a31 trillion-plus debt.\n\n\"Self-inflicted dislocations with its major market -- when the U.K. already carries a high level of public debt, a large current account deficit and severe imbalances across major sectors -- are unwise, to put it mildly,\" Schmieding said.",

    "text": "Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) There's something different about the way the world is mourning the death of former Israeli President Shimon Peres .\n\nWhat we're hearing is not simply the usual goodbyes to a man with a longstanding high profile on the global stage. No, this time there seems to be something else going on. Grief is being expressed not just for Peres, but for what he represented.\n\nSimply put, there seems to be a sadness, tinged with fear, that what Shimon Peres stood for may die with him.\n\nIf you want to understand what Peres embodied, it helps to know what an uncommon, seemingly contradictory person he was: a practical dreamer, a realistic visionary, a hawk-turned-dove, a man who believed in strength as a means to peace, and someone who worked until the very end of his life to achieve his goal of bringing peace to the Middle East.\n\nThis is not a view embraced by everyone. There are many Arabs, in particular, who view his legacy as grievously dark and negative. They look at his early support for Israeli settlements ( although he was later critical of them ) and his pivotal role in building Israel's military. Perhaps more than anything, they recall some of the most controversial actions of the Israeli Defense Forces under his government.\n\nBut the larger reality -- and the reason why so many world leaders, including President Barack Obama , are attending his funeral on Friday -- is that Shimon Peres came to personify the most scarce of all qualities in the Middle East: optimism about the prospects for reconciliation and a relentless determination to make it happen.\n\nPeres often spoke of his most cherished goal like a man convinced he can see the future. \"The Palestinians are our closest neighbors,\" he reportedly declared , \"I am sure they can become our closest friends.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Herzog: Shimon Peres was a giant who dreamed of peace Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Herzog: Shimon Peres was a giant who dreamed of peace 03:38\n\nOne man who knew him well, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, tweeted \"Shimon Peres' death is a heavy loss for all humanity and for peace in the region.\" Haaretz reported that Abbas called him a partner in making \"the peace of the brave.\"\n\nThe peace of the brave was shorthand for the Oslo Accords signed on the White House lawn in 1993, which earned a Nobel Peace Prize for Peres, along with then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The reconciliation that was supposed to follow never quite materialized. But Peres never gave up trying to make it happen.\n\nWorld leaders are traveling to Israel for his funeral on Friday. Their presence in Jerusalem is partly about paying their respects, but perhaps also meant to convey their wish that the vision outlive the visionary. Certainly, it is a way of telling the world, of telling Israelis and Palestinians, to not give up on peace.\n\nPresident Obama wrote , \"There are few people who we share this world with who change the course of human history ... they expand our moral imagination and force us to expect more of ourselves. My friend Shimon was one of those people.\" Obama's statement revealed the hope of the trip. \"A light has gone out,\" it said, \"but the hope he gave us will burn forever.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED A look back at the life of Shimon Peres Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A look back at the life of Shimon Peres 03:28\n\nOn Wednesday night, Obama paid another uncommon tribute to Peres. He issued a proclamation ordering that the U.S. flag fly at half-staff throughout the country to honor a man who had become something of a mentor to the American president.\n\nWe cannot know with certainty, but if Shimon Peres had been a more successful politician, if terrorist groups had not sabotaged his career, a key part of the Middle East might look quite different today.\n\nPeace between Israelis and Palestinians alone would not fix the Middle East. Syria, Iraq, Yemen -- so many of the region's trouble spots -- might still be aflame anyway. But that one feverish dispute, the one between Israelis and Palestinians, might just have come to an end.\n\nPeres' dreams were not only about diplomacy and state-building. He had a child-like fascination with technology and innovation, and saw it as intricately connected to a better future for Israel and its neighbors. His exotic notion of a \"Red-Dead Canal\" -- linking the Red Sea and the Dead Sea to create a zone of technology, trade and prosperity for Israelis, Jordanians, and Palestinians -- seemed like a science-fiction fantasy. (Although it may just happen as part of an even grander idea, the Valley of Peace ).\n\nPeres arrived in the British-ruled territory of Palestine in 1934, when he was an 11-year-old boy named Shimon Persky, fleeing antisemitism in what was then Poland, and worked to build the dream of rebuilding the modern Jewish state. As the state came under attack from its neighbors, he worked to turn Israel into a military powerhouse, complete with a nuclear program, arguing that peace would only come when Israel's enemies understood they could not destroy it.\n\nJUST WATCHED Amanpour remembers Shimon Peres Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Amanpour remembers Shimon Peres 02:38\n\nPeres was never elected prime minister, although in 1996 he came close, when he was running after a Jewish terrorist opposed to the Oslo peace assassinated Rabin. The polls showed Peres far ahead of his challenge r, Benjamin Netanyahu. But then the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas launched a series of bombings, blowing up city buses, restaurants, and shopping malls. The terrorists tilted the election to the security candidate , Netanyahu.\n\nYet despite his poor performance at the polls, he became a beloved national figure, serving as Israel's ceremonial president until 2014. When his term ended, he made a hilarious video as a former president looking for a new job.\n\nToday, with Israel's right now in control of the government, Peres the optimist might have been able to detect a silver lining in something that came after his death. Israel's Education Minister Naftali Bennett, a rightist, directed that all school children spend part of a school day learning about Peres.",

    "text": "(CNN) In sporting terms they are poles apart, but when it comes to winning horse races and football matches the ingredients for success are remarkably similar, according to Dermot Weld.\n\nThe Irish champion trainer can lay claim to at least a modicum of insight, given his close friendship with ex-Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson.\n\n\"I've known Sir Alex for a long time,\" Weld tells CNN from Rosewell House near the Curragh, Ireland's historic home of flat racing.\n\nDermot Weld is bidding to add Harzand to his 4,000-plus winners, and a first Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe win.\n\n\"We've had many discussions about the similarities of training racehorses and managing football teams, and no one's better at knowing their players than Sir Alex Ferguson.\"\n\nThe Scot might be famous for giving underperforming stars the \"hairdryer treatment\" on occasions, but he was also a master tactician routinely orchestrating match-winning performances during his 26-year reign at Old Trafford.\n\nFerguson, an avid horse racing fan, penned the foreword to Weld's 2009 autobiography \"Vintage Crop: Against All Odds,\" offering some sage advice that could be equally be applied to his own footballing philosophy.\n\n\"For me, he wrote about knowing your horses and knowing their weaknesses so that can become a strength,\" Weld explains. \"So it's not always the best horse that might win a race but the right horse for that race.\"\n\nFormer Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson has always been a keen student of horse racing.\n\nOn Sunday, Weld hopes his Fergie-esque Midas touch strikes once again with the Aga Khan-owned Harzand in the 95th running of the prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe\n\nIt would be the latest twist in a colorful life that has even seen him played by the Irish actor Brendan Gleeson in The Cup, Gleeson better known for playing Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody in the Harry Potter franchise among others.\n\nMuch like Ferguson, who won 13 Premier League titles, two Champions League crowns and 38 trophies in total at United, Weld is no stranger to silverware having trained more than 4,000 horses already during an illustrious career that shows few signs of diminishing.\n\nJUST WATCHED Winning the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Winning the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe 02:54\n\nTrailblazing trainer\n\nThe 68-year-old has won virtually every Irish race of repute -- some many times over, including the Irish Derby (three wins) and the Irish St Leger (seven). But it is arguably his victories on foreign shores that make him stand out.\n\nWeld is a liker of firsts, a trainer keen on being a trailblazer for his sport. He raced in Asia long before such a move was fashionable, winning the inaugural Hong Kong Mile with Additional Risk in 1991.\n\nHe did the same with the Melbourne Cup, becoming the first foreign trainer to win the \"race that stops a nation\" in 1993 with Vintage Crop when critics said it was impossible.\n\nIreland's Curragh racecourse is home to a statue of 1993 Melbourne Cup winner Vintage Crop, trained by Weld.\n\nHe is also the first and still only European trainer to win the Belmont Stakes, part one of the Triple Crown in the United States, a feat he achieved with Go and Go in 1990.\n\nWeld has won with every horse imaginable from sprinters to stayers, and unlike many of his peers in flat racing has also enjoyed a myriad of winners over the fences too. There can be few, if any, more versatile trainers currently in the business across the globe.\n\nThe Arc is one of the few major racing scalps to have eluded him yet but, in Harzand, he has a golden opportunity to break his duck.\n\n\"You always dream to have a horse good enough to win the Arc,\" he says of Europe's richest horse race, with a purse of $5.6 million.\n\nAlready a groundbreaking first has been ticked off this season with a maiden victory at the UK's Epsom Derby with the Pat Smullen-ridden Harzand, which is bidding to emulate the feat of Golden Horn in sealing the Derby-Arc double in one season just 12 months ago.\n\nBut the build-up has not been without its issues, the horse suffering a V-shaped cut during the Irish Champion Stakes earlier this month but Weld is confident he has recovered in time to race well at Chantilly racecourse -- the Arc's traditional home at Longchamp, Paris is currently undergoing refurbishment.\n\nJUST WATCHED The paintballing jockey Replay More Videos ...

Long before he was training horses he qualified as a vet, remarkably combining his studies with being crowned the leading amateur jockey in Ireland on three occasions.\n\n\"I was always interested in equine surgery,\" he explains. \"That's what I would have gone into. Doing the riding and the course wasn't easy. I had a great friend who'd go to the lectures, pass on the notes and then often drive me to the race meetings. Then I'd study until midnight that night.\"\n\nHe had brief stints working in the US and Australia, where his conjoined interests in the Triple Crown races and the Melbourne Cup were born before working under his father Charlie, himself an established trainer.\n\nJUST WATCHED Australia's golden horse racing heritage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Australia's golden horse racing heritage 02:27\n\nWhat followed was Weld becoming arguably the most global trainer in the business starting with Hong Kong.\n\n\"There was Hong Kong and then the Belmont,\" he says, \"which is funny as I'm looking at a picture of Go and Go [the Belmont winner he trained] right now. I trained grade 1 winners across the States, and then I looked to Australia.\n\n\"People told me I was mad and it was impossible,\" and so it proved on his first time of asking, quarantine and travel rules making the trip too complex in 1992 before he made it work the following year and traveled to Melbourne with Vintage Crop.\n\n\"I wanted to bring a horse 12,000 miles across the world and prove the world wrong,\" he recalls of the decision. \"We went and won, and everything's changed since then. Nine years later I went back to prove it wasn't a fluke and won again.\"\n\nDermot Weld and jockey Damien Oliver celebrate their 2002 Melbourne Cup victory.\n\nThe story of Media Puzzle, the 2002 winner, is the one that got the movie treatment, telling the story of Damien Oliver's win on board and the previous tragic deaths of his jockey father and brother Jason, who lost his life just two weeks before the Melbourne Cup.\n\nFor Weld, it was an emotive race while the movie-making process some years later proved a fun experience.\n\n\"I had Brendan Gleeson follow me around for a couple of days which was fun,\" he says. \"And obviously he's a fabulous actor. Like any film, there was a bit of poetic license but overall I think they did very well.\"\n\nAugust 2016: Weld with the victorious Sharliyna after the Irish Stallion Farms European Breeders Fund Fillies Maiden at Dublin's Leopardstown Racecourse.\n\nDespite the drama of the win, he cannot pick it as a favorite. In fact, he finds it impossible to select a favorite win or favorite horse from over the years simply insisting that \"I never got bored of winning and I'm always hungry for the next win.\"\n\nIn football, there was Fergie time. Weld time has yet to become part of horse racing's lexicon but the Irishman would dearly like it to finally be his time in Paris on Sunday.",

    "text": "Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) It's taken more than 500 days and overcome countless problems, but the epic journey of Solar Impulse 2 is finally complete.\n\nThe experimental solar-powered plane made aviation history when it landed in Abu Dhabi before dawn on Tuesday, after successfully circumnavigating the globe without using a single drop of fuel.\n\nThe record-breaking mission flown by two Swiss pilots, Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, evoked memories of the likes of the Wright brothers and Amelia Earhart -- aviation pioneers with a similar spirit of adventure and innovation.\n\nBorschberg is an ex-fighter pilot and MIT engineering graduate, while Piccard -- who also made the first non-stop round-the-world balloon flight in 1999 -- comes from a long line of adventurers.\n\nHis grandfather, Auguste Piccard, was a physicist with a passion for record-breaking balloon flights, while his father, Jacques Piccard, was a renowned oceanographer and diver. In 1960, together with U.S. Navy diver Don Walsh, the duo became the first men to dive the seven miles (11 kilometers) to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific, the deepest part of the world's oceans.\n\nThe wing span of the Solar Impulse plane is wider than a Boeing 747 Jumbo\n\nThe journey by Solar Impulse 2, one of the project's two operational aircraft, was no less of a challenge.\n\nWith a wingspan greater than that of a Boeing 747 Jumbo jet, Solar Impulse is fitted with four electric engines powered by renewable energy from the sun.\n\nThe aircraft is covered with 17,248 solar panels, has on-board batteries that allow it to fly at night, and weighs about as much as an SUV.\n\nIt was Piccard who landed the aircraft on the last leg of the journey ; a flight from Cairo to the UAE that lasted more than 48 hours.\n\nBREAKING: we flew 40'000km without fuel. It's a first for energy, take it further! #futureisclean pic.twitter.com/JCvKTDBVZx \u2014 SOLAR IMPULSE (@solarimpulse) July 26, 2016\n\nHe climbed out of the cockpit after touching down and was immediately embraced by Borschberg as the two men realized the magnitude of their feat.\n\n\"I'm not exhausted. I'm so happy,\" Piccard told CNN after the flight.\n\nBertrand Piccard inside his cockpit\n\n\"You know, with Andre, we have worked for 15 years in that project to make it happen. Finally, after all the doubts, all the problems, all the setbacks, we're successful. It's not the moment to be tired,\" he said.\n\n\"When I saw him coming on the same runway, in the same direction that I took off 15 months ago -- and you have time because this is an airplane that flies slowly -- you have time to enjoy that,\" said Borschberg. \"This was two fantastic minutes. I wanted them to last hours. I was thrilled by this. It was extraordinary,\" he added.\n\nRecords smashed\n\nSolar Impulse 2 began its epic round-the-world journey in March, 2015.\n\nPiccard and Borschberg took turns flying the single-seater aircraft on different legs of the route, and they were in a cockpit not much bigger than that of a Formula One race car.\n\nThey had to fly, sleep for 20 minutes at a time, eat and relieve themselves in their seat. \"It was a house in the sky,\" Piccard told CNN while flying over Saudi Arabia\n\nThey hopscotched across the globe, flying west to east from Abu Dhabi. They made planned landings in countries including Oman, India, China and the U.S., covering an estimated 24,800 miles (40,000 kilometers).\n\nFlying the first solar-powered plane around the world wasn't the only record the two men set.\n\nIn a flight that lasted more than 117 hours, Borschberg also made the world's longest solo flight during a five-day, five-night crossing of the vast Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt was a moment of human achievement: for almost five days and five nights Borschberg piloted the plane wearing an oxygen mask as it climbed 8,000 meters high (five miles) during the day, so the aircraft's solar cells could soak up enough energy to propel it through the night.\n\nBad weather, burned batteries\n\nJUST WATCHED Solar Impulse 2 makes history over Pacific Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Solar Impulse 2 makes history over Pacific 01:49\n\nIt was far from easy -- or quick.\n\nSolar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 75 kilometers (46 miles) per hour, slower than an ordinary passenger car.\n\nThe pilots encountered several setbacks and challenges along the way. A series of frustrating weather delays in China slowed progress for weeks, followed by an unexpected diversion to Japan where the aircraft was damaged on the tarmac by a storm.\n\nAnd the record-breaking Pacific Ocean crossing came at a cost. The plane's batteries overheated so badly that the trip had to be delayed in Hawaii by 10 months.\n\nSolar Impulse 2 above the Statue of Liberty\n\nIt was only after he landed that the team discovered how bad the damage was.\n\n\"We made a mistake with our batteries,\" Piccard said after the plane touched down in July last year. \"It was a human mistake.\"\n\nIt was a mistake that took more than nine months to fix, but fix it they did. A new cooling system for the batteries that could be manually operated by the pilot was installed, and the mission benefited from a further $20 million injection in funding to continue.\n\nViable alternative?\n\nPiccard came up with the idea for the Solar Impulse mission in 2002 and collaborated with Borschberg the following year. Their goal: to prove to the world that renewable energy is a viable alternative to fossil fuels -- even in the skies.\n\nSolar Impulse hits Saudi Arabia -- the blades on its propellers are powered by solar cells\n\nOver the course of the next decade, they built and tested several prototypes of their current plane powered by the sun.\n\nThe Solar Impulse project, which cost $170 million in total, was funded mostly by private sponsors.\n\nBy 2012, the two men had successfully completed a solar-powered flight across the continental United States, which is when they realized their latest round-the-world journey was possible.\n\nHowever, it may be some time before solar-powered flights take off commercially.\n\nThe Solar Impulse 2 was built with extremely lightweight carbon fiber material, which means it only has enough lift to carry one person.\n\nPhotos: Solar Impulse 2's round-the-world journey Solar Impulse 2, seen above the Pyramids of Giza on its approach to Cairo, Egypt.

Always eaten at lunchtime.\n\nWhere to try? La Matandeta near Albufera, Valencia\n\nLa Matandeta, Carretera, 46910 Alfafar Spain;\n\nPatatas bravas\n\nA staple among the small dishes that make up a classic tapas menu, patatas bravas -- \"brave potatoes\" -- is named for its spicy sauce, rare in a land that generally shuns fiery food.\n\nThe potatoes are cubed and shallow fried and served the same everywhere.\n\nThe sauce can come in any number of ways, from spicy ketchup to garlic mayonnaise with a dusting of pimiento (smoked paprika), or both.\n\nOne theory holds that the dirtier the bar, the better the bravas.\n\n\"Tapas originated in southern Spain and is an adaptation to the social culture of eating and drinking outside the home, and fulfills the same social function as the English public house and other similar institutions,\" explains Shawn Hennessey, who runs tapas tours of Seville\n\n\"It's important to note that the tapeo (tapas crawl) is not primarily a 'drinking culture' thing -- it's oriented to friends and family with a communal atmosphere.\n\n\"Intoxication and rowdiness are rare. Key factors are the social sharing of food, and the opportunity to try a lot of different things in one meal. In short, tapas are a way of life.\"\n\nWhere to try? La Taverna del Cl\u00ednic, Barcelona\n\nLa Taverna del Clinic, Rossello, 155, 08035 Barcelona Spain;\n\nGazpacho\n\nIs this the world's most famous cold soup?\n\nThis tomato-based Andalusian soup is most famous for being served cold.\n\nThis can be quite a shock for those who aren't expecting it, but in the searing heat of a Seville summer, the attraction becomes clear.\n\nIts principal ingredients, aside from tomato, are peppers, garlic, bread and lots of olive oil.\n\nWhere to try? Enrique Becerra, Seville\n\nEnrique Becerra, Gamazo, 2., 41001 Seville Spain;\n\nPimientos de Padron\n\nA common dish on tapas menus, pimientos de Padron are green peppers that hail originally from the town of that name in Galicia, in Spain's lush, rainy northwest.\n\nPimientos de Padron are fried and served with a deep sprinkling of salt.\n\nThough generally sweet and mild, their fame stems from the fact that the occasional pepper will be fiery hot -- lending a Russian Roulette element of surprise to eating them.\n\nWhere to try? Bierzo Enxebre, Santiago de Compostela\n\nBierzo Enxebre, Rua Troia 10, 15704, Santiago de Compostela Spain;\n\nFideu\u00e0\n\nLess well known to tourists, fideu\u00e0 is a type of Spanish pasta similar to vermicelli.\n\nIt's popular in Catalonia and Valencia in seafood dishes that rival paella for their taste and intricacy.\n\nFideu\u00e0 is typically cooked in a paella dish.\n\nWhere to try? El Rall, Valencia\n\nEl Rall, Calle Tundidores 2, 46001 Valencia Spain;\n\nJam\u00f3n\n\nPork perfection: Jamon Iberico from black pigs.\n\nJam\u00f3n, or cured ham, is the most celebrated Spanish food product.\n\nLegs of ham were traditionally salted and hung up to dry to preserve them through the long winter months.\n\nJam\u00f3n Serrano (of the mountain) is the most common kind and comes from white pigs; the more expensive Jam\u00f3n Iberico (pictured) comes from black pigs.\n\nThe best ham should be enjoyed in thin, melt-in-your-mouth slices on its own, with a little bread.\n\n\"Jam\u00f3n is the staple of the Spanish table,\" says chef Jos\u00e9 Pizarro , the brains behind the celebrated Jos\u00e9 tapas bar and Pizarro restaurant in London.\n\n\"We eat it before we eat; its salty, acorn-laden taste is the perfect accompaniment to sherry and Cava, and it gets your juices flowing for the meal that is yet to come.\n\n\"It's brilliantly good value and a leg can last ages as long as you cover and store it properly. Look for 'waxy' fat: when you rub it, it should melt into your skin like candlewax.\"\n\nWhere to try? Museo del Jam\u00f3n, Madrid\n\nMuseo del Jamon, Calle Gran Via 72, 28015 Madrid Spain;\n\nTortilla\n\nThe humble Spanish omelet can be made with chorizo, peppers and onions, among other ingredients, but purists will tell you it should only contain potatoes and eggs.\n\nThe potatoes are diced and lightly fried before being added to the egg mixture and fried on a high heat; the trickiest part is when you have to flip the pan over to turn the tortilla.\n\nIf you get it right, someone should shout \"Ol\u00e9!;\" get it wrong and you'll have gooey half-cooked tortilla everywhere.\n\nWhere to try? Any self-respecting tapas bar\n\nChurros\n\nChurros are a popular snack made from fried dough pastry, cut into sausage shapes and doused in sugar.\n\nThey're a favorite at fiestas, or street parties, when they're sold by roadside vendors.\n\nDipping them in hot melted chocolate is pretty much the law.\n\nWhere to try? San Gin\u00e9s, Madrid\n\nIglesia San Gines, Calle Arenal 13 Puerta del Sol, 28013 Madrid Spain;\n\nCroquetas\n\nAnother typical item on a tapas menu, croquetas are tubes of bechamel sauce encased in fried breadcrumbs, but a lot more tasty than that sounds.\n\nJam\u00f3n croquetas and salt cod croquetas are common varieties.\n\nThey're tricky to make and are perhaps best enjoyed at a tapas bar, along with a cold beer.\n\nWhere to try? Casa Julio, Madrid\n\nCasa Julio, Calle Madera 37, 28004 Madrid Spain;\n\nAlbondigas\n\nMeatballs: A must-have on the tapas table.\n\nA classic tapas item, albondigas, or meatballs in tomato sauce, are served all over Spain.\n\nA tasty variation serves up the meatballs drizzled in an almond sauce, minus the tomatoes.\n\nThe version pictured is a squid meatball, by Jos\u00e9 Pizarro.\n\nWhere to try? Cafe OMKA, Granada\n\nOm-Kalsum, Calle Jardines 17, 18002 Granada Spain;\n\nMigas\n\nA legendary dish spoken of in almost hushed tones by Spaniards, migas is a good example of how much of Spain's cuisine has evolved from peasant food.\n\nIt's essentially dry breadcrumbs torn up and fried in a variety of combinations -- often served with chorizo or bacon.\n\nMigas, handed down from agricultural laborers who had to be thrifty with their ingredients, is comfort food supreme -- and in recent times has found its way onto fancy restaurant menus.\n\n\"Like many traditional cuisines, the 'rustic roots' mostly show themselves in the use of basic or commonplace ingredients, ways of using everything available, such as nose-to-tail use of animals, dishes that use up leftovers -- including migas -- and methods of preservation such as curing and salting, pickling and preservation in oil,\" says Shawn Hennessey.\n\n\"For a modern-day nation such as Spain, tapas still has a high proportion of locally sourced food.\"\n\nWhere to try? Eustaquio Blanco, C\u00e1ceres\n\nEustaquio Blanco, Avenida Ruta de La Plata 2, 10001 Caceres Spain;\n\nBacalao\n\nBacalao: Best served with pil-pil sauce.\n\nA prized dish in Spain, bacalao, or salted cod, was brought back by Spanish fisherman from as far afield as Norway and Newfoundland -- the fish not being found in local waters; it was salted to preserve it on the journey.\n\nIt has to be left to soak in water for at least 24 hours to remove all but the slightest tang of salt.\n\nBacalao is served in all manner of dishes; one of the most popular is with pil-pil sauce, made of olive oil garlic and the juice of the fish, and typical in the Basque Country.\n\nWhere to try? Bar Gatz, Bilbao\n\nGatz, Calle Santa Maria 10, Bilbao Spain;\n\nFabada\n\nA favorite of the northwestern Asturias region and based around the white fabe bean, fabada is a one-pot feast usually served with a mixture of pork meats.\n\nChorizo, pork belly and bacon are common accompaniments, as is morcilla, Spanish blood sausage, which tastes far better than it should.\n\nWhere to try? Casa Gerardo, Prendes\n\nCasa Gerardo-Prendes, Carretera, 33438 Candas Spain;\n\nLeche frita\n\nThink it's impossible to fry milk?\n\nThink again.\n\nLeche frita, or fried milk, is a popular dessert made by whipping up milk, egg yolks and flour. This is left to chill and solidify, before being coated in breadcrumbs and fried.\n\nCan be served hot or cold.\n\nWhere to try? Casa Alvarez, Madrid",

    "text": "Stephanie Coontz teaches history at Evergreen State College and wrote the newly revised, \" The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap .\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) The problems bothering white Americans without a college degree have less to do with immediate economic insecurity or material hardship, although those are widespread, than with the collapse of a whole way of life.\n\nFollowing World War II, production workers experienced three decades of unprecedented economic and social gains. But since the end of the 1970s, they have seen a nearly unremitting decline in their real wages, working conditions and social status, along with a loss of the interpersonal and work networks that were once the basis of their upward progress and their entire community's stability.\n\nI think it's fair to say that large segments of the white working-class are feeling shell-shocked.\n\nOne pastor who has ministered to a congregation of whites in post-industrial central Philadelphia and to a rural congregation in Wisconsin said this of his parishioners: \"Every time something changed in their lives, it changed for the worse. And I mean just about every stinking time.\"\n\nThe rise and fall of stability in working-class life explains much that otherwise seems puzzling in the responses to this week's CNN-Kaiser Family Foundation poll. We've heard much about working-class anger. Yet the poll reveals a rather uncomplaining acceptance of what is, in many cases, a far from an easy life.\n\nSixty-three percent of white working-class respondents say they are \"very\" or \"somewhat\" satisfied with their personal financial situation, even though in the past year 46% of them say they postponed medical or dental care and half took an extra job or added work hours to make ends meet. About 30% of those who are employed face the stress of work shifts that change every week. But 76% say they are optimistic about what's going on in their personal life, and 77% of those who are working believe their jobs are secure.\n\nHowever, this willingness to see the upside of difficult living conditions coexists with a deep pessimism about the future, and especially their children's future. Fully half of working-class whites expect their children's lives will be worse than their own. Fewer than one-quarter expect their children to do better.\n\nWorking-class blacks and Hispanics are far more optimistic than their white counterparts, even though the unemployment rate of blacks without a college degree is twice as high as that of whites, as is the percentage of black workers who are working part time although they want full-time jobs.\n\nOn average, blacks and Hispanics have lower incomes and are less likely to own their homes. They lost more ground than whites during the recession and have regained less ground since. Yet 36% of working-class blacks and 48% of working-class Hispanics believe their children will do better than they.\n\nAnother striking difference is that only 45% of whites without a college education, compared to almost 75% of blacks and Hispanics, say their life would be better if they had a four-year college degree. Fifty-one percent of the whites think it would make no difference, and 3% feel it would have made things worse.\n\nThese attitudes stem from the tremendous leap forward that white working-class Americans made in the 1950s and 1960s. People who study race relations in America often talk about white privilege, but this is a relative concept when it comes to the working class. For 200 years, elites had encouraged a sense of white superiority to defuse class resentments and head off interracial class alliances. But as in so many conflicts, the foot soldiers of white dominance seldom got a very large share of the spoils.\n\nLow-income whites were given preference over minorities in hiring, wages, and promotions (except during strikes, when employers were quick to replace strikers with minorities whom they fired afterward, reinforcing hostility on both sides).\n\nYet their relative advantages over workers of other races did not produce a life of privilege for white production workers, who earned low wages with few benefits, faced frequent layoffs and suffered high rates of on-the-job injuries.\n\nA coal miner's boot remains inside the St. Nicholas Coal Breaker in Manahoy City, Pennsylvania.\n\nLife got better\n\nIn the decades after World War II, though, life got much better for white male workers and their families. The tremendous growth of unions, along with new government regulations, put a stop to some of the exploitative practices of employers. Meanwhile, from 1950 to 1979, government invested in infrastructure and new technologies at almost twice the rate since 1980, creating rapid blue-collar job growth.\n\nFor the first time, the American Dream came within reach for white blue-collar workers-- a dream not of immense wealth but of the ability to sustain a comfortable family life by working hard and well at your job. Between 1947 and 1973, the real wages of the average young male worker without a college education doubled as he moved from age 25 to 35. In 1959, the average 30-year-old man could pay the mortgage on a median-priced home using only 18% of his gross monthly pay.\n\nFor the first time, the American Dream came within reach for white blue-collar workers-- a dream not of immense wealth but of the ability to sustain a comfortable family life by working hard and well at your job. Stephanie Coontz\n\nAnd his wages continued to rise through his working life as new seniority laws prevented aging workers from being displaced or demoted. A man passing from age 40 to 50 saw his earnings increase by another 30 percent.\n\nPerhaps more important psychologically was that young people in that era could see that they were doing much better than their parents. In 1961, men aged 25 to 29 were, on average, earning four times more in real wages than their fathers at about the same age.\n\nA different kind of success\n\nThe basis of success in working-class communities was very different from how success is gained by today's mobile professionals. Working-class neighborhoods clustered around sources of employment, within walking distance from the small businesses that depended on them for customers, and often within sight of the homes of the managers who supervised them.\n\nThere was suspicion of strangers, and racial segregation was the norm, but there was less separation by class and income than today. Their bosses often frequented the same churches. Educated professionals had enough close contact with workers to respect the skill and stamina involved in what economists now call \"routine\" or \"semi-skilled\" labor.\n\nAt churches, work, and schools, people were enmeshed in stable personal networks that were far from egalitarian but were often the main way young men found a job and small businesses built their base. If you worked hard, respected your place in the social hierarchy, and conformed to community standards, you could expect to get a decent job, have the satisfaction of doing better than your own parents, and see your own kids do better than you.\n\nComing out of this tradition, it's no wonder that half of these individuals don't think having a four-year degree would have helped them. Their frame of reference is a world where you didn't need to go to college to do better than your father. It often made more sense to simply follow in his footsteps.\n\nThe erosion of such communities and workplaces has been going on for almost 40 years. Many manufacturing jobs have been lost or outsourced. Most that are still around or have come back now pay lower wages and provide fewer benefits. Between 1947 and 1979, for example, real wages of meatpacking workers increased by an average of 80 percent (to just under $40,000 per year in constant dollars). But from 1979 to 2012, those wages declined by 30%, to about $27,000 a year.\n\nThe old social contract -- and the old social contacts -- have, for good and for ill, ceased to organize work and community life.\n\nFor the past three decades, the average young man without a college degree has consistently done worse than his father. Between 1979 and 2007, young men with a high school degree suffered, on average, a 29% decline in real earnings.\n\nFor the past three decades, the average young man without a college degree has consistently done worse than his father. Stephanie Coontz\n\nHumans see things in relative terms. When we assess our present position and prospects, we do so in relation to our past experiences and expectations. Most white working-class Americans are still better off than most black and Hispanic non-college-educated workers, but they have been on a long, demoralizing downward slope. By contrast, although blacks and Hispanics started from a much lower base, they have seen remarkable progress since the early 1960s, despite suffering more than whites during recessions.\n\nIt is not surprising that so many white workers are pessimistic about their future. Even if their changes for the worse leave them better off than many of their black and Hispanic counterparts, people usually focus more on what they've lost rather than on the narrowing edge they may retain over others.\n\nWhy not go to college?\n\nBut why, many ask, aren't lower-income white men flocking to college? It's more complicated than lack of initiative. Ironically, one thing that now holds white working-class men back is the residue of their traditional race and gender bonus: Men who drop out of college initially earn, on average, as much as men who have recently completed their degree.\n\nThe college advantage multiplies over time, but it's tempting -- although self-defeating in the long run -- to start earning as much as Joe the new college grad without foregoing earnings for several years or taking on debt.\n\nFurthermore, going to college can be risky for people whose parents can't offer substantial support. Older Americans who brag of working their way through college may not realize that between 1975 and 2015, tuition and fees grew by more than 200% at community colleges and at private, nonprofit, four-year colleges and universities -- after accounting for inflation. At public four-year colleges and universities, they grew by nearly 300%.\n\nIn 1979, the average student at a four-year university could pay for tuition by working just 182 hours per year. By 2013, the average student had to work 991 hours. And unlike the early 1970s, most available aid takes the form of loans rather than outright grants.\n\nA recent study of 3,000 young adults who entered public four-year institutions in Wisconsin found that even with the help of Pell grants, college was still unaffordable. Only half the students received any credential within six years, a long time to put earnings on hold. Almost 40% dropped out, many saddled with debt that put them further behind than when they started.\n\nEven getting a degree does not guarantee getting a job that allows you to pay off debts. Since 2000, employment of college grads has grown more rapidly in low-earning than high-earning jobs.\n\nMany liberal politicians have failed to acknowledge those realities, and many conservatives have manipulated them to fan racial resentments. It's not just Trump who's been stirring the pot. Racial fears have been whipped up for years by the same politicians who now piously denounce them. Think Reagan's Welfare Queen, George H. Bush's Willie Horton, Jeb Bush's \"free stuff\" remarks, and the Clintons' \"Super-predators.\"\n\nRacism is not the only reason for Trump's popularity. A significant number of Trump supporters say they voted for Obama in 2012, and so far Obama seems to have done better with white working-class voters in Florida, Ohio, and Iowa than Clinton is currently doing.\n\nBlaming it on race\n\nBut the legacy of racism runs deep, especially in the old Confederacy. And in the absence of a clear acknowledgement of how and why white working-class men and communities have suffered and without any firm commitment to turn that around, many whites have been persuaded to blame their declining fortunes on blacks and immigrants.\n\nIn the 1950s, race outweighed education in determining wage rates. On average, white men with only a high school degree out-earned blacks with a college degree. Today, education outweighs race. But many working-class whites don't yet realize that this is not a result of reversed racial preferences but of new market preferences:\n\nStudies confirm that employers still favor white men over blacks in most labor markets where applicants have equal education. When nearly identical r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are sent out, for example, the candidate with a white-sounding name receives more callbacks than the applicant with a black-sounding name.\n\nSome whites look at the gains of black professionals, formerly held back by legally enforced discrimination, and say that \"those people\" are taking a job that could be theirs. Yet if educated minorities weren't in the picture, it would be OTHER white people, from more privileged families, taking those jobs. And when liberals respond by framing equal rights as a matter of \"compassion\" or \"tolerance,\" without mentioning the growing class divide, it's not entirely surprising that sections of the white working class mishear calls for diversity as endorsement of their accelerating marginalization.\n\nAs one young man complained while we were both waiting for relatives receiving treatment in a New Orleans hospital, \"everybody talks about the problems of the blacks, the illegals, the gays, the transgenders. But I see a lot more of them getting ahead than white guys like me.\" And an older woman told me \"I actually voted for hope and change, but we haven't gotten it down here, so when Clinton says, 'oh we already ARE great,' she loses me.\n\nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter. We welcome your ideas and comments.\n\nNone of this excuses racist reactions. The tragedy is that in the \"good old days\" for white Americans without a college degree, their prosperity was less dependent on their unfair advantages over minorities than on a social consensus reaching across both parties that government could and should invest in infrastructure projects that create jobs for working people and enforce policies that protect workers' bargaining power. In the 1960s, when civil-rights activism extended those opportunities and protections to minorities as well as whites, this resulted in increased progress for workers in general and for racial equality.\n\nThe political challenge today is how to acknowledge the legitimate sense of loss and exclusion experienced by white workers while persuading them that reestablishing racial and masculine privileges is a poor substitute for ensuring secure rights for all workers and getting rid of a political decision-making process that is rigged against them by business lobbyists and financial interest groups.\n\nSo far, most of Trump's establishment critics have failed to persuasively explain how they would create well-paying jobs and improve working people's bargaining power. Stephanie Coontz\n\nSo far, most of Trump's establishment critics have failed to persuasively explain how they would create well-paying jobs and improve working people's bargaining power. So we see growing numbers of people who think that in a stacked deck, a \"wild card\" might not be such a bad thing. As a retired deputy sheriff from Montana put it, Trump is \"risky\" but at least he's looking at things \"through a different scope.\"\n\nAttacking Trump's unpredictability might even help his cause. The last 40 years have been depressingly predictable for working-class communities and small towns, and Trump's critics need to establish that they too can be \"change agents\" -- but in a much more substantive way.",

Also, text highlights and a transcript of the discussion are below.\n\nMANDATORY CREDIT: CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\n\nContacts: Lauren Pratapas \u2014 Lauren.Pratapas@turner.com; Brooke Lorenz- Brooke.Lorenz@turner.com\n\nCNN STORY: Ron Johnson on ISIS: 'Our critical infrastructure is vulnerable\u2019\n\nTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\n\nJohnson on the possibility of ISIS accessing a nuclear plant: [TAPPER] \u201cAre you at all concerned that ISIS could infiltrate a nuclear plant in Europe? Or is that just too far afield, do you think? [JOHNSON] \u201cNo, no, I'm highly concerned about that, but not only in Europe. Look at the attack on the Metcalf power station in California. We have not solved that. That is a very disconcerting chain of events here. So, trust me, our critical infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber-attack, to potential terrorist attack. And we're not taking this threat seriously enough. It's highly concerning.\u201d\n\nJohnson on the threat of another ISIS attack in Europe: \u201cWell, we're being told there are no specific, credible threats. And I have to believe the officials. And it would make sense that there are probably more plots being hatched in Europe as we speak. Europe obviously is in greater danger. They're in closer proximity to the Middle East. We're seeing this surge of refugees. We now know that a couple of those terrorists came into Europe with that refugee flow. So what we're unraveling or what the officials in Europe are unraveling are these cells and these plots. And, unfortunately, this is exactly what Islamic terrorists are trying to sow, what you're seeing in Brussels today, the type of civil unrest. They're trying to destabilize different countries. And they're doing a pretty good job of it.\n\nJohnson on his strategy to defeat ISIS: \u201cWe need to just have a more robust effort. We need to assemble that coalition of the willing. And the reason we haven't assembled them is because we have not shown the leadership. President Obama took off the table that - the same day that he declared the goal, he basically took off the table the very ingredient that was going to be necessary. And that's American troops on the ground. Now, I don't think we have to have that many of them. We haven't heard out of this administration a real strategy for defeating ISIS. But we actually have to show the leadership, so that the coalition of the willing will actually assemble around us. And let's face it. I think Europe is probably a little bit more primed to really join that coalition. This has got to be a long-term effort. The historic blunder of President Obama was leaving Iraq. After all the sacrifice, after the stabilization of the Iraq, we bugged out. And as a result, that coalition disintegrated, and ISIS was able to rise from the ashes of what was a defeated al Qaeda in Iraq. We have to learn the lessons of histories. We have to be relentless in our pursuit of stamping out Islamic terror.\u201d\n\nJohnson on using torture as an interrogation technique: [TAPPER] \u201c\u2026Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, said this week he would have talked a lot faster with the torture. Do you agree?\u201d [JOHNSON] \u201cWhat we really need to do - and I have been down to Guantanamo Bay and I have talked to the people that do the interviews. And the way you actually gather intelligence that's effective is over a long period of time. And what this administration has done, in their quest to close down Guantanamo Bay, we stopped capturing, detaining and questioning Islamic terrorists. Now, we're doing some of that. We're starting to capture some of the Islamic terrorists, some of the ISIS operatives. Fortunately, we captured one that was a former Iraqi chemical weapons expert. And that individual apparently started to sing like a canary. So, we were able to take out some of those installations. But we need a long-term facility for long-term detention. And that's really how you gather intelligence, is capturing people, detaining them, and interviewing them over a long period of time, finding discrepancies between themselves - between their own testimony and that of their fellow operatives.\u201d\n\nFULL POST",

    "text": "Amy Laitinen is deputy director for higher education at New America. She previously served as a policy adviser to the undersecretary and assistant secretary for vocational and adult education at the U.S. Department of Education and the White House. This is the latest in a series, \"Big Ideas for a New America,\" in which the think tank New America spotlights experts' solutions to the nation's greatest challenges. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) The cost of college has rapidly increased over the past 30 years. Students today face annual costs, between tuition and living, that can easily exceed $10,000 at a community college, $18,000 at a public four-year college (in-state), and $40,000 at a private four-year school. It's unsurprising that today's students often graduate with large debt loads. More than two-thirds of students graduate with debt. And the average amount of debt owed is about $30,000 .\n\nGiven the cost of college, students and families need to know that they're making a good investment. That's why we need to move to a system where we measure learning outcomes, not just time spent in a classroom accumulating credits.\n\nA college degree is the only sure path to middle-class security, and because young people and their parents know that, the cost of college, and the availability of loans and other aid, has become a powerful political issue. But for all the attention paid to the price of college, we haven't given enough thought to whether students and their families are getting their money's worth. Is American higher education worth the price? Are students and their families getting what they're paying for?\n\nThere's plenty of evidence that for many of them, the answer is no. In 2006, a government study found that nearly 70% of college graduates could not perform basic tasks like comparing opposing editorials. In a 2011 book, \"Academically Adrift,\" researchers studied 2,000 students at two dozen universities over four years and found that 45% of them showed no significant gains on a test of critical thinking, complex reasoning, and communication skills after two years of college. Even at the end of four years, 36% of the students hadn't gained those skills.\n\nGiven the evidence, maybe it's not a surprise that employers aren't impressed by recent college graduates.\n\nEmployers want the skills that higher education says it provides to students: the ability to critically think, communicate, work in a team, write effectively, and adapt. Yet only about one-quarter of employers say that colleges and universities are doing a good job in preparing students effectively for the challenges of today's global economy. A recent Gallup poll found that only 11% of business leaders strongly agreed that college graduates have the skills necessary to succeed on the job. In addition to money, these graduates have spent hours and hours in classrooms and taking tests, but the time doesn't seem to have translated into learning.\n\nWhy is this? Perhaps it's as simple as this: We measure education in terms of time, rather than learning. A four-year degree attests that you have acquired 120 credits. That's an accidental result of the credit hour system, which was created by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie more than 100 years ago, for the purpose of providing struggling professors with pensions.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Carnegie created a $10 million free pension fund to help professors retire. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which was set up to administer the fund, determined that only \"full-time\" faculty would qualify for pensions, which they defined as teaching 12 \"credit units,\" with each unit equal to one hour of faculty-student contact time per week, over a 15-week semester. While originally a narrow measure of faculty workload, the credit hour quickly morphed into much more. The Carnegie Foundation warned against using the credit hour as a proxy for student learning, but the temptation of an easy-to-understand and seemingly standardized measure was too great to resist. It just made organizing the whole higher education enterprise much easier.\n\nIf credit hours truly reflected a standardized unit of learning, they would be fully transferable across institutions. An hour in Arizona is an hour in New York. But colleges routinely reject credits earned at other colleges, suggesting that even though they use credit hours themselves, they know they are not a reliable measure of how much students have learned. Many students, however, believe the fiction that the credit hour is a standardized currency and assume that credits will transfer from one school to the next. This is an unfortunate and costly assumption, as community college students in Louisiana will tell you.\n\nUntil recently, Louisiana students with an associate degree typically lost between 21 and 24 credits when transferring to a four-year state school. That's a year of time and money lost. Given that nearly 60% of students in the United States attend two or more colleges, the nontransfer of credits has huge costs, not only to individuals, but also to the federal government and states that are financing this duplicative classroom time. If higher education doesn't trust its own credits, why should anyone else? And Louisiana students aren't alone; transfer students across the country lose credits, which lengthens their time to get a degree.\n\nSo we have two problems: Students who have earned credits -- at great expense in time and money-- can't use or transfer them. Others who have accumulated costly credits haven't learned much.\n\nAnd then there's a third dimension: Millions of people who have learned a great deal have no \"credit\" because they learned it at the wrong place \u2014 that is to say, not at a \"college.\" Someone who has spent the last 10 years working as a nurse's aid in a hospital who decides to go get a nursing degree has to start from scratch, taking introductory courses he could probably teach, because colleges treat those without credits as blank slates. Employees at a biotech company with a high-quality on-the-job training program might learn more than someone in a two-year college science program, but unless this training is attached to an accredited institution of higher learning, the learning won't \"count.\" For the millions of adult workers looking to retrain and reskill, the focus on time rather than learning, especially when between family and work, their time is scarce, is a daunting proposition.\n\nState and federal governments add to the problem, because while they spend hundreds of billions on higher education each year, most of it is for time served, in the form of credit hours, rather than learning achieved.\n\nWe need to stop counting time and start counting learning.\n\nWhat could that look like? We don't have to wonder; some schools are experimenting with measuring learning rather than time\u2014some for decades. One relatively new program is Southern New Hampshire University's College for America, or CfA , an online \"competency-based\" Associate of Arts degree aimed at working adults. The program has no courses, no credit hours and no grades. The school has broken down what students with a degree from CfA should know and be able to do, what it calls competencies. CfA worked closely with employers to identify the competencies employers were looking for, like communication, critical thinking and teamwork. Then faculty designed real-world tasks and projects to determine whether students had mastered each competency.\n\nUnlike in credit-hour courses, CfA has no seat-time requirements. Students can move through the program as quickly as they can demonstrate mastery of the competencies. Someone who worked at a PR firm might whiz through the communications competencies and spend more time on the math competencies. And the faster students can progress, the less they will ultimately pay. Students pay $1,250 for all-they-can-learn in six months.\n\nThis means they can spend their precious time and money learning what they don't already know, rather than wasting it on what they already do. Students at CfA can be confident that their time and money are well spent and, at the end, they will have a very clear picture of what they know and can do. CfA is not the only one to offer this to students, nor the only model. Hundreds of schools, from Antioch to the University of Michigan to Purdue University, are looking to offer competency-based certificate, associate, and baccalaureate degree programs. How are universities staying afloat financially with such low tuition? In many cases, the answer is surprisingly simple\u2014and, sadly, not commonplace in higher education\u2014by focusing on what students need in order to, wait for it, learn. Fancy amenities, great football teams and sprawling college campuses may bring attention, but they have little to nothing to do with student learning. Some competency-based programs don't focus on research -- faculty are hired for specific expertise, like curriculum design, English literature or advising. Other programs use technology and data analytics to help students and faculty understand where students are doing well and where they are struggling. This allows for more targeted, personalized support by faculty.\n\nThere is, however, a downside for students: Self-paced competency-based programs do not fit in neatly with the historically time-based credit hour, making it difficult for students in these types of programs to receive state and federal support. Without access to these dollars, the programs will remain one-offs and unavailable to the majority of Americans who could use them.\n\nOnly recently has the federal government recognized the role it could play in encouraging the move from seat time to learning by redirecting some of its nearly $150 billion-plus financial aid budget. The U.S. Department of Education is encouraging innovation by colleges looking to experiment with alternatives to the credit hour , and there is strong bipartisan interest in both the House and Senate to explore innovative ways of paying for learning, rather than time.\n\nAs higher education becomes increasingly necessary and expensive, measuring time rather than learning is a luxury that students, taxpayers and the nation can no longer afford. Paying for what students learn and can do, rather than how or where they spent their time, would go a long way toward providing students and the nation with desperately needed, high-quality degrees and credentials.",

I said \u2018thank you so much, I just got hit by a mano.\u2019 And then he tried to get me on the shortboard, but I couldn't get on there very well.\u201d\n\nOpfer said his shortboard was too small to transport her to shore, so he yelled for his friend Danny Boro, who had a longboard.\n\n\"She said she couldn't breath and she had a hard time breathing,\u201d Boro said. \u201cSo what was going through my mind was, I was kind of freaked out myself as I was paddling her in because everything was happening so fast and I didn't know how much blood she lost and so I was just, as much as I could, get her on my board and get her to the other rescue board,\" Boro said.\n\nBy that time, lifeguards had paddled out.\n\n\"When they grabbed her, they found she had bite marks on her shoulder, her forearm. We brought her in and called the ambulance,\" said Jason Patterson, an Ocean Safety lieutenant.\n\nShe was taken to the hospital in serious condition, but has since been recovering.\n\n\u201cIt's not the shark's fault, it's not the shark's fault,\u201d Aunty Lulu said. \u201cIt's their home, they've been doing what they've been doing for centuries feeding. It is absolutely not their fault.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 Hawaii News Now. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "The second-floor apartment was a beautiful and spacious, smartly appointed two bedroom in San Francisco's posh Pacific Heights neighborhood. It was pricey, about $400 a night on Airbnb, and came with an unexpected caveat.\n\nAlong with a complimentary bottle of California wine, renters were greeted with a handwritten note warning them to lie if they ran into any neighbors. If anyone asked questions, they were instructed to say they were just friends of the family.\n\nShort-term rental hosts are getting crafty when it comes to working around rules. But now they're not just going up against nosy neighbors. There's a new wave of startups that investigate and catch hosts who are violating building regulations and local laws. They're hired by landlords concerned about quality of life or insurance issues, and cities worried about diminishing housing stock or people not paying proper taxes.\n\nLandlords, apartment managers, and condo associations hire Austin-based startup BNBShield to catch tenants illegally renting out their apartments. Launched in February, BNBShield employees aren't staking out buildings, looking for strangers with roller luggage. It uses custom software to comb through listings in a given area and match information with known features in a specific building.\n\nRelated: Why everyone is cracking down on Airbnb\n\nSome buildings have the same floors, windows, crown molding, or refrigerators in all units. BNBShield can put that into its database and scan photos to ID tenants.\n\nJacques Casimir, the 36-year-old founder of BNBShield, says many hosts are getting smarter about not posting identifying details on listings, such a photo of the outside of a building.\n\nMost hosts are regular people trying to make cash while they're away. But Casimir has also seen a single person take out multiple leases on 13 apartments and rent them out 24/7, creating an underground hotel business.\n\nIllegal hotels aside, why would landlords pay money just to crack down on a tenant's side hustle? David Shapiro of SubletAlert.com says it's a combination of issues. His San Francisco company makes tools that real estate and building management companies can use to find short-term rentals.\n\nHaving strangers come and go can be a safety and quality of life issue for other tenants. Buildings often have specific insurance policies that don't cover short-term sublets. And Shapiro says a steady stream of vacationers has greater wear and tear on buildings.\n\nLike BNBShield, SubletAlert doesn't handle evictions or enforcement. The companies turn the information over to clients who decide how to proceed, typically starting with a warning.\n\n(Landlords aren't always the victims. In one Los Angeles criminal case, owners of a building are accused of illegally evicting all tenants and turning the units into more lucrative Airbnb rentals.)\n\nIncreasingly, Airbnb-like sites are catching the attention of local governments. Different cities and towns are enacting their own patchwork laws to address the proliferation of short-term rentals.\n\nEvery city has different reasons. Some are facing housing shortages and want to make sure apartments are being used for full-time tenants. Others are vacation towns that want to encourage tourism while making sure proper taxes are collected. Many communities are concerned about quality of life issues, like too much noise.\n\nAirbnb says it supports regulation, but the company has clashed with some cities that it sees as going to far. The company is currently suing San Francisco over a new rule that requires all hosts to register with the city.\n\nRelated: Airbnb has sued its hometown of San Francisco\n\nHost Compliance is another startup that helps cities enforce their short-term rental laws. The company has worked with about 15 cities, including Vancouver, Pasadena, Los Angeles and Truckee, a resort town near Lake Tahoe, California.\n\nThe company scrapes together all the information it can find on local short-term listings and sends notices to hosts on behalf of the cities. It might tell them to register or pay taxes, or inform them of other city rules. It has a hotline for neighbors who want to report issues such as noise or parking, then it gathers evidence to back up the claim for cities to take action.\n\n\"The world is better for short-term rentals if they behave correctly,\" said Host Compliance founder Ulrik Binzer. Like the other startups, he doesn't see Host Compliance as taking on Airbnb, but picking up where the company leaves off.\n\n\"If this industry is to be sustainable in the long run, we have to accept that it's here to stay so we get ourselves out of thinking we can regulate it into oblivion,\" said Binzer.\n\nAirbnb seems to err on the side of minimal enforcement. It does list local regulations on its site, but doesn't check on listings itself. If a neighbor or building owner complains to the company, it will reach out to the host and help them address the problem. The company declined to comment on third-party policing startups.\n\n\"I think people will try and characterize us as trying to take away people's ability to make money,\" said BNBShield's Casimir. \"But if you're playing the game correctly, then everybody gets to play.\"",

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\n(CNN) From the legendary Tower of Babel to the iconic Burj Khalifa, humans have always aspired to build to ever greater heights. Over the centuries, we have constructed towering edifices to celebrate our culture, promote our cities -- or simply to show off.\n\nHistorically, tall structures were the preserve of great rulers, religions and empires. For instance, the Great Pyramids of Giza -- built to house the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu -- once towered over 145 meters high. It was the tallest man-made structure for nearly 4,000 years, before being overtaken by the 160-meter-tall Lincoln Cathedral in the 14th century. Other edifices, such as Tibet's Potala Palac e (the traditional home of the Dalai Lama), or the monasteries of Athos were constructed atop mountains or rocky outcrops, to bring them even closer to the heavens.\n\nYet these grand historical efforts are dwarfed by the skyscrapers of the 20th and 21st centuries. London's Shard looms at 310 meters tall at its fractured tip -- but it's made to look small by the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa , which stands at more than 828 meters. And both these behemoths will be left in the shadows by the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Originally planned by architect Adrian Smith to reach 1,600 meters, the tower is now likely to reach one kilometer high, once it's completed in 2020.\n\nSo how did we make this great leap upwards?\n\nIngredients for success\n\nWe can trace our answer back to the 1880s, when the first generation of skyscrapers appeared in Chicago and New York. The booming insurance businesses of the mid-19th century were among the first enterprises to exploit the technological advancements, which made tall buildings possible.\n\nConstructed in the aftermath of the great fire of 1871, Chicago's Home Insurance building -- completed in 1884 by William Le Baron Jenney -- is widely considered to be the first tall building of the industrial era, at 12 stories high.\n\nArchitects Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler first coined the term \"tall office building\" in 1896, drawing on the architectural precedent of Italy's Renaissance palazzi. His definition denoted that the first two stories are given over to the entrance way and retail activity, with a service basement below, repeated stories above and a cornice or attic story to finish the building at the top. Vertical ducts unite the building with power, heat and circulation. This specification still holds good today.\n\nThe American technological revolution of 1880 to 1890 saw a burst of creativity that produced a wave of new inventions that helped architects to build higher than ever before: Bessemer steel, formed into I-sections in the new rolling mills enabled taller and more flexible frame design than the cast iron of the previous era; the newly patented sprinkler head allowed buildings to escape the strict, 23-meter height limit, which was imposed to control the risk of fire; and the patenting of AC electricity allowed elevators to be electrically powered and rise to ten or more stories.\n\nPhotos: Timber and bamboo -- wooden buildings are branching out Wooden skyscrapers \u2013 This floating wooden pavilion is the Pavillion of Reflections in Zurich.

Hide Caption 19 of 19\n\nEarly tall buildings contained offices. The typewriter, telephone and US universal postal system also appeared in this decade, and they revolutionized office work and enabled administration to be concentrated in individual highrise buildings within a city's business district.\n\nChanges in urban life also encouraged the switch to taller, higher-density facilities. Street trams, subways and elevated rail links provided the means to deliver hundreds of workers to a single urban location, decades before the European motor car appeared on American streets and reshaped urban form away from the city grid.\n\nApart from a few high rise mansion blocks around Central Park, New York, the terraced house reigned supreme in the crowded cities of the pre motor car age, such as Paris, London, and Manhattan, and evolved to nine stories in ultra dense Hong Kong.\n\nEarly office towers filled their city blocks entirely, with buildings enclosing a large light and air-well, as an squared U, O or H shape. This permitted natural light and ventilation within the building, but didn't provide any public spaces. Chicago imposed a height limit of 40 meters in 1893, but New York raced ahead with large and tall blocks. Many of these, such as the Singer, Woolworth, MetLife and Chrysler buildings, tapered off with \"campanile\" towers, battling to be tallest in the world.\n\nSecond-generation giants\n\nIn 1915, following the completion of the 40-story Equitable building on Broadway, there was such alarm at the darkening streets that New York introduced \"zoning laws\" that forced new buildings to step ziggurat-like as they rose, in order to bring daylight down to street level.\n\nThis meant that while the base still filled the city block, the rest of the tower would rise centrally, stepping back every few stories, and it forced the service core to the building's center, leading to the loss of the light well and making mechanical ventilation and artificial lighting essential for human habitation. This was a radical change in the shape of tall buildings, and the second generation of skyscrapers.\n\nAs architectural historian Carol Willis would have it, \"form follows finance\": the developers of early 20th century high rise office blocks would work out how to maximize the amount of usable floor-space in a city site, before asking an architect to put a wall around it. Such vast wall surfaces with conventional windows invited patterns of geometric decoration, and the ziggurat style came to be the most recognizable architectural symbol of the Art Deco movement.\n\nThe mania for profit-driven tall development got out of hand in the late 1920s, however, and culminated in 1931 with the Chrysler and the Empire State buildings. The oversupply of office buildings, the depression of the 1930s and World War II brought an end to the Art Deco boom. There were no more skyscrapers until the 1950s, when the post-war era summoned forth a third generation: the International Style, the buildings of darkened glass and steel-framed boxes, with air conditioning and plaza fronts that we see in so many of the world's cities today.",

He is the author of \" Jimmy Carter \" and \" The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society .\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) During Monday's presidential debate, one of the most beneficial moments for Hillary Clinton came during the discussion about Donald Trump's tax returns.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about his refusal to release his tax returns and Clinton cited several returns from the 1970s that showed he didn't pay taxes then, Trump did not retreat. Instead he doubled down, saying, \"That makes me smart.\"\n\nAvoiding taxes, according to Trump, is a virtue, not a vice.\n\nThe comment could prove to be extremely damaging if Democrats capitalize on it. According to The Washington Post, a group of undecided voters watching the debate in North Carolina, a vital battleground state, gasped aloud when they heard Trump stay this . \"That's offensive. I pay taxes,\" one 52-year old civil servant said.\n\nThe controversy over his argument brings back memories of the last presidential election. In the middle of the 2012 campaign, Republican Mitt Romney struggled when his opponents -- first, Newt Gingrich in the Republican primaries and then President Obama in the general election -- hammered away at stories about the ways that Bain Capital wreaked havoc on entire communities when their investments did not go well.\n\nThey also went after how relatively little Romney paid in income taxes. Romney \"paid only 14 percent in taxes -- probably less than you,\" one of Obama's ads stated.\n\nThose stories, combined with the infamous video clip of Romney complaining about Obama's supporters, who he characterized as being part of the 47% of Americans who are dependent on government, enabled the Democrats to create an image of the Republican nominee as a champion of wealth and privilege. That didn't sit well with many middle class Americans who struggle to get by.\n\nBut when he appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show on Tuesday, Trump didn't back down from his taxes comment. Many people, he claimed, say \"that's the kind of thinking that I want running this nation.\"\n\nWhile some conservatives will praise Trump's well-documented efforts to avoid paying income taxes, his comments might prove to be harmful given the basic premise of his campaign. At the heart of the Trump candidacy has been the promise to help the millions of Americans who are not enjoying the fruits of the revived economy.\n\nEven as all the economic indicators point upward, their daily lives are fraught with uncertainty, insecurity, and constant struggle. Although much of the debate did not go well for Trump, many agree that his most effective moments came when he hammered away in the first half hour on economic issues and baited Clinton into defending free trade agreements.\n\nBut the comment about taxes gets to a fundamental weakness in the Trump appeal. At this point there is no \"there\" there. The actual policies on the economy that the GOP has promoted in recent years don't quite deliver on the promises he is making.\n\nThere is little evidence that the Republican agenda of deregulation, supply-side tax cuts, and cutting the social safety net add up to an economic future that is better for most Americans. Trump has been less clear on where he stands with domestic programs, other than Social Security and Medicare (where he broke with Ryan's reform agenda), but his economic policies generally fit under the Republican tent.\n\nDemocrats have gone to great lengths to argue that Republican economic policies are highly regressive and tend to support the kinds of economic forces that have undercut the security of the middle class. When Trump, a wealthy man, boasts that he doesn't pay taxes, he plays right into an image of greed and elitism that can be used to undercut the arguments he is making to working voters in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nThis is an argument that Clinton needs to emphasize, one that goes beyond the attacks on whether he is competent enough to hold office. The Trump appeal to disaffected Democrats is a two-part mix -- one part anger against immigrants who he incorrectly claims are taking away American jobs, and the second an attack on the economic policies of his opponent.\n\nWhile the first part of the Trump agenda will be hard for Clinton to combat, given that those animosities are deeply imbedded, the other part can be debated more successfully with undecided voters. She will have to debate his conservative populism if she wants to reverse the kind of poll movement in Trump's direction that we saw over the past month.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe tax comment gets right to the heart of a fundamental problem with the Trump campaign. Conservatism populism does not have a strong policy foundation. Trump claims to be the candidate of average Americans and he claims to be the candidate who will help struggling workers, but there is so much about his background as a businessman and his actual economic policy proposals (which have not been as unorthodox as some claim) that don't support that argument.\n\nThere is a reason that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have both been highly critical of Clinton in the past, are making it clear that they have no doubts about their preference in this general election.\n\nWhen Trump boasted in the debate that he was proud of not fulfilling one of the most basic obligations of all citizens -- paying their taxes -- particularly as someone who allegedly has so much wealth, he opened up a huge opportunity for Clinton.\n\nIn the next few weeks we will see if she runs with this and can avoid getting sucked into a back and forth of character assassination that will become more tempting as Trump and his surrogates unload on her marital history, her emails and the Clinton Foundation. As Bill Clinton's campaign understood in 1992, \"It's the economy stupid,\" and Democrats would do well to remember that lesson.",

The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.\n\nDavid Gergen: Clinton crushed Trump, but was that enough?\n\nComing into the presidential debate, I thought that if Hillary Clinton won decisively, she would virtually lock up the election. Coming out, it was clear that she did win decisively but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close.\n\nBy all traditional standards of debate, Mrs. Clinton crushed. She carefully marshaled her arguments and facts and then sent them into battle with a smile. She rolled out a long list of indictments against Donald Trump, often damaging. By contrast, he came in unprepared, had nothing fresh to say, and increasingly gave way to rants. As the evening ended, the media buried him in criticisms.\n\nEven so, I doubt she has put him away. For one thing, Trump supporters aren't judging him by traditional standards. They have heard establishment politicians over-promise and under-deliver for so long that they crave something different. They were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias. Trump was an angry figure, yes, but he is also giving voice to their anger. Those who are for him are likely to stick, despite his ineffectual performance.\n\nEqually to the point, Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters. She has been vexed with the issue of likeability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully. Her arguments last night should have made voters think, but I am not sure they will make them march.\n\nPerhaps I am wrong. Perhaps Hillary did lock up the race Monday night. Trump certainly blew it. But I imagine the race goes on, and the ultimate decision will be left where it should be: with the voters.

Not \"who looked more presidential,\" or \"who fact-checked whom the best.\" Those aspects go to their bases, not the voters who will determine this election outcome: undecideds.\n\nHillary Clinton had one job. She had to make Donald Trump look dumb. For undecideds, it will matter less that he's a bully or a liar. She has issues with trust, too. What will scare them is how unprepared he is. Every chance she gets to point this out has the potential to add points. Unfortunately for Clinton, she didn't take many of them. While she pointed out that his \"cavalier attitude\" toward nuclear weapons was dangerous, time and again, she punted at opportunities to point out how ill-informed and unprepared Trump is. Instead, she preferred to argue his vague platform on its merits. For her, this wasn't damaging, but it didn't move the needle in her favor.\n\nIn contrast, Trump mostly did the job he had to do. To move undecideds, he had to hammer one point home: Clinton is a politician who doesn't get it. Over and over again, he attacked her as more of the same, out of touch, and a politician who hasn't gotten it right. He didn't go after her character or personal issues, for the most part -- which voters know well. She outmanned him on specifics and details. But his attacks were far more effective than hers.\n\nWhile Clinton was right to suggest the fact-checkers get busy on his statements -- many were misleading -- if I'm looking at who moved the needle tonight with voters, it was Trump, not Clinton. And, Robby Mook, I assure you, this anti-Trump conservative isn't grading him \"on a curve.\"\n\nS.E. Cupp is the author of \" Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,\" co-author of \" Why You're Wrong About the Right \" and a columnist at the New York Daily News.\n\nErrol Louis: Where Clinton damaged Trump\n\nErrol Louis\n\nHillary Clinton did her homework on Donald Trump in the week leading up to tonight's debate, and the prep work paid off, especially when it came to his business record.\n\nThe former secretary of state needled the Donald's business record, hitting on well-reported incidents and turning his claim to fame against him. She brought up his handful of bankruptcies , allegations that he's stiffed workers, his pining for the housing crisis for his own benefit and his aversion to releasing his perpetually under-audit tax returns.\n\n\"It must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide,\" Clinton said of Trump's tax returns, turning the tables on allegations that she's hiding something in her deleted emails. \"It just seems to me that this is something the American people deserve to see.\"\n\nClinton even took a step further and pointed out that Trump didn't pay any income tax returns in certain years, a strategy designed to chip away at the blue-collar demographic that he's cultivated in the last few years. Trump, who's worked up a populist campaign saying that the government has stiffed the little guy, put his own foot in his mouth, butted in and said \"that makes me smart.\"\n\nClinton came into the night neck-and-neck with Trump in key states like Colorado and Pennsylvania, needing to weaken her Republican opponent on some of the things that have made him strong. It's a strategy her campaign has taken since July, when it rolled out an architect who claimed Trump shortchanged him over work at a golf course. (To twist the knife in his side, Clinton noted that the architect was in the audience tonight.)\n\nIt was a tough attack to which Trump will need an answer in future debates.\n\nMel Robbins: Hillary Clinton got bad advice\n\nMel Robbins\n\nAs a Clinton supporter, it pains me to say Trump won.\n\nClinton was too restrained, too smart -- and as much as I hate to say it -- she was too presidential. And being presidential won't help her win the election. She spoke to the intellectuals tuning in; she did not speak to the average American.\n\nHer advisers told her to restrain from attacking Trump. She got the wrong counsel and it could cost her the election.\n\nHer rebuttal to Trump's incoherent rants was to chuckle and tell viewers to check in with the fact checkers. The fact checkers won't win the election for her.\n\nShe needed to take him out at the knees. We know Clinton is smart, what we needed to see was a woman who is tough and won't take nonsense from anyone. She failed to do that tonight. Tonight, she was nice. Nice won't win the presidency.\n\nDonald spent the night sniffing constantly before he spoke. To paraphrase one tweeter: He's allergic to his own crap.\n\nHe lost the 400-pound vote but he won the debate and unless Clinton changes tactics he's going to win the election.\n\nMel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards.\n\nTara Setmayer: Trump kept taking the bait\n\nTara Setmayer\n\nAs a real estate mogul, Donald Trump is more than familiar with the expression \"location, location, location.\" In presidential debates, it's temperament, temperament, temperament. History has not been kind to Dan Quayle's perceived weakness, George H. W. Bush's time check or Al Gore's sighs. And it won't be kind to Trump's undisciplined, defensive rants.\n\nTrump's debate performance was a combined rehash of the insolence of his primary debates, the rambling hyperbole of his rallies, with a sprinkle of detail to bolster his message of economic populism. Although Trump scored points on that issue, he whiffed badly when confronted about his failure to release his taxes and struck out on the issues of race, birtherism and foreign policy. It was, frankly, surprising how easily Trump took Hillary's bait.\n\nComing into Monday night's debate, national polls were essentially tied and battleground states were tightening. With expectations set historically low, all Trump had to do was behave well enough to convince undecided voters he was in fact fit to hold the highest office in the land. In order to win the White House, Trump needs more moderates, minorities and women to support him. Yet he engaged in juvenile attacks on Hillary's looks and stamina instead of her failed record. Trump had an opportunity to put Hillary Clinton away and failed miserably. He is who is he is and continues to act unworthy of the office.\n\nTara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep.

She pulled off a victory, but only after Trump looked as if he might run away with that victory in the first half of the debate. Clinton was clearly in command of the facts, but Trump was making the simpler -- if highly inaccurate -- case for defending American jobs. Substance aside, he initially came across as caring about those who have lost jobs to trade. But Trump's initial strength unraveled as the debate progressed.\n\nBy the time it was over, Clinton unmasked Trump as a con man over his failure to release tax returns and penchant for not paying his workers. He all but acknowledged he doesn't pay taxes, saying \"they would be wasted,\" seeming more like an abusive one-percenter than a man of the people. His birther explanation made no sense, and his claim that Hillary has been \"fighting ISIS your entire life,\" was as ridiculous as his notion of stealing Iraq's oil. His denial of the well-established fact that he supported the Iraq war was a most awkward dance.\n\nClinton's decision to address America's allies, reassuring them that the United States will abide by its treaty obligations, was a brilliant touch, a reminder that she was the true adult on the stage, particularly after highlighting Trump's \"cavalier\" claims, which he has made, that other countries should arm themselves with nuclear weapons. First set was Trump's. But Hillary handily won the match.\n\nFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis\n\nTim Stanley: A technical win for Trump\n\nTimothy Stanley\n\nThat was probably the first and last debate in presidential history to include a discussion of Rosie O'Donnell's looks. As such, it was tremendous entertainment -- pure reality TV. But it was also very hard to pick a winner. Donald Trump won on the basis of spectacle. Hillary Clinton's strategy was to rise above the occasion and let him talk himself into losing. That actually allowed Trump to land one blow after another without Clinton fighting back. She wittily put him down a couple of times. But mostly she just smiled oddly at the camera. She was, to use a Trumpism, low energy. That was a mistake.\n\nYes, Trump sunk to new lows when discussing the birther issue -- claiming that he helped put it to rest when he actually stirred it up. Yes, he was barely coherent on defense, taxes etc. There was a three-minute section when he detailed a phone call with Sean Hannity about Iraq. Yes, The Donald was low on specifics, too. But he did have clear themes that he rammed home. After 90 grueling minutes, I looked down at my pad and read back the key words that I'd jotted down. \"Law and order.\" \"Country doing badly.\" \"Bad experience.\" \"Emails.\" Clinton's policies on solar panels and equal pay did not cut through. It could not compete with his passion, his articulation of populist anger.\n\nSo I give this a technical win to Trump because he understood the format, he blew it apart, and he dominated the evening. But that will alienate as many people as it will attract. Moreover, I'm not even sure it'll make that big a difference. Objectively deducing who won or lost is almost impossible when partisan tensions are this high. Most viewers either agree with him or with her. And a small minority watched it and thought, \"How the hell did things come to this?\" The debate will likely harden impressions, not soften hearts. The impression is that Trump has matured into an effective champion of the working class. But Clinton looks like a president-in-waiting.\n\nTimothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain's Daily Telegraph.

We welcome your ideas and comments.\n\nRoxanne Jones: Note to Trump: Talking loud a losing strategy\n\nRoxanne Jones\n\nOut of control. That's how I'd describe the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. What a train wreck for any voter who wanted to hear details about policy. Instead, we got Trump shouting insults and one-liners, interrupting Clinton, trying to take over the conversation. Shockingly, Trump admitting to the world: He was \"smart\" not to pay his federal income taxes; he supported a return of \"stop and frisk\" policing, even though it was ruled racial profiling and unconstitutional by the courts; and he defended his family's housing discrimination practices against blacks and Latinos, essentially saying it was just something everyone did back then.\n\nClinton's sit-back-and-watch-him-implode strategy was frustrating at times but it worked. She could, however, show more passion when discussing her policies. On the issue of race, Clinton missed a perfect opportunity to talk more about her plan for law enforcement reforms and systematic racism in our justice system. Still for me, Trump lost the debate tonight. Talking loud and saying little shouldn't be a path to the White House.\n\nScore One for Clinton.\n\nRoxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. She was named a 2010 Woman of the Year by Women in Sports and Events, is a co-author of \"Say It Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete,\" and CEO of the Push Marketing. She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency.\n\nJulian Zelizer: Debate unlikely to have dramatic impact\n\nOverall, it is unclear that Monday night's debate will have a huge impact on the direction of the polls. The best moments for Donald Trump came in the first half hour, where he baited her into defending unpopular free trade deals.\n\nThere were many reasons that Hillary Clinton supporters could be pleased with her performance. At several points, Trump was irritated and angry. He delved into some of his more controversial claims. He referred to Sean Hannity as evidence to support his claims about the Iraq War.\n\nClinton consistently appeared poised and attacked with methodical precision. The most effective part of Clinton's attacks was to connect him to a kind of trickle-down economics and raise questions about his business record. Clinton's best moments came when she attacked him on birtherism. In the final half hour, Trump was mired deep in his Trumpian statements about women's looks and more.\n\nBut Clinton's greatest advantage remains the dynamics of the Electoral College and the continued doubts about his capacity to be president. It is very hard for a single debate to change the game. And it is unclear that this debate had the kind of dramatic moment that will fundamentally reshape public opinion -- overwhelming all of the other factors that have caused her lead to shrink. The most unfavorable moments for Trump are not worse than anything he's done before -- and those moments have not undercut his campaign thus far.\n\nHaroon Moghul: Trump lost, but so did all of us\n\nHaroon Moghul\n\nNear the end of Monday night's debate, Hillary Clinton looked straight into the camera to address America's allies. She wanted our friends and partners in NATO, and allies like Japan, South Korea, and others to know that we meant to honor our obligations. In that moment, Donald Trump entirely disappeared, and Clinton no longer looked like a candidate for President. She sounded like she was already President.\n\nTrump? He managed to incorporate his very large portfolio into nearly every comment he made. Eventually I expected him to announce he knew best how to defeat ISIS because he built a hotel in Mosul. So, yes, Trump lost. But we lost, too. All of us, as Americans. It's a disaster for any democracy when there is only one responsible candidate running for office, let alone the highest in any land.\n\nTrump's language over the campaign has been racist and authoritarian; he has indulged anti-Semites and winked at white supremacists when he was not busy with plans for mass deportations or Islamophobic bans. It's not a good thing that 100 million people are watching these two candidates debate, because 100 million people shouldn't take a would-be fascist seriously enough to debate his case for the White House.\n\nOne of my favorite new shows is Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\" Unfortunately, we're the ones living in the upside down.\n\nHaroon Moghul is a senior fellow and director of development at the Center for Global Policy. His next book, \"How to be a Muslim,\" will be out in 2017.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat: Clinton won hands down\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat\n\nCivility went south fast in Monday's debate. Donald Trump lost his composure early, ranting, interrupting (over 20 times) and sniffing. (Under the weather, or out of his comfort zone?) Hillary Clinton started out soft, playing the grandmother card, but quickly escalated to tough talk and occasional sarcasm. It could hardly have gone otherwise. Clinton hit hard at Trump, bringing up his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, his \"long record of engaging in racist behavior,\" his denial at having supported the Iraq war, and his refusal to allow the American people to see his tax returns.\n\nIn doing so, Clinton did Americans a big favor: she revealed Trump's limitations. He is simply unable to make those leaps of imagination and generosity necessary to transform from a businessperson to a national political leader. The candidate who claims to do everything big showed the smallness of his thinking tonight. With his off-key rejoinders, he demonstrated repeatedly how he sees everything -- people, properties, cities, and entire countries -- in terms of how they factor into his business and personal universe, which seem to be one and the same. I'll get to Pennsylvania Avenue one way or another, he said tonight, as though the White House and his new Trump hotel are entities of equal importance. Perhaps they really are, in his mind.\n\nClinton alone demonstrated the composure, wisdom, and broad vision necessary for executive office. She won the debate hands down.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, a specialist in 20th-century European history and a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion. Her latest book is \"Italian Fascism's Empire Cinema.\" She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency.\n\nRaul Reyes: A sad night for 'Sniffles'\n\nRaul Reyes\n\nThe reality TV star and businessman who loves giving nicknames earned himself one tonight: \"Sniffles.\" From the beginning through the end of the first debate Donald Trump seemed to have something going on with his sinuses. It seemed a fitting metaphor for a night on which the usual expert showman was seriously off his game. Besides the sniffles, Trump made faces and sighed. He scowled. He interrupted. He took innumerable drinks of water, something for which he used to mock Marco Rubio.\n\nIn so doing, Trump lost this debate to a clearly up-to-the-task Hillary Clinton. Either Trump failed to prepare, or his prep sessions did not stick.\n\nJUST WATCHED The first presidential debate in under 2 minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The first presidential debate in under 2 minutes 01:57\n\nThis is a debate that will likely be studied in college communications, advertising, and gender courses for years to come. Without the benefit of a live audience cheering his one-liners, Trump seemed deflated and not on his best form at all. His constant interruptions of Clinton will do him no favors with women voters. His bragging, in effect, about forcing President Barack Obama to produce his birth certificate will not go over well with black voters. And his rambling answers at times descended into incoherence. In response to a question about cybersecurity, he mentioned that cyberattacks could be coming from \"someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds.\" Uh, what?\n\nClinton did not let opportunities go by to score points with independents or moderate voters, reminding viewers that Trump once saw the mortgage crisis as a business opportunity, and she discussed race relations in thoughtful terms. Meanwhile, Trump made truly bizarre statements, such as she has been been fighting ISIS for 30 years! and \"African-Americans and Hispanics are living in hell, you walk down the streets, you get shot.\" Note to Trump: Testiness is not a presidential look.\n\nJUST WATCHED Debate reality check: Does 'stop and frisk' stop crime?

As Trump might say: \"Sad.\"\n\nUnusual omissions tonight: No mentions of Trump's feuds with everyone from a distinguished Mexican-American judge to a Gold Star family. More glaringly: no discussion of immigration.\n\nWhether viewers agree with Clinton's positions or not, she was able to articulate them in a reasonable and rational manner. She did well, and she knew it. She was obviously ready to discuss problematic issues like her emails. The grin on her face near the end of the debate was evidence that she was aware that she had had a great night. Once you've traveled the world, negotiated treaties, and testified before Congress for 11 hours, she said to Trump with a hint of mockery, then \"you can talk to me about stamina.\" Mic drop.

Has there been a prior event in which a candidate has so completely and remarkably demonstrated his unfitness for the presidency, in character, temperament, preparation and aptitude?\n\nDonald Trump's now-familiar pattern of winning debates through sheer bluster and braggadocio was effective when he was facing a gaggle of opponents, all of whom had similar ideologies but less exaggerated stage personas. But faced with a single rival with clearly distinct ideas and experience and a staunchly unflappable attitude, he seemed rude, ignorant, volatile and churlish. Despite pundit assertions that Hillary Clinton had the burden of proof in this debate, the truth is that she simply needed to hold strong and let Hurricane Trump blow itself out. And she did.\n\nJUST WATCHED 5 times Donald Trump was live fact-checked Replay More Videos ...

Big time.\n\nAdmittedly, to many observers, the train was already way off track. Maybe it started the moment his campaign began, when he dismissed Mexican immigrants as \"rapists.\" Or maybe it was when he attacked Sen. John McCain. Or later, when he attacked a Gold Star family. Certainly, many Americans have paid attention to the media's attempts at fact checking -- including one report that Trump only tells the truth 22% of the time, and another that found in five hours of talking, Trump outright lied an average of every 3 minutes and 15 seconds\n\nJUST WATCHED Poll: Clinton wins first debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Poll: Clinton wins first debate 00:49\n\nBut for those who somehow thought, up until Monday night, that Donald Trump might somehow be qualified to be president, Monday's debate was a wakeup call. He seemed like a defensive, petulant bully who could only insult Hillary Clinton and America -- and couldn't offer a single solution, let alone details. He came across as not only dreadfully unprepared for the debate, but dreadfully unprepared to be president. Which is the truth. And it's high time all Americans know it.\n\nBut don't believe me. I'm obviously biased. Believe Frank Luntz. In his live focus group of undecided and leaning voters, just six people thought Trump won while 16 said Clinton was the victor. In moment after moment, the focus group preferred Clinton. For instance, Clinton's response to Trump's attack on her stamina scored better than Trump's attack. And Hillary's plan to defeat ISIS actually scored better with the Trump leaners in the group than with the Clinton leaners.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump speaks out on taxes, birther movement Replay More Videos ...

Trump definitely took a more staid and steadied approach, but it didn't work. His bravado and charm were largely absent from the stage. Trump the showman can dance around policy pitfalls and distract from some of his less than successful business dealings. Sedate Donald had far fewer tools at his disposal, and looked like he couldn't wait for the 90-minute snooze-fest to end.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: I'm 'smart' for paying no taxes Replay More Videos ...

Trump came into this debate attempting to appeal to a broader audience, so he needed to leave behind the showmanship and bravado that worked for him in the primary and instead carry himself with presidential composure. But his calm voice lasted only 20 minutes and his listening face made him look more like Grumpy Cat than a leader, showing that rehearsed moves just don't work for him.\n\nTrump had Clinton momentarily against the ropes early on about NAFTA and TPP, but then he allowed his emotion to take over and did not regain his own footing for the remainder of the debate. His heavy handed depictions of America's problems didn't hold up against Hillary's detailed, solution oriented answers. His snorting asides were countered with some surprising zingers from Hillary -- \"Donald criticized me for preparing for this debate. You know what else I prepared for? To be President.\"\n\nTrump crumbled under Hillary's attacks on his business record, lack of transparency on taxes, and understanding of African-American communities. By the time it came around to national security, the contrast in experience was even more clear, with Clinton nimbly moving around the globe and Trump invoking his 10-year-old son--who, he told us, is good at computers -- in a discussion of cyber security. Trump's abrupt defensiveness, especially on the issue of his temperament, allowed Clinton to come across as the champion of those who have been taken taken advantage of by big business and systemic racism.

    "text": "Story highlights Orlando mass killing fits grim pattern of homegrown terrorism, writes Peter Bergen\n\nSince 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes\n\nPeter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.\"\n\n(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.\n\nBecause 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.\n\nBut Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.\n\nIn fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.\n\nIn other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) From Australia to the Caribbean, there's no shortage of beautiful beachfront hotels around the world to choose from.\n\nBut some are, quite simply, more beautiful than others.\n\nWhether you're after a glitzy, all-inclusive resort or a low-key island hideaway, we've picked 21 of the world's most stunning.\n\nSoneva Kiri (Koh Kood, Thailand)\n\nThe Soneva resort has an open-air cinema set above a lagoon.\n\nSituated on the island of Koh Kood -- just off the coast of Bangkok -- Soneva Kiri is one of Thailand's most luxurious and exclusive beachfront escapes.\n\nThe resort, wedged between the jungle and the ocean, features just 36 thatched villas made out of sustainably sourced wood and recycled materials.\n\nEach villa has its own private infinity pool, sundeck and a lavish indoor-outdoor bathroom.\n\nThe resort's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance? Its jungle-enshrouded Cinema Paradiso, an open-air movie theater set above a lagoon that screens films nightly.\n\nSoneva Kiri Thailand, 110 Moo 4, Ko Kut Thailand;\n\nLe Guanahani (Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy)\n\nFresh from a four-year, $40 million renovation, this classic St. Barth resort -- located on its own private peninsula -- is more beautiful and extravagant than ever.\n\nIts newly revamped guest cottages are painted in bright shades of turquoise and buttercup yellow, and feature plush, modern colonial furnishings.\n\nAll rooms have spacious terraces and many feature their own swimming pool and private tropical garden.\n\nProperty highlights include two pools, two white sand beaches and a reef-protected lagoon.\n\nLe Guanahani, Grand Cul-de-sac, 97133 St. Barthelemy;\n\nHotel Fasano (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)\n\nLocated at the tip of Rio's legendary Ipanema Beach, Hotel Fasano has views that alone are worth the trip.\n\nFrom its luxurious rooftop infinity pool, guests can admire the entire expanse of Ipanema and the distinctive Morro Dois Irmaos and Corcovado mountains.\n\nThe hotel itself is as impressive as its location: it was co-designed by Philippe Starck and blends a contemporary aesthetic with quirky retro touches.\n\nIts 79 rooms and 10 suites follow suit, mixing the ultramodern with the eclectic (think ear-shaped mirrors and colorful Sergio Rodrigues loungers).\n\nHotel Fasano Rio de Janeiro, Avenida Vieira Souto 80 Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro 22420-002 Brazil;\n\nHotel du Palais (Biarritz, France)\n\nNapoleon III built this lavish venue in France's glitzy Atlantic resort town as a gift for his wife Eug\u00e9nie in 1855.\n\nIt still channels the same Old World grandeur it did back then with its seemingly endless marble, crystal chandeliers and plush d\u00e9cor.\n\nIts 153 rooms and suites are similarly sumptuous, crammed with antiques and richly embroidered fabrics.\n\nBut the best thing about the property is its location, perched above the windswept Grande Plage -- steps from not one but two beautiful beaches.\n\nHotel du Palais, 1 Avenue de L'Imperatrice, 64200 Biarritz France;\n\nFour Seasons Resort The Biltmore (California)\n\nFour Seasons Resort The Biltmore neighbors the star-studded Coral Casino Beach Club.\n\nSet upon a secluded stretch of the Santa Barbara coastline -- AKA the American Riviera -- this classic resort is the ultimate beachfront hideaway.\n\nIts Spanish Colonial bungalows are hidden amidst a sprawling 22-acre garden oasis, filled with 2,000 species of tropical plants and palms.\n\nOriginal Spanish artwork, hand-painted Andalusian tiles and handcrafted walnut furnishings can be found throughout the resort.\n\nProperty highlights include a palm tree-flanked garden pool and the adjacent Coral Casino Beach Club -- an infamous Hollywood hangout accessible only to select room categories.\n\nFour Seasons Resort The Biltmore Santa Barbara, 1260 Channel Drive, Santa Barbara, CA 93108-2805;\n\nInterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort (Danang, Vietnam)\n\nDesigned by famed luxury hotel architect Bill Bensley, this beachfront resort dazzles from the outset: its temple-inspired villas cascade dramatically down a lush mountainside into the ocean.\n\nIts 197 rooms and suites are just as striking -- even entry-level suites are outfitted with sprawling terraces and spa-like bathrooms with ocean-facing tubs.\n\nEverything in the resort begs to be photographed, from the eclectic dining areas (at Citron restaurant, guests can dine in a cone suspended over the mountain) to the palm-fringed white sand beach.\n\nBut most Instagram-worthy of all is the resort's Long Pool: an adults-only infinity pool overlooking the entire resort and Son Tra Peninsula.\n\nInterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort, Bai Bac, Sontra Peninsula, Da Nang Vietnam;\n\nW Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain)\n\nIt doesn't get much cooler than this towering, shimmering, sail-shaped hotel.\n\nDesigned by world-renowned architect Ricardo Bofill, Barcelona's most distinctive hotel is as sleek and as chic as its ultra hip, A-list clientele.\n\nIts 437 rooms and suites are decorated in shades of pale gold and turquoise, designed to reflect the sea and sand.\n\nNot that guests will need to be reminded what the sea and sand look like: the hotel sits right on the water's edge and is the only hotel in Barcelona to offer guests direct beach access.\n\nW Barcelona, Placa de la Rosa dels Vents, 1, 08039 Barcelona Spain;\n\nRockhouse Hotel (Negril, Jamaica)\n\nRockhouse Hotel is just a few minutes away from the silky shore of Seven Mile Beach.\n\nNegril isn't a typical beach destination: the beaches here are rocky rather than sandy, and jut out dramatically into the turquoise ocean.\n\nBut they do make a spectacular backdrop for this unique boutique hotel, which sits amid shoreline jungle by the sea on Negril's West End.\n\nIts 20 thatched-roof villas, made entirely out of stone and timber, have private sunbathing decks perched directly over water.\n\nGuests are unlikely to miss the sand, but just in case, the silky shores of Seven Mile Beach are just a few minutes away.\n\nRockhouse Hotel, West End Rd, Negril Jamaica;\n\nThe St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort (Rio Grande, Puerto Rico)\n\nThe luxury hotel brand clearly went for the \"go big or go home\" approach when building its first Caribbean property.\n\nThe resort -- sprawled across a whopping 483 acres near El Yunque National Forest -- has its own private beach, bird sanctuary and 18-hole oceanfront golf course.\n\nThere's also a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant on site and one of the world's best spas.\n\nRooms, not surprisingly, are also large and impressive, with soaring wood-beamed ceilings and enormous beach-facing terraces.\n\nThe St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort, State Road 187 kilometer 4.2, Rio Grande 00745 Puerto Rico;\n\nEl Nido Pangulasian Island (Palawan, Philippines)\n\nThis private island resort is the most luxurious of El Nido Resorts' four Palawan archipelago properties.\n\nIts 42 palm-thatched villas are sprawled along a white sand cove facing the emerald waters of Bacuit Bay in the South China Sea.\n\nVillas are decked out in modern Filipino decor -- coffee-colored textiles, rattan furniture and local art -- and boast large private balconies.\n\nProperty highlights include a sleek oceanfront infinity pool (though many villas have their own) and a thatched-roof spa with an open-air relaxation lounge.\n\nEl Nido Resorts Pangulasian Island, Bacuit Bay, El Nido, Palawan Island Philippines;\n\nBelmond Villa Sant'Andrea (Sicily, Italy)\n\nSet among beautiful gardens on its own private beach on the Bay of Mazzar\u00f2, Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea is Sicily's loveliest seaside getaway.\n\nOriginally built in 1830 as a private villa, the hotel blends classic Italian elegance with splashes of bright color, contemporary art and ultra luxurious amenities.\n\nSuites are unapologetically lavish, outfitted with Carrara marble, rich silks and large furnished balconies.\n\nAdded bonus: its signature restaurant, Oliviero, is one of the island's prettiest al fresco dining spots.\n\nBelmond Villa Sant'Andrea, Via Nazionale 137, 98039 Mazzaro, Taormina, Sicily Italy;\n\nSoneva Fushi (Maldives)\n\nSoneva Fushi: The original Maldivian getaway.\n\nOpened in 1995, Soneva Fushi Resort is the original Maldivian island getaway and remains one of the best today.\n\nVillas are tucked away amid dense foliage and are located steps from a white sand beach and UNESCO-protected coral reef.\n\nTheir indoor-outdoor floor plan and upscale island interiors -- think thatched roofs and coconut wood furnishings -- complement the resort's castaway-chic vibe.\n\nBut luxury comes at a price: upward of $1,500-a-night for a villa in high season.\n\nSoneva Fushi Resort, 2233;\n\nSecret Bay (Dominica, West Indies)\n\nTucked away on the unspoiled and relatively unknown island of Dominica, this hotel, as its name suggests, is one of the Caribbean's best-kept secrets.\n\nIt has only six villas and bungalows nestled on a hillside above a deserted stretch of pristine white-sand coast.\n\nThe treehouse-style villas, made of sustainably sourced Guyanese hardwood, are decadently large and outfitted with hammocks, terraces and plunge pools.\n\nAdded bonus? They're eco-friendly, outfitted with low-energy lighting and water-saving drip irrigation systems.\n\nSecret Bay, Portsmouth 00109-8000 Dominica;\n\nQualia (Great Barrier Reef, Australia)\n\nSited at the secluded northernmost tip of Hamilton Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Qualia is an escapist's dream resort.\n\nEach of its 60 timber-and-glass villas is hidden perfectly amid the tropical, eucalypt-filled landscape.\n\nMany are packed with luxurious amenities like private pools and sundecks, but even those without are blessed with legendary views over the Whitsunday Islands.\n\nOther property highlights include two infinity pools and a beautiful al fresco dining pavilion -- the perfect spot to watch the sun set over the reef.\n\nQualia Resort, 20 Whitsunday Boulevard, 4803 Australia;\n\nFour Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea (Hawaii)\n\nThe resort's beach-facing infinity pool boasts an underwater music system and a swim-up bar.\n\nThough beautiful resorts in Hawaii are a dime a dozen, the Four Seasons at Wailea may just trump them all.\n\nBuilt on 15 acres on Maui's southern coast, the resort is in the shape of a horseshoe to ensure optimal views of the Pacific from almost every suite.\n\nLodgings are bright and breezy, outfitted with traditional, handmade koa furniture and roomy lanais (terraces).\n\nBut what folks are really here for is the adults-only infinity pool: it's got an underwater music system, swim-up bar and unrivaled views over Wailea Beach.\n\nFour Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, 3900 Wailea Alanui Drive, Wailea, Maui, HI 96753-5453;\n\nBela Vista Hotel & Spa (Algarve, Portugal)\n\nLocated on the beachfront at Praia da Rocha, Bela Vista was the first hotel to open on the Algarve, back in 1934.\n\nThough it's since been joined by dozens of other high-end lodgings, its eclectic charm and intimate boutique feel keeps it above the rest.\n\nThe hotel's original decor -- painted wooden ceilings and colorful wall mosaics -- has been kept intact through a recent refurbishment, which has updated the property with chic modern furnishings.\n\nAll 38 rooms are individually designed and decorated, and most have balconies with views over Praia da Rocha.\n\nBELA VISTA Hotel & SPA, Avenida Tomas Cabreira, Praia da Rocha, Portimao 8500-802 Portugal;\n\nThe Mulia (Bali, Indonesia)\n\nEverything about The Mulia is dramatic, from its Nusa Dua beachfront setting to its sheer size (the resort spans nearly 75 acres).\n\nIt's so large, in fact, that it's home to two separate properties: The traditional Mulia Resort and the Mulia Villas -- 108 standalone luxury villas outfitted with private pools and sprawling, indoor-outdoor bathrooms.\n\nRooms at the main resort are decadent too, with gold-and-cream living spaces that flow through to grand bedrooms and spa-sized bathrooms with deep-soaking tubs.\n\nOutside, an infinity pool flanked by towering Balinese stone maidens is located mere steps from the beach.\n\nThe Mulia, Jl. Raya Nusa Dua Selatan Kawasan Sawangan, Nusa Dua 80363 Indonesia;\n\nCap Juluca (Anguilla)\n\nThis intimate boutique hotel, situated on 179 acres on Anguilla's Maundays Bay, is a longtime Caribbean favorite.\n\nIts domed, Moorish-style villas -- set upon miles of powder-white sand -- are decorated thoughtfully with colorful batiks, rattan furniture and coconut wood accents.\n\nThough the vibe is beachy and low-key, rooms abound with posh amenities like plush Frette linens and Herm\u00e8s bath products.\n\nAdded bonus: every room is beachfront and has an ocean-facing patio.\n\nCap Juluca, Maundays Bay, West End Village AI - 2640 Anguilla;\n\nThe Resort at Pedregal (Cabo San Lucas, Mexico)\n\nThe Resort at Pedregal's beautiful and spacious rooms have impressive sea views.\n\nSandwiched between the mountains and ocean on the southernmost tip of Mexico's Baja Peninsula, this Spanish Colonial resort has the best address in Cabo San Lucas.\n\nRooms are huge and beautiful, decorated with Mexican art and outfitted with fireplaces, terraces and plunge pools.\n\nThough the resort is directly on the beachfront and every room has a pool, there are four additional pools onsite -- including a swim-up bar steps from the ocean.\n\nIts signature restaurant, El Farallon, offers clifftop dining and some of the best seafood in Los Cabos.\n\nThe Resort at Pedregal, Camino Del Mar 1, Cabo San Lucas 23455 Mexico;\n\nFour Seasons Resort Bora Bora (Bora Bora, French Polynesia)\n\nOpened in 2008, the Four Seasons is Bora Bora's newest resort and arguably its most beautiful.\n\nIt's made up of 100 overwater, thatched-roof bungalows that stretch out over an emerald lagoon, several of which have their own private pools.\n\nFor those who prefer to stay on land, there's a handful of spacious villas strung along a white sand beach.\n\nThere's also a cathedral-like spa and a large infinity pool flanked by chic teak loungers and thatched cabanas.\n\nFour Seasons Resort Bora Bora, Motu Tehotu BP 547, 98730 French Polynesia;\n\nThe Setai (Miami, USA)\n\nWith its sleek facade and high-rise appeal, the Setai feels more like a hip urban hotel than a beachfront resort -- a refreshing contrast from its garish, candy-colored South Beach neighbors.\n\nInside can be found a striking Art Deco-meets-Eastern aesthetic: slate-colored marble, teak accents and Asian artwork.\n\nSuites are similarly zen and feature enormous handmade Swedish wooden beds and sumptuous black granite soaking tubs.\n\nOutside are three stunning pools -- heated at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, 85 degrees and 90 degrees respectively -- located steps from South Beach.",

But I think, more importantly than that, people make mistakes doing interviews. Look at his point of view on issues like the environment, on climate change, on the economy. And I think, if any of the people voted for me take a hard look what he stands for, I think - and understand where he's coming from, they will not be supporting - not be supporting him.\n\nSanders on The New York Times report that Trump has not paid federal income taxes for 18 years: Let me get your reaction to this news about Donald Trump and not paying federal income taxes. Some Trump supporters would argue, why should he pay any more taxes than the law requires him to. What do you think? SANDERS: Well, you know, Jake, this is exactly why so many millions of Americans are frustrated, they are angry, they are disgusted at what they see is a corrupt political system in this country\u2026 So, Trump goes around and says, hey, I'm worth billions, I'm a successful businessman, but I don't pay any taxes. But, you, you make 15 bucks an hour, you pay the taxes, not me. That's why people are angry and want real change in this country.\n\nSanders on Clinton's hacked audio calling him a \"false promise\": TAPPER:\u2026What was your reaction when you heard that, calling your ideas indefensible, saying that you were selling them false promises? SANDERS: Well, two things. If you listen to the whole discussion that she had, a very important point that she made is that a lot of young people who went into debt, worked very hard to get a good education get out of school and can't find jobs commensurate with the education that they received. And there's a lot of unhappiness about young people. And this is an issue that we must address. But the bottom line here is that I think that what Secretary Clinton and I have done since the election, since the primary nominating process, we have worked together in a number of areas\u2026And, by the way, apropos to Donald Trump not paying any taxes, she's come up with an estate tax proposal which will ask the very wealthiest people in this country, wealthiest families in this country to start paying their fair share. TAPPER: Yes. I get that, Senator. But she's calling other ideas you pitched, not the ones that you two are working on together, but she called other ones false promises and said what you were doing was indefensible. That must bother you. SANDERS: Well, look, we're - of course it does. But we're in the middle of a campaign. And I - trust me. If you go to some of the statements that I made about Hillary Clinton, you can see real differences. So we have differences. There's nothing to be surprised about. That's what a campaign is all about.\n\nSanders on audio from The Washington Free Beacon of Clinton describing his supporters: (AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON: Some are new to politics completely. They are children of the great recession, and they are living in their parents' basement. So, if you're feeling that you're consigned to being a barista or, you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot and doesn't have much of a ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. TAPPER: What was your reaction to that, sir? SANDERS: Well, I agree with her. What she's saying is what I suggested a moment ago. There are young people who went deeply into debt, worked very hard to get a good education, and yet they are getting out of school and they can't find decent-paying jobs. And that's a major problem. They are living in their parents' basements. And that's the point there. So, I personally do believe we do need a political revolution, that we do need to transform the society, create decent-paying jobs, make sure that Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change, transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, and have pay equity for women. So, I think that Secretary Clinton - and, by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago - she's prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration\u2026 TAPPER: Senator, what would you say to a Bernie Sanders supporter who listens to that tape and thinks, that sounds condescending, to call me a basement-dwelling barista that's buying false promises from Bernie Sanders, and I think she's just using Bernie Sanders to get elected? What is your message to that Bernie Sanders supporter? SANDERS: This is what the message would be. Take a hard look, not at Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Take a hard look at the needs of the American people. And issue by issue, whether it is climate change, whether it is Citizens United, the need to overturn that, whether it is pay equity for women, whether it is raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, a tax system that says to Trump and his friends they are going start paying their fair share of taxes, look at Clinton's positions, look at Trump's positions, understand that one or the other of those two will be the next president of the United States. And after you take a hard look at those two candidates and their issues, I think the conclusion that the vast majority of people will reach is that Clinton is far and away the superior candidate.\n\nSanders on Deutsche Bank\u2019s $14 billion fine for its mortgage-lending activities: TAPPER: \u2026As you may know, the Clintons received almost a million dollars from Deutsche Bank for delivering four speeches behind closed doors. In light of the fine and the ongoing investigation, should they return that money? SANDERS: Well, that's for them to decide. But what this tells me and what this whole Wells Fargo fiasco tells me, Jake, is what I have been saying all along, is that the business model of the largest financial institutions in this country and, in fact, around the world is fraud. It is fraud. That's what they do. Occasionally, they get caught after making huge amounts of money. And that's I believe why we need to reestablish Glass-Steagall legislation and why I believe we need to break up these large financial institutions. We cannot continue to tolerate, whether it's Deutsche Bank, whether it's Wells Fargo, whether it's Bank of America, the kind of fraudulent activity that we have seen for so long.\n\nFULL TRANSCRIPT\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, D.C., where the state of our union is taxed.\n\nOvernight, \"The New York Times\" publishing a copy of Donald Trump's 1995 tax returns, or at least some pages from it, revealing a $916 million loss from failed business projects. The law would allow him, theoretically, to use those losses to offset taxes on new income for as long as 18 years, \"The Times\" report.\n\nSo, did Donald Trump pay any federal income taxes? His campaign's response - quote - \"Mr. Trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes\" - unquote.\n\nThat statement, you might notice, does not mention paying income taxes or dispute the authenticity of \"The Times\"-obtained document. But they do say it was illegally obtained.\n\nJoining me now is former presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is a supporter of Hillary Clinton.\n\nSenator Sanders, good to see you, as always.\n\nLet me get your reaction to this news about Donald Trump and not paying federal income taxes. Some Trump supporters would argue, why should he pay any more taxes than the law requires him to. What do you think?\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Well, you know, Jake, this is exactly why so many millions of Americans are frustrated, they are angry, they are disgusted at what they see is a corrupt political system in this country.\n\nSo, what you have, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, in the last 16 years, we have seen a 10-fold increase in the number of billionaires. And at the same time, many of these billionaires have loopholes that their lobbyists and their friends on Capitol Hill provide to them which enable them to avoid taxes, in some cases, not paying a nickel in taxes.\n\nSo, you have got the middle-class people working longer hours for low wages. They pay their taxes. They support their schools. They support their infrastructure. They support the military. But the billionaires, no, they don't have to do that, because they have their friends on Capitol Hill. They pay zero in taxes.\n\nSo, Trump goes around and says, hey, I'm worth billions, I'm a successful businessman, but I don't pay any taxes. But, you, you make 15 bucks an hour, you pay the taxes, not me.\n\nThat's why people are angry and want real change in this country.\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk about that.\n\nYou hit the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton this week to promote your new joint college plan.\n\nTake a listen what Hillary Clinton said about you and your supporters back in February when she was at a closed door fund-raiser. I want to make it clear this is just an excerpt of these comments. And it came from an e-mail hack. Take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nHILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's just a deep desire to believe that, you know, we can have free college, free health care.\n\nIt's a false promise. But I don't think you tell idealistic people, particularly young people, that they bought into a false promise.\n\nHis ideas are indefensible.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: You are out there working very, very hard for Secretary Clinton, trying convince your supporters to back someone that many of them did not trust.\n\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that, calling your ideas indefensible, saying that you were selling them false promises?\n\nSANDERS: Well, two things.\n\nIf you listen to the whole discussion that she had, a very important point that she made is that a lot of young people who went into debt, worked very hard to get a good education get out of school and can't find jobs commensurate with the education that they received.\n\nAnd there's a lot of unhappiness about young people. And this is an issue that we must address. But the bottom line here is that I think that what Secretary Clinton and I have done since the election, since the primary nominating process, we have worked together in a number of areas.\n\nSecretary Clinton has worked with me to make certain that public colleges and universities become tuition-free for all families earning $125,000 or less, that we double funding for community health centers, which means that we will have access to primary care for millions more Americans.\n\nAnd, by the way, apropos to Donald Trump not paying any taxes, she's come up with an estate tax proposal which will ask the very wealthiest people in this country, wealthiest families in this country to start paying their fair share.\n\nTAPPER: Yes. I get that, Senator. But she's calling other ideas you pitched, not the ones that you two are working on together, but she called other ones false promises and said what you were doing was indefensible. That must bother you.\n\nSANDERS: Well, look, we're - of course it does.\n\nBut we're in the middle of a campaign. And I - trust me. If you go to some of the statements that I made about Hillary Clinton, you can see real differences. So we have differences. There's nothing to be surprised about. That's what a campaign is all about.\n\nTAPPER: She also said this about your supporters. And let me also remind people you should go and listen - go to \"The Washington Free Beacon\" Web site. They have the whole comments. You should listen to them all. But she said this about your supporters.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON: Some are new to politics completely. They are children of the great recession, and they are living in their parents' basement.\n\nSo, if you're feeling that you're consigned to being a barista or, you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot and doesn't have much of a ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: What was your reaction to that, sir?\n\nSANDERS: Well, I agree with her.\n\nWhat she's saying is what I suggested a moment ago.

And that's the point there.\n\nSo, I personally do believe we do need a political revolution, that we do need to transform the society, create decent-paying jobs, make sure that Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change, transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, and have pay equity for women.\n\nSo, I think that Secretary Clinton - and, by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago - she's prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration.\n\nAnd, on top of that, unlike Donald Trump, she understands that Citizens United Supreme Court decision is undermining American democracy. It has got to be overturned. She will be supporting a constitutional amendment to do that, so that billionaires cannot continue buying elections in this country.\n\nTAPPER: Senator, what would you say to a Bernie Sanders supporter who listens to that tape and thinks, that sounds condescending, to call me a basement-dwelling barista that's buying false promises from Bernie Sanders, and I think she's just using Bernie Sanders to get elected?\n\nWhat is your message to that Bernie Sanders supporter?\n\nSANDERS: This is what the message would be.\n\nTake a hard look, not at Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Take a hard look at the needs of the American people. And issue by issue, whether it is climate change, whether it is Citizens United, the need to overturn that, whether it is pay equity for women, whether it is raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, a tax system that says to Trump and his friends they are going start paying their fair share of taxes, look at Clinton's positions, look at Trump's positions, understand that one or the other of those two will be the next president of the United States.\n\nAnd after you take a hard look at those two candidates and their issues, I think the conclusion that the vast majority of people will reach is that Clinton is far and away the superior candidate.\n\nTAPPER: A lot of Clinton advisers are worried, as I'm sure you know, that a sizable number of your former supporters might go to a third-party candidate such as Jill Stein or Gary Johnson.\n\nGary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, struggled this week to name a foreign world leader whom he respects.\n\nTake a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: Who is your favorite foreign leader?\n\nGARY JOHNSON, LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Who is my favorite...\n\nMATTHEWS: Any - just name anywhere in the country - any one of the continents, any country. Name one foreign leader that you respect and look up to.\n\nYou have got to do this. Anywhere. Any continent, Canada, Mexico, Europe over there, Asia, South America, Africa. Name a foreign leader that you respect.\n\nJOHNSON: I guess I'm having an Aleppo moment. The former president of Mexico...\n\nMATTHEWS: No. Which one?\n\nJOHNSON: I'm having a brain - I'm having a brain...\n\nMATTHEWS: Well, name anybody.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: I know you disagree with Gary Johnson on a range of policy issues, where you and Secretary Clinton agree. Do you think he's qualified to be president?\n\nSANDERS: You know, that wasn't the most impressive interview I have ever heard.\n\nBut I think, more importantly than that, people make mistakes doing interviews. Look at his point of view on issues like the environment, on climate change, on the economy. And I think, if any of the people voted for me take a hard look what he stands for, I think - and understand where he's coming from, they will not be supporting - not be supporting him.\n\nTAPPER: I want to ask you about Deutsche Bank.\n\nObviously, as you know, two weeks ago federal regulators slapped Deutsche Bank with a $14 billion fine for its mortgage-lending activities during the housing bubble between 2012 and 2014.\n\nAs you may know, the Clintons received almost a million dollars from Deutsche Bank for delivering four speeches behind closed doors. In light of the fine and the ongoing investigation, should they return that money?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that's for them to decide.\n\nBut what this tells me and what this whole Wells Fargo fiasco tells me, Jake, is what I have been saying all along, is that the business model of the largest financial institutions in this country and, in fact, around the world is fraud. It is fraud.\n\nThat's what they do. Occasionally, they get caught after making huge amounts of money. And that's I believe why we need to reestablish Glass-Steagall legislation and why I believe we need to break up these large financial institutions. We cannot continue to tolerate, whether it's Deutsche Bank, whether it's Wells Fargo, whether it's Bank of America, the kind of fraudulent activity that we have seen for so long.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, sir, you were critical of the Clinton Foundation taking money from governments like Saudi Arabia during the primaries.\n\nThere's still talk of the Clinton Foundation continuing even if Secretary Clinton becomes elected president. Chelsea Clinton is planning to stay on board.\n\nDo you think that that poses a potential conflict of interests, and should the Clinton Foundation shut down if Secretary Clinton becomes president?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that's obviously something that the Clinton family is going to have to determine. But I think it does raise serious questions if foreign governments, for example, are making contributions to a foundation tied closely to what I hope will be - who I hope will be the next president of the United States.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Bernie Sanders, we always enjoy having you on. Thank you so much. Happy new year to you, sir.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\n###END INTERVIEW###",

I strongly believe people should look like what they look like,\" she says.\n\n\"Does that mean that stuff isn't done? There isn't a (magazine) cover that goes out where stuff isn't done.\"\n\nLeibovitz may have been quick to embrace digital photography, but it turns out she's not as quick with social media, saying she's too busy to join photograph-sharing platform Instagram.\n\n\"I've watched Amy Schumer's Instagram and it's brilliant but it's like it's a full time job and I like to do everything well,\" she says, adding that she could one day do everything on Instagram \"when things slow down a little bit.\"\n\nBut don't hold your breath.

With the input that Davis Love had and each vice-captain -- with Tom Lehman and Jim Furyk and Steve Stricker, and Tiger Woods and Bubba Watson -- all brought integral parts to the success of this foundation, and it's important that we build on that.\"\n\nThe United States has not won an away Ryder Cup since Watson's side triumphed at The Belfry in England in 1993. The 2018 edition takes place at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.\n\n\"For us to go to Europe and try to win the Cup is a whole different feat,\" Mickelson added. \"That's going to require a whole different level of play, of solidarity, of fortitude, and we are going to have to build on this in two years if we want to try to retain the Cup.\n\n\"It's great that we had success this week, but it's not about one year or one Ryder Cup. It's about a multitude, for decades to come.\"\n\nAll 12 US players won at least a point for the first time since 1975.\n\nFormer world No. 1 Woods, who will return to tournament golf next week after a year out recuperating from multiple back surgeries, said his experience as a vice-captain has inspired him to lead his country one day.\n\n\"Seeing what our captain went through, that's hard,\" said Woods, who has played on seven Ryder Cup teams, beginning in 1997 in Spain. \"Yeah, I would love to do it. I would be honored to do it in the future, if asked.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old added: \"As a non-player, it's very complicated. There's a lot of things that I didn't realize that went on, and very eye-opening -- it was a great experience.\n\n\"I learned a lot and I became really close to a lot of these guys, and it's been just an honor to be part of it. The relationships that we've forged here this week and actually before this week, are bonds that will last a lifetime.\n\n\"I love being out there, in the fight with these guys. I was just in the fight a different way and had to do my role and had to my job in a different way, and it was pretty cool.\"\n\nTiger Woods (back left) was a vice-captain alongside Bubba Watson.\n\nTwo-time Masters champion Bubba Watson, who was a late appointee as a vice-captain after not doing enough to make the team, added: \"And I have Tiger's cellphone number now, yes. I'm going to text you all the time.\"\n\nThe US task force looked in detail at every aspect of the Ryder Cup and tried to learn lessons from Europe's winning blueprint.\n\nIt appointed Love as a steady hand as captain despite his side losing at Medinah in 2012, and instigated small touches such as a predominant \"USA red\" theme in all the signage and grandstands at Hazeltine, revamped the qualification system to allow Love four wildcards, and exploited home advantage by curating a course with little rough for the bigger hitters on their side to escape punishment with wayward shots.\n\nLove also returned to a version of former captain Paul Azinger's \"pod\" system from 2008, when the 12-man team was broken down into smaller units for practice and bonding.\n\nRickie Fowler was without a partner at the Ryder Cup.\n\nAt Hazeltine, Woods' pod included Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth, and the vice-captain was instrumental in persuading Love to keep the successful partnership together, delivering 2\u00bd points out of their four matches.\n\nMuch was made of the behavior of a small minority of unruly fans in Minnesota, fueled by alcohol, partisanship and possibly comments made in an article written by European player Danny Willett's brother Peter.\n\nIn it, drama teacher Peter Willett wrote the American fans were a \"baying mob of imbeciles\" and \"pudgy, basement-dwelling irritants\" among a number of other insults in an attempt at satire.\n\nUSA's Reed beat McIlroy in a sensational singles match on Sunday.\n\nEurope's Rory McIlroy was the target for some personal abuse and asked for one individual to be ejected after a poor-taste comment.\n\n'Positives'\n\nMcIlroy, though, stressed European fans wouldn't be looking for revenge in Paris, other than offering fair but wholehearted home support.\n\n\"We wouldn't encourage any sort of retaliation. That's just not who we are. That's not what we do,\" McIlroy, who lost to Reed in a scintillating singles match Sunday, said at the European team press conference.\n\n\"There won't be -- and we'll be making that clear. We want to play this tournament in the manner in which it should be played. It's just a very small minority; 95% of the people out there, the American gallery are absolutely fantastic, they really are.\"\n\nThe four-time major champion added: \"There are positives to take going into Paris in two years' time. Some of the new blood that we have, they have gotten over their first Ryder Cup and now they know what it's about.\n\n\"Not trying to give anything away here, but that's one of the big parts of our success is that we keep a core group of players and people in the team and around the team.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) It turns out people's top priority in an airport, besides making their flight, is staying hydrated.\n\nDespite the high price of bottled water at the gate, it's the number one item purchased in Hudson's travel essential stores in the United States.\n\nHudson Group is North America's largest travel retailer, with more than 950 stores in airports and transportation terminals.\n\nThe company recently released a list of the top 10 items sold last year and there's a clear winner.\n\nBeverages are king -- taking eight of the 10 slots.\n\nIt helps that airline liquid restrictions have turned thirsty travelers into a captive audience -- once you're past security, there's no other option than to spend.\n\nBottled water is not only number one, it's number one through five -- with Dasani's bottled 20 oz taking first place and Glaceau's Smartwater 23.8 oz coming in fifth.\n\nWhat else do passengers want? Chocolate!\n\nM&M Peanuts to be exact.\n\nThe only non-edible in the top 10 is \"The Wall Street Journal.\"\n\nHere's how it breaks down, by units sold:\n\n1. Dasani bottled water (20 oz)\n\n2. Glaceau Smartwater (20 oz)\n\n3. Large Dasani (one liter)\n\n4. Glaceau Smartwater (one liter)\n\n5. Glaceau Smartwater (23.8 oz)\n\n6. Diet Coke (20 oz)\n\n7. Coca-Cola (20 oz)\n\n8. M&M Peanut king-size\n\n9. Coca-Cola Zero (20 oz)\n\n10. The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe most popular newspapers were \"The Wall Street Journal,\" followed by the \"New York Post,\" \"The New York Times\" and \"USA Today.\"\n\nFavorite magazines were \"US Weekly,\" \"In Touch,\" \"The Economist,\" \"Life & Style,\" \"Star,\" \"Vanity Fair\" and \"OK.\"\n\nTina Fey's \"Bossypants\" topped the list of books, followed by Chris Kyle's \"American Sniper\" and Malcolm Gladwell's \"David and Goliath.\"\n\nTina Fey's \"Bossypants\" was one of two memoirs that topped the books list.\n\nEvolution of newsstands\n\nNewsstands around the world have changed their model after realizing passengers want more than magazines and newspapers -- they want snacks, neck pillows and iPhone chargers, too.\n\nHudson News rebranded its stores in 2014 by dropping \"News\" from the title.\n\nHope Remoundos, chief marketing officer for Hudson, told Skift in April that the intention of the name change was \"to become more travel convenient\" and to emphasize innovations, particularly the expansion of its electronics line.\n\nRemoundos said they noticed \"the panic on the traveler's face when their smart device had no juice, and there were only two or three plugs in the airport for somebody to plug into.\n\n\"Immediately, we added to our selection a line of chargers and [battery packs] so that all you had to do was plug in the power and you were ready to go.\"\n\nTopping the list of Hudson's most expensive items sold is a pair of $1,000 ear buds -- W60 by Westone. Eight people have purchased them to date.\n\nMostly though, people want a bag of Lay's potato chips (number one in the snack category) and a pocket-size pack of Kleenex tissues (number one in the Health category).\n\nThey may be courting the tech-obsessed generation, but their lists show an increased demand for food.\n\n\"We attribute the demand for healthier snacks and beverages to a larger change in consumer perception about wellness, and as a result of the airlines lessening their in-flight meals and snacks,\" Joe DiDomizio, president & CEO of Hudson Group, told CNN.\n\n\"We've adapted by adding alternative beverage selections, such as flavored waters and more juice selections, along with yogurts, fruits and vegetables.\n\n\"We are constantly reviewing products that are gluten-free, non-GMO, whole grain, vegan and high in protein.\"\n\nBut the spine of Hudson and Hudson News' business still lies in books and magazines.\n\n\"Bookstores at airports and train stations are benefiting from a print revival, and this stands true for Hudson Booksellers,\" said DiDomizio.\n\nThis is also consistent with industry-wide trends.\n\nIn fact, the American Booksellers Association counted 1,712 member stores in 2,227 locations in 2015, up from 1,410 in 1,660 locations five years ago.\n\nWestone's W60 ear buds retail at $999.99.\n\nTravel retail: An estimated $60 billion business\n\nAirports have surpassed their function as transportation centers. They're now prime commercial real estate for every travel essential and inessential: from perfumes to jewelry to fashion.\n\nAccording to the Fung Business Intelligence Center, in 2014 the global travel retail market was valued at $63.5 billion. It's estimated to reach $85 billion by 2020.\n\nOver the past 10 years, travel retail has grown at a rate of 8.4% a year.\n\nThis growth has been in tandem with the rapid increase in tourism, largely due to the democratization of affordable air travel.\n\nAccording to the United Nations' World Tourism Organization, international tourist arrivals grew by 4.4% in 2015, reaching a record 1.2 billion travelers.\n\nThe most recent Moodie Report , released last year, listed Swiss-based American-owned Dufry as the world's top travel retailer, with a 2014 turnover of around $5.4 billion.\n\nThe Hudson Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dufry.\n\nIn at second place was luxury retailer DFS (turnover of $4.18 billion), while South Korea's Lotte Duty Free ranked third (turnover of $3.9 billion) -- indicative of Asia being a key growth market for travel retail.",

He is the author of \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) The first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had plenty of energy and substance when it came to issues of the economy and trade, but it did not have enough substance when it came to the key issue of how the president will act as commander in chief.\n\nConsider that the word \"Afghanistan\" went unmentioned, except for Clinton briefly citing the war as an example of NATO cooperation. This is a strange oversight as America's longest war has ground on for a decade and half, while the Taliban are now estimated to control some 30% of the country.\n\nOne of the first things the next president will have to decide is whether to continue to draw down troops in Afghanistan, as the Obama administration had planned, to effectively zero, or whether conditions on the ground merit a substantial long-term presence of US troops in noncombat roles helping to support the Afghan army and police.\n\nAfter all, no one wants to see what happened in Iraq after the withdrawal of US forces in 2011 and the rise there three years later of ISIS. Already, ISIS has a foothold in Afghanistan.\n\nAlso unexplored was the issue of immigration.

    "text": "Doug Heye, a CNN political commentator, is a Republican 25-year veteran of politics in Washington and throughout the nation, including three campaigns in his native state of North Carolina. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) Perhaps no state will be closer than North Carolina. Every poll is neck and neck and hardly a day goes by without a candidate or surrogate visit.\n\nIn both the 2008 and 2012 elections, North Carolina was the second closest in the nation. President Barack Obama won the state in 2008 and lost it to Mitt Romney four years later.\n\nDespite this electoral tightness, Hillary Clinton enjoys two clear advantages that, in a normal political year, should push her over the finish line in the Tar Heel state -- organization and demographics.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe long 2008 primary battle forced both Clinton and Obama to campaign hard in North Carolina. Clinton sought to appeal to white conservative Democrats -- the \"Jesse-crats\" of yore -- more likely to support her in the primary than Obama, winning support of local conservative media, such as the traditionally conservative Dunn Daily Record.\n\nWhile Clinton came up short in the Democratic primary in 2008, instead of dismantling, Democratic organizations merged, morphed and evolved with Obama's campaign structures. Organizing for America and state-based liberal grass-roots organizations were associated with the Obama campaign.\n\nJUST WATCHED Attorney General pleased NC voter law struck down Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Attorney General pleased NC voter law struck down 00:59\n\nThis may help give Clinton a much needed enthusiasm boost, given tensions over House Bill 2 -- the \"bathroom bill\" -- and \"Moral Monday \" voting rights protests that have become a fixture at the state Capitol in Raleigh.\n\nClinton has more than 30 field offices in the state. Trump is just now working on opening up field offices in North Carolina. The Republican National Committee staff on the ground must overcome Trump's organizational absence. Many GOP candidates, chairs and activists focus on state and local campaigns, not Trump.\n\nDuring a recent visit to a North Carolina Republican county headquarters, I saw few Trump materials and no Trump enthusiasm. Signs for insurance commissioner and District Court judge were more prominently displayed than any Trump collateral, an attitude sure to affect voter outreach. At a recent Wake County Republican barbecue, candidate speeches avoided any mention of Trump. For the Trump campaign, party activists who are \"Reluctant Trump\" may be a bigger obstacle than anything Never Trump.\n\nPhotos: The do's and don'ts of courting Latino voters Photos: The do's and don'ts of courting Latino voters The do's and don'ts of courting the Latino vote \u2013 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump caused an uproar Tuesday when he had well-known Univision and Fusion anchor Jorge Ramos removed from the room and later called him a \"very emotional person\" after Ramos failed to yield when Trump wanted to take a question from a different reporter.

Hide Caption 8 of 8\n\nMeanwhile, absentee ballots are already being mailed out in the state, and, as The Associated Press is reporting , \"earliest numbers from advance voting for president show initial strength\" for Clinton, assuming that the Democrats who requested ballots have voted for her. This is in no small part due to her campaign's ability to find, target and contact potential absentee voters -- and get them to return those ballots. Trump lacks this ability, which should help Clinton run up the score on him before Election Day.\n\nDemographics\n\nNorth Carolina is a changing, growing state.\n\nFor generations, campaigns battled over the eastern part of the state, which, while growing in some areas, pales in comparison to suburban areas outside cities including Charlotte, Raleigh and Winston-Salem. These suburban areas -- such as Cary, which some call \"Containment Area of Relocated Yankees\" -- continue to grow in size and importance.\n\nIn these growing areas, many of these voters are new to the state and, even if Republican, uncomfortable with the direction the GOP Legislature has taken in the past few years.\n\nJUST WATCHED Polls show Clinton leading in three swing states Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Polls show Clinton leading in three swing states 00:45\n\nBut it's not merely the migration from Northern voters. Forsyth, Mecklenburg, Orange and Wake counties, which make up almost 25% of the state's population, have seen nearly 50% of new voter registration since Labor Day.\n\nSome of this may be due to the counties being home to colleges such as the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State University and Wake Forest University, where returning students are registering to vote. Those counties are also home to some of the state's 11 historically black colleges and universities, such as Johnson C. Smith University, Shaw University and Winston-Salem State University.\n\nYoung voters have not been a strong suit for Clinton, but African-Americans have. The Elon poll shows Clinton receiving 98% of North Carolina African-American voters -- and historically black colleges were virtual turnout machines for Obama. And recent racially charged comments by Trump supporters, including US Rep. Robert Pittenger of Charlotte (for which he later apologized), further hurts any Republican efforts to gain African-American votes.\n\nThe African-American percentage of the state's population has seen a small increase since 2008, but the Hispanic population has grown by nearly 20%, changing the makeup of some areas as it has grown. One is as likely to see Hispanic storefronts downtown (Tienda El Centro and La Jalisco, to name but two) in Siler City, a town so linked to \"Andy Griffith Show\" lore that Frances Bavier -- aka Aunt Bee -- relocated there post-retirement, than any reminder of Mayberry.\n\nBut if women are the cornerstone demographic for a Clinton win nationally, nowhere may that be more true than North Carolina. Fifty-six percent of all North Carolina voters in 2012 were women, the highest total of any state with exit polling. Romney received 49% of the women vote in 2012 despite his \"binders full of women\" comment and the Obama campaign's aggressive targeting of single women.\n\nWill those same voters find Trump's treatment of Clinton during Monday's debate as merely aggressive, or as overbearing? An early indicator , a Washington Post focus group in Cary, showed Trump did not fare well.\n\nTrump's misogynistic comments and Clinton's potential to serve as the first female president mean the mailboxes, airwaves and smartphones of women in North Carolina are already being flooded with pro-Clinton/anti-Trump messages. The debate should only increase their importance to the Clinton campaign.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAll of these factors should spell a somewhat comfortable victory for Clinton, something neither her husband nor Obama accomplished. And yet she is still struggling to keep her head above water in the state.\n\nSome of this is understandable -- Clinton is not personally popular and voters in the state find her as untrustworthy as voters throughout the nation. Undecided North Carolinians who favor the current direction of the country view Clinton overwhelmingly unfavorably. Military voters and veterans -- North Carolina ranks third in active duty military personnel and eighth in military veteran population -- view Hillary Clinton with the same suspicion as they viewed her husband.\n\nAnd if Trump is partially playing from Clinton's 2008 playbook to win North Carolina -- which involved appealing to white conservative voters and focusing more on conservative media -- his campaign must know there are less of those voters than eight years ago. It may be a coalition that can still win, but with a slim margin for error.\n\nGiven the closeness of the state the past two times and the closeness of the race as a whole (we are seriously talking about a 269-269 tie scenario), North Carolina may be what flips it. It's a must win for both candidates.\n\nNorth Carolina should be moving in Clinton's direction and Democrats have every reason to be optimistic about future races in the state. For now, however, Tobacco Road provides no guarantee of victory.",

(Photo source: WLOX)\n\nA water advisory remains in effect for the Industrial Seaway and Bernard Bayou in Gulfport after raw sewage seeped into those waterways.\n\nThe flow was contained. However, crews spent Tuesday afternoon trying to replace the damaged pipe. They had been hard at work, pumping and transporting the waste since they found out about the broken line more than 24-hours ago.\n\nAbout 500,000 gallons of raw sewage gushed from a 24-inch sewer line. Gulfport public works crews scrambled to dig a hole to reach the damaged pipe.\n\n\"The pipe is about seven feet below ground. Once we were able to look at it last night, we were able to determine that the pipe has a crack along the top of it,\" said Gulfport Public Works Director Wayne Miller.\n\nMiller said the repairs were completed around 1 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nThe problem started around 5:00 p.m. Monday. The city received reports of two broken force mains. The leak at Crossroads Parkway was fixed rather quickly. But the one on Glascock Drive in the Bernard Bayou Industrial District was much bigger.\n\nForce main ruptured on Glascock Drive in Gulfport, discharging 500,000 gallons of sewage. pic.twitter.com/XjtZN4ogbA \u2014 Trang Pham-Bui (@TrangPhamBui) October 4, 2016\n\n\"We've been running four pumper trucks continuously since around 9:00 last night, and they're taking the sewer flow from here and taking it straight over to the treatment plant,\" said Miller.\n\nSome of the sewage flowed into nearby ditches and drains, which lead to Bernard Bayou and the Industrial Seaway.

They're doing a great job doing what they can to get this cleaned up.\"\n\nMiller said no homes or businesses were impacted by the spill. However, MDEQ is advising people to avoid water contact and avoid eating seafood from nearby waters, which include the Industrial Seaway and Bernard Bayou from Highway 49 to the mouth of Big Lake.

    "text": "(CNN) Hillary Clinton leads in the polls nationally and in key battleground states, but the flood of stories regarding her private email server and donations to the Clinton Foundation demonstrate the former secretary of state won't be able to completely outrun voter skepticism -- or Donald Trump.\n\nTrump went on offense Monday, using the bulk of a speech in Akron, Ohio, to attack Clinton.\n\n\"No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay for play scandals as secretary of state,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I've become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of Hillary Clinton's criminality. It's criminality. Everybody knows it,\" he said as the crowd erupted in a sea of \"Lock her up!\" chants.\n\n\"The amounts involved, the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor immediately, immediately, immediately,\" Trump said. \"After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewash of the Clinton email crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton's new crimes, which happen all the time.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel\" Monday night, Clinton brushed off any concerns about the release of additional emails after a federal judge Monday gave the State Department until next month to come up with a plan for making public thousands of emails that the FBI recovered as part of its probe into Clinton's use a private email server.\n\n\"Jimmy, my emails are so boring,\" she said. \"And I'm embarrassed about that. They're so boring. So we've already released, I don't know, 30,000 plus, so what's a few more?\"\n\nTrump also encouraged his supporters to \"watch\" on Election Day, raising the specter of voter fraud: \"When I say 'watch,' you know what I'm talking about.\" Recently, Trump had warned that the November election could be \"rigged.\"\n\nTrump supporter Sen. Jeff Sessions suggested that the Democratic presidential candidate used her high position to \"extort\" from international governments for her family's foundation.\n\n\"The fundamental thing is you can not be Secretary of State of the United States of America and use that position to extort or seek contributions to your private foundation,\" he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day\" Tuesday. \"That is a fundamental violation of law and that does appear to have happened.\"\n\nFor Trump, the controversies are a welcome opportunity to push the idea that Clinton is part of the Washington establishment and can't be trusted to shun special interests. A Washington Post/ABC News poll from earlier this month showed that 59% of voters believe that Clinton is not honest and trustworthy. (That same poll has that 62% believe Trump is not trustworthy.)\n\nTrump bluntly argued that Clinton's actions at the State Department amounted to corruption, even suggesting Clinton was at the center of a racketeering scheme.\n\n\"We are going to take government away from the special interests that give her tens of millions of dollars so that she can broadcast absolutely phony ads about me and we're going to give it back to the voters,\" Trump vowed. \"Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you and your family and your country, not the special interests, the donors and the lobbyists.\"\n\nIt's a good time for Trump to go on offense against Clinton. She is spending most of the week fundraising, with several high-dollar events in California. His campaign is also keen on reminding people that Clinton hasn't had a press conference in months -- and therefore hasn't had to answer repeated questions on each new development.\n\nTrump's attacks aside, stories emerging over the past few days from a federal courtroom, Capitol Hill and an event on Long Island show it doesn't take much to get the issue of Clinton's emails and the Clinton Foundation back into the news cycle.\n\nClinton got some bad news from a federal judge Monday, who gave the State Department until September 23 to determine a plan on how to release nearly 15,000 documents the FBI had obtained as part of its investigation into her private email server -- possibly creating a timeline where thousands of emails could be made public right before Election Day.\n\nTrump's focus on Clinton may help take the spotlight off of himself ever so slightly. Having restructured his campaign team last week, Trump was expected to deliver a speech later this week outlining his immigration policy. But that speech has been delayed, a campaign source said.\n\nSo the campaign turned its attention on Clinton, the Clinton Foundation and her emails. That was readily apparent Monday, as both Trump and vice presidential nominee Mike Pence brought up the issue.\n\n\"It's time for Hillary Clinton to come clean about the Clinton Foundation,\" Pence said at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation last week announced it would ban donations to from corporations and foreign countries if Hillary Clinton is elected. Pence rhetorically asked why there wasn't a conflict of interest when she was Secretary of State.\n\n\"Apparently she'll have a conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation if she becomes President but I guess she didn't have a conflict of interest taking foreign donations while she was secretary of state of the United States of America,\" Pence said\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, accused Trump of using the issue to hide from his own problems.\n\n\"The Foundation has already laid out the unprecedented steps the charity will take if Hillary Clinton becomes president. Donald Trump needs to come clean with voters about his complex network of for-profit businesses that are hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to big banks, including the state-owned Bank of China, and other business groups with ties to the Kremlin,\" Podesta said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has brought up the foundation or emails, but a previous attack didn't end up going well. A suggestion that Russian hackers search for Clinton's 33,000 missing emails led to questions about whether he would be committing treason by asking foreign agents to hack a US presidential candidate\n\nBill Clinton outlines foundation future\n\nAs questions mount about the activities and future of the foundation, former President Bill Clinton announced major changes that would be implemented should Hillary Clinton win the White House.\n\nBill Clinton will curtail his direct involvement in the charity and the group will transition some programs to like-minded charities, he said in a statement on the foundation's website Monday. Clinton last week also said he would stop giving paid speeches.\n\n\"Over the last several months, members of the Foundation's senior leadership, Chelsea, and I have evaluated how the Foundation should operate if Hillary is elected,\" the former president wrote . \"Throughout the process, our top priorities have been preserving our most important programs, supporting the people who work for the Foundation and its affiliated programs, and resolving legitimate conflict of interest questions.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Clinton Foundation pointed to the new post from the former president when asked about Trump's comments.\n\nBill Clinton also announced last week that the Clinton Global Initiatives meeting of high-dollar donors, celebrities and foreign leaders next month would be its last.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation has raised money in the years since Bill Clinton left the White House and has launched a host of charitable efforts targeting climate change, improving quality of life for women and girls in developing countries and fighting health crises.\n\nNew email releases, subpoenas from Congress\n\nThe charitable foundation has been scrutinized throughout Hillary Clinton's presidential bid, but the organization has faced greater scrutiny since emails were newly uncovered showing a top Clinton Foundation donor seeking access to a top diplomat when Clinton was secretary of state\n\nNew emails obtained by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch and released Monday show then-Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band asking top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin to arrange a meeting with the then-secretary of state for the Crown Prince of Bahrain, Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa. The crown prince made a commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative that he would fund his own charity in the amount of $32 million for the crown prince's scholarship program. The funds and program were not controlled by the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton said Monday that the new exchange, and others, showed donors buying access to the secretary of state through the foundation. But none of the exchanges appeared to show a direct quid pro quo.\n\nJUST WATCHED Clinton's Robby Mook on Foundation: No quid pro quo Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton's Robby Mook on Foundation: No quid pro quo 01:35\n\n\"No matter how this group tries to mischaracterize these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as Secretary of State because of donations to the Clinton Foundation,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said about the newest emails.\n\nMeanwhile, on Capitol Hill Monday, congressional Republicans subpoenaed three technology companies involved in her unusual home server setup. The subpoenas were issued after the companies did not cooperate with a House committee's investigation into the issue, said House Science panel Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas.\n\nAnd on Long Island, Former Secretary of State Colin Powell pushed back on suggestions that he may have given Clinton the idea to use a private email account, telling media outlets that \"her people are trying to pin it on me.\"\n\n\"The truth is, she was using (the private email server) for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did,\" Powell said Saturday in East Hampton, New York, People magazine and the New York Post reported.\n\nCorrection: Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa made a commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative that he would fund his own charity in the amount of $32 million for the crown prince's scholarship program. The funds and program were not controlled by the Clinton Global Initiative. A previous version contained incorrect information.",

That number is set to double by 2050.\n\nIt's no surprise that the biggest polluters are also the most at risk: China, which boasts one of the world's fastest growing economies, also has the world's \"deadliest\" air, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nFor those who live here, the news shouldn't come as much of a shock. Pollution has become so ingrained in daily Chinese life that pollution masks featuring bold colors and flashy patterns have become must-have accessories for young urbanites concerned about breathing and looking good.\n\nTwo years ago, Beijing-based designer Masha Ma paired her garbs with Swarovski crystal-studded masks on the catwalks of Paris, then went on to sell them online alongside Chloe bags and Chanel pumps. At international schools around Beijing, students play inside million-dollar domes that act as air filters.\n\nIt's into this environment that award-winning Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde unveiled his Smog Free Tower, a seven-meter (23 feet) tall structure that combines beautiful design and technological advancement, during Beijing Design Week.\n\nPhotos: Beijing Design Week 2016 Beijing Design Week celebrates China's growing product design and craft industry.

Hide Caption 22 of 22\n\nA smog vacuum\n\nLooking like a cross between a spaceship and a traditional Chinese pagoda, the Smog Free Tower is essentially a giant air purifier created through a collaboration between Roosegaarde, Delft Technology University and European Nano Solutions, a green tech company in the Netherlands.\n\n\"It's the largest smog vacuum cleaner in the world,\" Roosegaarde says.\n\nHere's how it works: Using ion technology, the tower attracts and sucks in small pollution particles by sending positive ions into the air. Once inside the tower, these particles attach themselves to a grounded, negatively charged surface -- what's called a counter electrode.\n\nVents in the lower part of the tower then expel the clean air, creating a smog-free bubble around the structure.\n\n\"The tower cleans 30,000 cubic meters of air an hour,\" Roosegarde says, or roughly a football stadium per day.\n\nThe process improves surrounding air quality by 75 percent and, Roosegarde claims, and doesn't produce ozone, as the particles are charged with positive voltage rather than negative (\"the safest way to handle high volumes of dirty air,\" he says). The tower runs on no more than 1,400 watts, or the equivalent of what it takes to power a water boiler.\n\nRoosegaarde and his team have also figured out how to compress the captured particles into tiny \"gemstones\" that are then sealed in a resin cube and mounted onto rings and cufflinks. (Each stone is the result of about 1,000 cubic meters of filtered air.)\n\nPartly funded through Kickstarter, the Smog Free Tower took just over two and a half years to develop. Its pilot was unveiled last year in Rotterdam, where Roosegaarde's design studio is based, but it is to China that it owes much of its existence: Roosegaarde conceived the idea in Beijing in 2013.\n\n\"I distinctively remember looking out of my hotel window one day and simply not being able to see anything,\" he says. \"From one day to the next, the city had disappeared under a thick blanket of smog.\"\n\nRoosegaarde currently has the backing of China's Ministry of Environmental Protection, which has asked him to take his project across the country, with four more stops planned after Beijing. The support comes amid the government's reinforced efforts to tackle pollution, an integral part of China's 13th Five-Year Plan released last March.\n\nThroughout his tour, Roosegaarde will meet with universities, schools and environmental organizations.\n\n\"The goal is not only to offer a local, tangible solution to create clean parks,\" he says, \"but also setting a new sense of beauty -- a clean future -- through the sensory experience of clean air.\"\n\nJust the beginning\n\nMost of Roosegaarde's projects are public-oriented and socially conscious. His Smart Highway project, for instance, envisions roads that charge during the day and glow at night, while Waterlicht uses LED technology to show rising water levels.\n\nSuch ambitious endeavors aren't going unnoticed: Studio Roosegaarde just won the Design Innovation Medal at the London Design Festival.\n\nBut while Roosegaarde has high hopes for his Smog Free Tower, he knows it's not a permanent solution.\n\n\"Since we installed it in Beijing, the tower has collected daily as much smog as it did over two weeks in the Netherlands,\" Roosegaarde says. \"This is an issue that can't be fixed overnight, nor with just one tower. We need a bottom-up effort, with both citizens and governments actively working for change.\n\n\"My hope is that one day in 10 or 15 years, we'll look back at it and find it obsolete. The pressing question is how are we going to get there? This,\" he says, pointing at the tower, \"is a start.\"",

    "text": "Brigid Schulte is author of \" Overwhelmed: Work, Love and Play when No One has the Time ,\" a fellow at New America and a staff writer at the Washington Post. This is the second in a series, \"Big Ideas for a New America,\" in which the Washington-based think tank New America spotlights experts' solutions to the nation's greatest challenges. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) What if I hadn't worked so hard? What if . . . I had actually used . . . my position to be a role model for balance? Had I done so intentionally, who's to say that, besides having more time with my family, I wouldn't also have been even more focused at work? More creative? More productive? It took inoperable late stage brain cancer to get me to examine things from this angle. --Eugene O'Kelly, former CEO, KPMG\n\nWhile working on \"The Last Supper,\" Leonardo da Vinci regularly took off from painting for several hours at a time and seemed to be daydreaming aimlessly. Urged by his patron, the prior of Santa Maria delle Grazie, to work more continuously, da Vinci is reported to have replied, immodestly but accurately, \"The greatest geniuses sometimes accomplish more when they work less.\" --Tony Schwartz, \"Be Excellent at Anything\"\n\nIn his 1932 classic essay, \"In Praise of Idleness,\" Bertrand Russell heralded a coming time when modern technology would bring shorter work hours and time for leisure to be enjoyed equally by everyone.\n\nWork and leisure both would be \"delightful,\" and the world would be the better for it. \"Every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every painter will be able to paint without starving . . . Above all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves, weariness and dyspepsia.\"\n\nRussell, along with scholars like Josef Pieper, author of \"Leisure, the Basis of Culture,\" thought that it is in moments of leisure that civilization gets created. Both were extraordinarily productive, despite their call for what may today be seen as slacking.\n\nBut they argued that it is only when we take the time to lift our noses from the grindstone and are not busy with the getting, making and doing that ensures our survival, that flights of imagination, bursts of insight can lead to inventions like the wheel, art, philosophy, literature, scientific discoveries and innovation.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, leisure time was the ultimate status symbol, a way not only of conspicuously showing off your wealth, but of your ability to enjoy the best that life had to offer. Even those without wealth in the labor movement sought a living wage and shorter work hours so they could, as a famous protest song of the time put it, not only have their bread, but the time to enjoy the roses, the fruits of their labor.\n\nIronically, it was only when Henry Ford took the wildly controversial step of shuttering his automobile manufacturing factories on Saturday and cutting daily work hours from the then-standard 12 to 8 that workers began not only enjoying leisure time at home, but became more efficient and productive at work.\n\nThough his fellow captains of industry screamed in protest, Ford had based the decision on his own in-house research of how far he could push manual laborers before they became so exhausted or resentful that they'd begin making costly mistakes. Within a few years, the Ford way became the industry standard, and thus was born the 40-hour work week.\n\nEconomists, too, began making rosy predictions of a coming age of abundant leisure. Keynes thought that by 2030, we'd be working a 15-hour work week, and all would have time to enjoy \"the hour and the day virtuously and well.\" Others predicted a 22-hour work week, six-month work year or a standard retirement age of 38. If anything, thinkers at the time worried about what the masses would do to occupy themselves with so much free time on their hands. The predictions seem ludicrous now.\n\nIn the United States, white-collar workers work longer and more extreme hours than their peers in just about any other advanced economy, save South Korea, where the Wall Street Journal has reported overworked Koreans are checking themselves into prison-like meditation retreats just to get away from it all, and Japan, where they've even coined a word for death from overwork: karoshi. (No one leaves until the boss leaves. And the boss never leaves.)\n\nWorkers in the United States give up among the most vacation days. We are the only advanced economy with no national vacation policy ( see how we stack up in the chart below). And technology has enabled not just flexible work, but for work to seep into every corner, every hour and every minute of the day.\n\nThe 40-hour work week of Ford's legacy can seem like a cruel dream -- the labor policy that later enshrined it, the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, now perversely gives businesses incentive to work salaried workers to the point of burnout, and to keep hourly workers' hours artificially low to avoid paying benefits or overtime.\n\nSalaried workers have too little leisure time that they can choose and control, what leisure scholars say is the essence of pure leisure. And hourly workers, too much. Though without either choice or control, those blank, unfilled hours of insecurity and gnawing anxiety can hardly be called leisure.\n\nJust as with income inequality, our experience of work and leisure is increasingly diverging. As millions of Americans remained sidelined from the economy, working far less than they'd like, and for a minimum wage that in no major city in the country could cover the cost of a two-bedroom apartment, others wear long work hours like a badge of honor.\n\nEconomists have found that our workplaces reward employees by how long they sit at their desks in the office, not for what they do. Leisure is seen as unproductive at best, and frivolous or a waste of time at worst.\n\nAnd that's not just stupid, it's dangerous.\n\nWe need to build an economy that creates enough work at fair wages for everyone. And we need to recapture our lost leisure. Those two aspirations can work together.\n\nIn a knowledge economy, our strength comes from the power of our ideas. And we are wired for those ideas and inspiration to hit in quiet moments of -- leisure.\n\nPsychologists John Kounios and Mark Beeman have mapped brain waves and found the \"a-ha\" moment comes in a calm, relaxed state, when we are doing anything BUT work -- like when physicist Richard Feynman idly watched students goofing off spinning plates in the cafeteria and began making calculations of the wobbles, \"for the fun of it,\" which led to his developing the \"Feynman diagrams\" to explain quantum electrodynamics and ultimately resulted in his Nobel Prize.\n\nNeuroscience is finding that when we are idle, in leisure, our brains are most active, the Default Mode Network lights up, which, like airport hubs, connect parts of our brain that don't typically communicate. So a stray thought, a random memory, an image can combine in novel ways to produce novel ideas.\n\nAnders Ericsson studied elite musicians at the Berlin Academy of Music and is credited with the now wildly popular notion that it takes 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to master anything. But the key that separated the truly great from the good and the adequate was the way they spent those 10,000 hours: they practiced intensely, first thing in the morning when they were freshest, for no more than 60 to 90 minutes at a time, and they rested more. In other words, like brain waves, like heart beats, they worked in short bursts and recovered in leisure and became excellent at what they did.\n\nBut perhaps the most compelling case for leisure is this: despite our overwork culture, we have a lot of butt-in-chair presenteeism, sick, unhappy, burned out and disengaged workers. We work long hours, but we do not necessarily work productive, efficient or creative hours.\n\nSome years, international comparisons of GDP per hours worked have found, workers in Norway, Ireland, Denmark and even France, with their 30 days of paid vacation every year , their caf\u00e9 culture, their generous paid family leave policies, their short work hours mandated by law and their new directive forbidding some employers from expecting workers to check work-related texts and emails after hours, beat us by a mile.\n\nAs we think about the next American economy, we need to consider policies, as well as cultural shifts, that respect that people need time, especially relaxed and personal time, every bit as much as they need money.\n\nBy dialing down on overwork, by once again matching wages, which have been stagnating, to productivity, which has been rising, we might not only be able to create more work for those who need it, and work smarter, but foster the creativity and innovation that will lead to a more dynamic, productive economy, and a better life.\n\nAfter all, isn't the pursuit of happiness part of what defines us as Americans?\n\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion",

    "text": "(CNN) A chemical formerly used in pesticides and most recently in carpet-cleaning products has been ingested by wildlife throughout North America, according to a study appearing today in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.\n\nThe blood of dolphins, fish and birds all tested positive for perfluorophosphinic acids, one class of a common industrial chemical group used for a variety of purposes, including stain-resistant carpet sprays and nonstick cooking surfaces since the 1950s.\n\nPerfluorophosphinic acids in particular were used in several pesticide formulations in North America and some countries in Europe since the 1970s, according to Zhanyun Wang , a scientist at the Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering in Zurich. Wang has done extensive research on these chemicals but was not involved in the current study.\n\n\"There is no new information to show if they are increasingly or decreasingly used,\" Wang said, adding that any information about current use of these chemicals is sketchy at best . \"More information from the manufacturers is needed.\"\n\nReports from the Environmental Protection Agency suggest that highest production of perfluorophosphinic acids in the United States -- somewhere within the range of 4.5 and 227 tons -- occurred between 1998 and 2002.\n\nBeginning in 2006, the EPA restricted the use of these chemicals in pesticides, and currently, there are no perfluoroalkyl substances approved for use as inert ingredients in pesticide formulations. In a published report , the agency noted that it had \"identified human health and environmental risks of concern.\"\n\nYet environmental scientists believe perfluorophosphinic acids continue to be used today in commercial products, including rug-cleaning formulas.\n\nRecently, Amila O. De Silva, a scientist who works for the Canadian government, conducted a small-scale experiment. She and her colleagues tested 102 residential dust samples in Vancouver between 2007 and 2008. They detected perfluorophosphinic acids in 83% of the household dust samples.\n\nDe Silva then decided to take a look at the wider environment.\n\n\"We wanted to do a survey of these relatively under-studied compounds in aquatic organisms,\" De Silva said of her new study, which was funded by the Canadian government. She and her colleagues analyzed blood samples from one type of fish, one type of bird and one type of mammal across North America: northern pike found near the Island of Montreal; cormorants from the Great Lakes; and bottlenose dolphins from both Sarasota Bay, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\"We aimed for diversity: air-breathing versus water-breathing, differences in habitat, different taxonomic groups,\" De Silva said.\n\nTesting the blood of these different species occupying separate environmental niches, De Silva discovered that concentrations of perfluorophosphinic acids were low.\n\nHowever, she and her team detected these chemicals in all of the samples from fish, birds and mammals -- 100%.\n\nPerfluorophosphinic acids are known to linger in the environment because sunlight, water and microbes are unable to break down these complex chemicals into smaller harmless chemical components.\n\nAll the mechanisms the environment has to clean itself up \"don't seem to apply\" to them, explained De Silva. This long life means both people and animals are more likely to inhale or ingest them.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Previous work by other scientists in three separate publications have shown perfluorophosphinic acids are found in human blood samples from North America and Germany,\" De Silva said. In Germany, for example, scientists found the chemical in human blood from as far back as 1983 and annually up until the most recent tested sample in 2009, she said.\n\nYet no published studies on the toxicity/effects in humans or any other organisms exist, as far as De Silva knows. \"The EPA is leading some laboratory studies on perfluorophosphinic acids in mice, and our colleagues at the University of Toronto are working with perfluorophosphinic acids in rats,\" De Silva said.\n\nSurprisingly, even though the United States restricts use of these compounds, Canada permits them, said De Silva. \"That has implications when we look at the Great Lakes, which are binational.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Presidential approval, the honoring of a golfing great, rowdy crowds, and a perfect picture of Rickie Fowler alone among his kissing teammates -- Team USA's Ryder Cup victory had it all.\n\nBarack Obama referenced Arnold Palmer, who passed away the week before the tournament , after Sunday's 17-11 victory ended the Americans' run of three successive defeats against Europe.\n\n\"Proud to see our guys bring the trophy back home,\" the US President wrote on Twitter. \"Arnie is smiling down.\"\n\nWhat a win by the USA in #RyderCup . Proud to see our guys bring the trophy back home. Arnie is smiling down.\n\nHis message was supported by nine-time major winner Gary Player, a contemporary of Palmer as they helped grow golf internationally in the 1960s and '70s.\n\n\"No doubt this result is good for the Ryder Cup, good for the game of golf & fitting given Arnold Palmer's passing,\" the South African tweeted.\n\nPalmer played in six Ryder Cups from 1961-73 -- all of which he won -- and was undefeated in two terms as US captain.\n\nThe 2016 tournament at Hazeltine served as a tribute to Palmer's legacy.\n\nChants of 'Arnold Palmer' ring out at the #RyderCup closing ceremony. #RIPArnie https://t.co/jxClw4igsM \u2014 PGA.COM (@PGAcom) October 2, 2016\n\nDuring the closing ceremony, his name was spontaneously chanted by fans, with players also heard joining in. Before the tournament began Friday, fans were encouraged to sign a tribute wall at Hazeltine in memory of the golfing legend.\n\nWinning captain Davis Love III said Palmer's death had united the US players before the tournament:\n\n\"This team had to come together,\" he told Sky Sports . \"We lost Arnold Palmer on Sunday, that was tragic for golf, that was a blow to our team to start the week.\"\n\nRowdy fans\n\nHowever, some of the feelgood factor was tarnished by complaints about the behavior of some fans at Hazeltine, who were heard heckling and verbally abusing players on the course.\n\nWhile one US supporter made headlines when he challenged a group of Europe players during their practice round Thursday -- and subsequently won a $100 bet -- some of the later interaction was not so friendly.\n\nThe hostility of home fans had been stoked when Peter Willett -- the brother of Team Europe's Danny Willett -- published an article ranting about US supporters\n\nArnold Palmer would have expected both teams and all fans to play and act within the spirit of the game... \u2014 Gary Player (@garyplayer) 1 October 2016\n\nThe 2016 Masters champion, who was comprehensively beaten 5 & 4 by American Brooks Koepka Sunday and lost his two earlier matches, has since defended his brother's comments, despite apologizing at first.\n\n\"Very strange week here at the Ryder Cup,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Unfortunately, some American fans showed that @P_J_Willett was in fact correct.\n\n\"Nothing to blame my bad play on. But still shows that sometimes fans don't know when to call it a day. Shame really!\"\n\nWhen asked about his first Ryder Cup experience, a laughing Willett -- with a can of beer at his side -- told the assembled reporters that it had been \"s**t.\" He then offered to elaborate on that remark, saying it had been \"really s**t.\"\n\nWillett's teammate Rory McIlroy also claimed to be on the receiving end of abuse from the partisan Minnesotan crowd -- he asked for a fan who insulted him Saturday to be ejected from the Minnesota course.\n\nAfter sinking a 60-foot putt in his Sunday singles clash with Patrick Reed, the Northern Irishman responded in animated fashion by asking the American supporters why they had gone quiet.\n\n\"There have been some boundaries crossed,\" the world No. 3 told reporters. \"I let it get to me a couple of times which I probably shouldn't have.\n\n\"You have to keep your concentration out there and it's been a long day and sometimes emotions run high. It fueled me a lot. The more they shouted, the better we played.\"\n\nAmerican joy\n\nMembers of Team USA were understandably delighted with their first Ryder Cup victory since 2008, having suffered a heartbreaking final-day defeat in its last contest on home soil that became known as the \"Miracle at Medinah.\"\n\nJust @JBHolmesgolf and I driving home with the Ryder Cup. #NBD \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/e5JpC7mSah \u2014 Ryan Moore (@ryanmoorepga) 3 October 2016\n\nBrandt Snedeker tweeted his thanks to US team vice-captain Bubba Watson for his guidance after winning all three of his matches, and unveiled a special \"We Beat Europe\" shirt.\n\nMy shirt for tonight!! #12strong #USA pic.twitter.com/DVtCiEwAQn \u2014 Brandt Snedeker (@BrandtSnedeker) October 3, 2016\n\nRickie Fowler, who beat Olympic champion Justin Rose in his singles match, found himself surrounded by his loved-up teammates and their wives and girlfriends.

    "text": "Just before the Senate convenes at 11am ET today to work on a plan to avoid the fiscal cliff, Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) tells Starting Point that he believes that a bipartisan agreement on revenue has been reached, but it\u2019s now a question of whether the money will go to more spending or deficit reduction.\n\nSen. Isakson says, \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not sure we have the inside information, but I do believe the revenue issue is no longer a question. The question is making sure any new revenues go to debt spending reduction and deficit relief rather than new spending. It's deficits that got us into this problem. It's only reducing deficits that get us out of this problem.\u201d\n\nWhen CNN\u2019s Ali Velshi asks him to clarify if a revenue deal has been accepted, Sen. Isakson responds, \u201cNo, that's not my best information, but it's my best belief that they've reached an agreement on revenues. What that level is, I don't know, but the question now is where those revenues go. If they go to new spending, we're going to have a problem making a deal because spending has been our problem. But if they go towards deficit reduction, which ultimately will be debt relief, that will be a good thing, and we probably will have a deal.\u201d\n\nStarting Point with Soledad O\u2019Brien airs weekday mornings from 7-9am ET on CNN.",

    "text": "Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. This commentary has been updated since its publication. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) I just finished reading one of the most powerful things I've ever seen.\n\nIf you've already seen it, you likely feel the same way:\n\nIt is riveting. It's raw. I hung on every single word.\n\nIt is the 12-page victim impact statement written by a woman who was raped in January 2015 on the Stanford University campus after a night of drinking at a party.\n\nThe power of her words stood in stark contrast to those of the father of her attacker. He, too, wrote a letter to the judge who held his son's fate in his hands. It is deeply disturbing in its plainspoken and clueless banality, and tells you everything you need to know about why the crime of rape so frequently goes unpunished in America.\n\nThis is a case with no ambiguity. There were witnesses to her attack: two male Stanford students were riding their bikes across campus when they spotted Brock Allen Turner on top of a woman who wasn't moving. These men are among the heroes in her heartbreakingly sad story.\n\nThey chased him, tackled him and held him until the police came. The victim had no memory of the rape. She was unconscious behind a dumpster when Turner assaulted her. His defense: she consented.\n\nHe was convicted of all three felony accounts and will register as a sex offender. He faced 14 years in prison, and will only serve six months. (update: Turner was released from jail Friday after serving 3 months of his sentence.)\n\nAt the sentencing, the victim read her letter aloud and addressed Turner directly. In it, she gives a harrowing description of her rape and a jaw-dropping account of its aftermath. Reading it will expose you to the horror every rape victim faces as she is retraumatized over and over while society seeks \"justice\" against her rapist.\n\nI'm a parent. I was so moved that I printed out a copy. I wanted my family to read it. Not just our two daughters, but my husband and our son.\n\nThat's who should be reading this letter. Give it to your sons, your brothers and your mates.\n\nIf anything is going to change the culture of rape in our society, it will be a turnaround led by men like the two guys who stopped it that night and the Santa Clara county district attorney, Jeff Rosen, who called the sentence \"unjust.\"\n\nRosen added that \"the fact that the defendant preyed upon an intoxicated stranger on a college campus should not be viewed as less serious than if he assaulted an intoxicated stranger in downtown Palo Alto... Campus rape is no different than off-campus rape. Rape is rape.\"\n\nWe women know all too well about victim blaming, alcohol as an excuse for assault. It's not alcohol that's raping women; it is men.\n\nOur sons, all the young men in our lives need to be told: Alcohol is never an excuse\n\nAs the victim wrote: \"Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked.\"\n\nIt's black and white: If a woman is drunk, she can't consent.\n\nAfter hearing from the victim, the judge also considered the appalling letter from the rapist's father, Dan Turner.\n\nIn it, he pleads with the judge for leniency for his son, explaining that his son should not have to go to prison for \"20 minutes of action.\" The father describes how \"this\" has affected his son negatively\u2014he has lost his appetite and doesn't like eating \"ribeye steak\" anymore.\n\nJUST WATCHED Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? 03:45\n\nHe writes, \"The fact that he now has to register as a sexual offender for the rest of his life forever alters where he can live, visit, work, and interact with people and organization.\" He argues that his son's \"life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve.\"\n\nIn the end, the judge sentenced Turner to six months in county prison, saying a harsher penalty would have a \"severe impact\" on the aspiring athlete. His sentence includes probation and his name in a sex offender registry.\n\nThat last part isn't to punish Turner -- it's to protect us all from him. You know why he has to register as a sexual offender? It's because he committed a sexual crime.\n\nEven after the trial. Even after the conviction, there is still denial -- Turner's dad writing that his son has \"never been violent to anyone including the night of\" the crime! Twelve jurors believed otherwise. And now the Turners will appeal.\n\nSocial media has been rightfully ablaze. The most compelling tweet I have seen is this one by Twitter user Jez Kemp, who edited the dad's letter to highlight the victim-blaming, swapping in female pronouns to illuminate the issue. Take a look:\n\nRape isn't a story about alcohol. It's one of choices. And every man has a choice. To rape or not. To rescue or ignore. To deliver justice or give someone a slap on the wrist.\n\nThe only thing that will change this is awareness by men. The good guys. That's why I'm asking you to share this letter with your sons, your brothers and your friends.",

    "text": "(CNN) With evocative names such as \"Skewed Tobacco Pouch Street\" and \"East River Rice Lane,\" the charming, ancient Hutongs of Beijing are always popular with visitors to the sprawling capital city.\n\nNarrow alleyways run alongside walled courtyards, transporting those who wander down them back to the Yuan Dynasty of the 13th century, when many were created, and conjuring up images of a communal lifestyle in stark contrast to the frenetic pace of the modern Chinese megapolis.\n\nBut time has not been kind to these old neighborhoods.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, over 3,000 Hutongs could be found in Beijing. But thanks to a program of rapid modernization, the vast majority of these have been torn down.\n\nToday, according to same estimates, just 500 remain\n\nModern upgrades\n\nAlthough the government has taken steps to protect the surviving Hutongs, they are threatened by degradation.\n\nMany of the homes in these areas have fallen into disrepair, with poor insulation and sewage facilities.\n\nBut Beijing architecture firm the People's Architecture Office (PAO) has devised a solution for delivering upgrades while retaining the traditional character of the Hutong homes.\n\nThe PAO is installing prefabricated modules in and around the houses, composed of panels made of steel and glass. The modules include insulation, wiring, doors, windows, and sparkling finishes, and the panels fit together to create accordion-style units that can be adjusted into numerous configurations to maximize space, including a fold-out shower.\n\nThe plug-in modules cost $500 per square meter -- one-tenth of the Beijing average of $5,000 per square meter -- and can be installed in a day.\n\nJames Shen, cofounder of PAO, says the units offer convenience, and can be installed without damaging the ancient architecture.\n\n\"They are small,\" he says. \"It means that we are able to bring them piece by piece into these very narrow alleys and into these courtyard houses. It also means that we can renovate without tearing any of the old structures down.\"\n\nExpansion plans\n\nThe modules were initially tested in a government-sponsored trial on a dozen homes, which earned the PAO several awards, including one at the 2015 World Architecture Festiva l.\n\nThe group recently performed its first installation commissioned by a resident, in the Guangcai Hutong, close to the famed Imperial Palace in Beijing's \"Forbidden City.\"\n\nResident Fan Ke tells CNN the module has been transformative, particularly for the additional light it provides.\n\n\"When I lived here a child, it was always dark,\" says Ke. \"Now after the renovation, I'm bathed in sunlight throughout the day. I no longer feel caged in.\"\n\nConstruction of the plugin unit.\n\nShen hopes the first private commission will be followed by thousands more.\n\nThe architect says such a program would breathe new life into the hutongs, which are already seeing increased demand in central areas. One couple recently spent over $800,000 on an 11 square meter home in Wenchang Hutong\n\n\"This kind of solution can help rejuvenate a lot of these older areas,\" says Shen. \"It can show younger people that you don't have to move to a brand new modern apartment complex.\"\n\nPower to the people\n\nSome analysts believe, however, that the prefab units do not go far enough to address the decline of hutong houses.\n\nPhotos: Beijing Design Week 2016 Photos: Beijing Design Week 2016 Beijing Design Week celebrates China's growing product design and craft industry.

Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) Of all the stories you heard in the news in the past few days, which one moved you the most? Which outraged you, brought you to tears, led you to action? Which did you talk about with your friends, post on Facebook, discuss on Twitter? If the answer is the killing of Cecil the lion, you are in lots of company.\n\nFrida Ghitis\n\nBy now, it seems, most people agree that the killing, apparently for fun, of the majestic lion by a Minnesota dentist visiting Zimbabwe was a perplexing act of pointless cruelty and cowardice. It spawned millions of posts on Facebook and Twitter -- a kind of outrage tsunami.\n\nCecil, who was apparently well-known and loved in the natural park where he lived in Zimbabwe, died in a most unnatural way, lured from his home and slaughtered. (The dentist, now perhaps fearing for his life, has apparently gone into hiding.)\n\nThe intensity of the backlash over the trophy killing has triggered a counter-backlash. Why, some are now asking, do people care so much about the death of a lion when so many human beings are suffering and dying? The surge of sorrow for a dead lion, they say, when compared to the relative quiet about other wrongs, reveals a moral flaw in our humanity, a defect in our moral compass.\n\nPhotos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours\n\n\n\nFor decades, the majestic wildlife found across Africa has been a major draw for tourists wanting to catch a glimpse of roaring lions, towering elephants and rare rhinos.\n\n\n\nBut wildlife tourism should always be a case of look, but don't touch.\n\n\n\nFor several African countries, wildlife is more than a tourism treasure.

It's also a key source of revenue. A recent study by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNTWO) compiled figures from government and tour operators throughout the continent to assess the state of the wildlife tourism industry. It found that the industry contributes 80% of international travel sales to the continent, a large percentage of the $34.2 billion African tourism industry.

Permits to visit a gorilla family cost between $500-700, meaning the forest, home to roughly half the world's wild mountain gorillas, generates approximately $15 million annually. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours The Serengeti-Ngorongoro southern circuit, a key migration route, is another tourist hotspot.

Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours UNTWO worked out that across the continent, the average wildlife tour lasts 10 days, has six participants and costs $433 per day.

Most notable, of course, is the crisis he experienced in the early 1990s when he was unable to pay personal and corporate debts in the neighborhood of $3.4 billion\n\nTrump is also a nimble entrepreneur, who looks for opportunities and seizes them decisively. Witness his ability to deal in real estate, entertainment and retail merchandising, all at the same time.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, open questions remain about his consistent record of cruelty and excess when dealing with critics and competitors. Trump's code begins with the belief that he's justified in \"hitting back ten times harder\" whenever he's offended. If our presidents believed in this approach, America would have engaged in shooting wars with untold numbers of countries that have, in recent decades, committed transgressions against the United States.\n\nWould Trump have hit back 10 times harder when North Korea detained the spy ship Pueblo?

MUST WATCH Keeping Them Honest: Trump on Afghanistan & gun control 03:48\n\nWe can ask additional questions about Trump's penchant for bullying. In some cases this trait has shown itself in mere words, as he has attempted to humiliate, disparage and marginalize others. In other instances he has sought to force innocent landowners off their properties to make way for his developments. This willingness to use any means necessary to get what he wants raises serious concern about Trump's ability to manage America's affairs in a complex world.\n\nWhat does Trump believe?\n\nMore than any political figure in modern times, Trump represents an ideological puzzle. Although he now claims the conservative Republican mantle, he has often associated himself with liberal and Democratic Party ideas. In 1999 he told CNN, \"I've actually been an activist Democrat and Republican.\"\n\nIn the past, Trump said he is \"totally pro-choice.\" Now he is against abortion rights, recently musing about punishing women who might violate a ban on the procedure.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary 02:02\n\nIn the past, Trump was in favor of levying a big tax on the rich , himself included, to pay down the federal deficit. Like banks, rich people have the money, and Trump reasoned that they could afford to help the country out. Today, Trump is in favor of big tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nIn 2000 Trump proposed banning private ownership of assault weapons and increasing the waiting period for the purchase of guns. In the current campaign he has declared himself to be an ardent defender of gun rights, and he has even proposed eliminating gun-free zones near schools.\n\nThe list of Trump flip-flops is long and includes his positions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his regard for Hillary Clinton's performance as secretary of state. Voters, especially those conservatives who want a clear sense of what their standard-bearer will do as president, deserve explanations for these shifts.\n\nHow rich is he?\n\nThroughout his life Trump has cited his wealth as evidence of his excellence but without offering verifiable proof of his claims. In the 1970s he cruised Manhattan in a chauffeured limousine and gave others the impression that he was in control of the $200 million fortune amassed by his father.\n\nIn the 1980s, when he first made it onto the Forbes magazine list of America's wealthiest men and women, Trump complained often and loudly about how his holdings were underestimated. More recently he said he is worth some $10 billion.\n\nThe record produced by those who have looked closely at Trump's finances raises many questions. Writer Wayne Barrett reported in the 1980s that Trump's income as of 1978 was less than $100,000. In the 1993 biography of Trump called \"Lost Tycoon,\" Harry Hurt III noted that during his divorce from his first wife, Ivana, her attorneys found that Trump had never been worth the billions of dollars he claimed. Hurt also reported that in March 1992, Trump's own lawyers said he could not afford to pay Ivana even half of the $20 million he had offered as a settlement.\n\nMore recently doubts about his wealth arose in 2005 when journalist Tim O'Brien wrote that Trump was probably worth between $150 million and $250 million. For a man who reveled in his image as a billionaire, O'Brien's estimate was too much to bear. Trump sued. The case was dismissed by the trial judge. Trump appealed. He lost\n\nWere Trump a more circumspect and well-mannered man, who never bragged about how rich he is, his wealth would be less of an issue. However Trump has made his fortune such an important part of his identity that voters deserve to know the truth. Many of the facts are contained in Trump's personal income tax filings, and it is now a campaign tradition for candidates to make these documents public. Clinton has made public all of her returns going back to 2000.\n\nSo far, Trump has refused to release his returns because, he says, he is undergoing an audit on returns filed in the last few years. Nothing in the law, or in federal regulations, would prohibit him from making the documents public now, but if he is uncomfortable with releasing those forms, he could simply match Clinton for those years that are settled.\n\nSuch a release would reassure the public that Trump is who he says he is -- a really rich man -- and allow a glimpse into other matters, including his charitable giving. It is a matter of conservative orthodoxy that the rich should be spared excessive taxation so they can support society freely with their philanthropy.\n\nIs he a man of character?\n\nPersonality, which can be seen in a smile, heard in a glib remark or felt when viewing a performance, is not the most important measure of a man or woman. Many people with winning personalities are, in fact, hucksters, con men, manipulators and deceivers. In fact, the false signals flashed by well-practiced performers, including politicians, compel us to look for the signs of the character beneath the personality.\n\nExperts in assessing character generally look for some traits such as autonomy and life purpose that Trump clearly possesses in abundance. But there are other areas of character , including positive relations with others, ethical behavior, empathy, honesty and humility where Trump would not achieve a very high score.\n\nIn his long and very public life, Trump has often shown he is willing to do things others consider wrong in order to get what he wants. This includes using a false identity to make claims about his success, carrying out a bitter divorce dispute in the tabloid press, criticizing the appearance of others and refusing to take the high road when offered the chance.\n\nThe most troubling aspect of Trump's character can be seen in his devotion to the so-called birther campaign that sought to delegitimize President Barack Obama. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, birthers led by Trump insisted that some mystery surrounded Obama's status as a citizen born in the United States.\n\nLong after documents were produced to settle this falsely posed question, Trump continued to raise doubts and thus signal his allegiance to those who considered the President to be an unworthy \"other.\" The racism latent in the birther movement was documented in a study by University of Delaware psychologist Eric Heyman, but the link to prejudice was always plain to see. Rather than stand against birtherism, Trump built a following by exploiting it.\n\nIn fact, one can find precedent for Trump's birtherism in his previous provocative statements about racially sensitive subjects. Other evidence of his character can be found in his selective use of facts, his tendency to inflame conflict rather than cool it and his devotion to self-promotion.\n\nIn the past Trump's character has been well-suited to his pursuit of success as he defines it. But as revealed thus far, it would disqualify him when it comes to the presidency. We can only hope Trump has something better to show and will do it when placed under the pressure of the coming campaign.",

    "text": "San Diego (CNN) Twenty-five years ago, Paula Claussen's friend invited her to make the short trip from her home in San Diego, California, across the border to Tijuana, Mexico, to donate clothing to people in need.\n\nClaussen didn't expect that day to change the course of her life.\n\nThe drive took less than an hour, but when they arrived at their destination -- a shantytown on the outskirts of Tijuana -- Claussen couldn't believe her eyes.\n\n\"I was shocked by the conditions that I saw down there,\" she said.\n\nI was shocked by the conditions that I saw.\n\nFamilies with young children were living in ramshackle homes: The dirt floors turned to mud when it rained. The walls had gaps, allowing tarantulas, rattlesnakes and rats to invade. Many roofs were merely old tarps with holes in them.\n\nThere was no running water, no electricity and no sewage system.\n\n\"It was something that touched me very deeply,\" Claussen said.\n\nSo in 1991, she started Project Mercy. The nonprofit has constructed more than 1,250 free homes for people living in Tijuana's most desperate communities.\n\n\"It still horrifies me every time I see the way people are living and the obstacles they face on a daily basis. It's nothing I can get over,\" Claussen said. \"All I can do is try to help them.\"\n\nCNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Claussen about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\n\nCNN Hero Paula Claussen and volunteers construct a home in one workday\n\nCNN: You really just stumbled upon this problem. How did you go from seeing the issue to dedicating your life to helping?\n\nClaussen: I was horrified to see the conditions people in these villages on the outskirts of Tijuana were living in. I saw the desperation in their eyes and yet they were so pleasant to us, and that really touched my heart. All of a sudden, a passion grew inside me to make a difference for these people in particular.\n\nSo I started going down there a lot to donate clothing and other items. One day I was helping a woman move things into her shack and was completely shocked to see the young woman's sick son sleeping on the dirt floor. I realized then that there was something these families needed more than anything else: stable homes.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Paula Claussen: Changing lives in one day Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Paula Claussen: Changing lives in one day 02:15\n\nCNN: You and your team are able to build a home from start to finish in one day. What are the homes like?\n\nClaussen: The homes are approximately 16 by 20 feet in size. They are constructed out of wooden frames and have a concrete slab floor. Each house has four windows and a solid door. The back part of the homes are divided into two rooms. Each home has a flight of stairs leading up to a loft area, where children tend to sleep.\n\nThey are constructed to be as secure as possible. We also build in a breaker box for people to access electricity safely inside their homes, if that's an option for them. We paint the homes bright colors. Families are also given carpets, mattresses and other necessities. Volunteers arrive at 8 a.m., and usually by 4 p.m. they are complete.\n\nCNN: Your group engages people from both sides of the border to build the homes.\n\nClaussen: What we're doing is bringing neighbors together that are living totally separate lives and giving them the opportunity to get to know each other better.\n\nVolunteers from California come down to help build the houses. They work alongside the local community. They all come together, work together, and by the end of the day, they're all friends shaking hands, having bear hugs. It's a great feeling. They come away with a totally different perspective and with a totally different attitude towards the plight of these people who are their neighbors next door.\n\nIt creates a bond that people would not otherwise form. Many volunteers want to come back and visit the families they meet. That makes the work very special.\n\nClaussen stands outside a Project Mercy home with the Cervantes family\n\nCNN: What's it like to give a family the keys to their new home?\n\nClaussen: They are in tears. The fear has gone out of their eyes and they are just in awe.\n\nTo see the joy and relief on their faces when they walk into their new home, it makes me very proud. It's a great feeling to witness how we are changing their lives in just one day.\n\nI think an adequate shelter is a basic human need. Anyone that has a solid shelter over their head has a better chance of achieving a better life.\n\nWant to get involved?

    "text": "Today on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, spoke to CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger in an exclusive interview about the events shaping current domestic and global politics including the Israeli election, the Iran nuclear talks, the terror threats throughout the Middle East, and the nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General.\n\nTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\n\nMcCain on President Obama\u2019s reaction to the Israeli election: \u201cthere was a free and fair democratic election, the only nation in the region that will have such a thing. The president should get over it. Get over your temper tantrum, Mr. President. It's time that we work together with our Israeli friends and try to stem this tide of ISIS and Iranian movement throughout the region, which is threatening the very fabric of the region. The least of your problems is what Bibi Netanyahu said during an election campaign. If every politician were held to everything they say in a political campaign, obviously, that would be a topic of long discussion. But the point is, is the J.V., as the president described them, is just moving over into Yemen. We see this horrible situation in Libya. We see ISIS everywhere in the world. We see the Iranians now backing the Shia militias in Tikrit, where they're going to - where they're going to massacre a number of Sunnis. And it is - the guy in charge is a guy named Suleimani, who - who imported - excuse me - I will catch up here - Suleimani moved thousands of copper-tipped IEDs into Iraq and killed hundreds of American soldiers and Marines. And the president of the United States is praising the mullahs and their behavior in the region.\u201d\n\nMcCain on President Obama\u2019s message to the Iranian people: \u201cI wish he had spoken to the people of Iran in 2009, when they rose up against a corrupt election and he refused to speak out on their behalf while they were chanting \u2018Obama, Obama, are you with us or are you with them?\u2019 Again, does anyone - does he believe that anyone in Iran is able to speak up? Are they able to speak up for anything that the mullahs disagree with? They're either jailed or killed. Again, this is a view, a world view the president has which is totally divorced from reality.\u201d\n\nMcCain on Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination and the issue of race: \u201cMy response is that you can't erase history. These same Democrats led by Senator Durbin filibustered Janice Rogers Brown, the first African-American to the seat on that court - on that court. They filibustered Miguel Estrada. This has nothing to do with race. It has everything to do with trying to get legislation through which would prevent - or help prevent this horrible issue of sexual trafficking that is going on. And also I will add to that, I will not vote for her because she has said she would uphold the president's unconstitutional executive orders concerning immigration.\u201d\n\nTRANSCRIPT FULL POST",

Compact and economical, the new prototype has enabled the team to streamline the collection process.\n\nMeasuring 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter, Luigi comes equipped with a motor, pump and and filter.\n\nTo get the job done, the remote-controlled robot descends from street level to the waste water, where it captures bacteria by pumping water through a filtration system.\n\nAfter securing the samples, Luigi returns to street level for decontamination and processing.\n\n\"Usually the analysis of sewage is done in the treatment plants outside of cities, which loses accurate data due to transport time,\" says Ratti. \"But we're able to begin the filtration process of fecal and urinary matter in situ.\"\n\nCollecting a fresh sample is crucial, as gut bacteria start dying off as soon as they enter the sewer system.\n\nWhat lies beneath\n\nHuman fecal matter is a gold mine of information. But most of it comes down to the microbiome -- a collection of bacteria, virus and fungi that live on and inside our bodies which \"in general, acts as a mediator of the environment and our body,\" explains Alm.\n\nThe findings could potentially inform all kinds of health policy decisions.\n\n\"If the city decides to combat obesity by raising a tax on sugary drinks, it will take a long time to see if the policy changes are having an effect,\" explains Alm.\n\nBut with data from the microbiome, policymakers would have access to real-time feedback, enabling them to analyze the efficacy of health policies -- like a sugar tax, for example.\n\nIt would enable a city to pinpoint neighborhoods with patterns of drug usage or obesity, and address the problem on a granular level.\n\nAccording to Ratti, the long-term vision for Underworlds is to create a network of wastewater sampling robots that submit real-time data to a central command center -- like taking the pulse of the city's overall health.\n\nThe project is funded for 2.5 more years, after which the team hopes to scale up to cities around the world. Already, it has seen interest from municipal governments and NGOs in North America and Europe. Depending on how frequently a city wants to sample, Ratti said one robot per city could be enough.\n\nMIT has built 10 Luigi prototypes so far, with more to come this year.",

    "text": "Mark Schmitt, director of the program on political reform at New America, has worked in the U.S. Senate and was editor of The American Prospect. This is the seventh in a series, \"Big Ideas for a New America,\" in which the think tank New America spotlights experts' solutions to the nation's greatest challenges. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) If you want to have influence in the American political process, Michelle Obama in 2014 advised an audience, there's only one thing to do: \"Write a big, fat check...Write the biggest, fattest check that you can possibly write.\"\n\nThe only thing surprising about the first lady's statement is that a leading political figure said out loud something we all know. What she didn't say is that her advice doesn't work for everyone, to put it mildly.\n\nFor the vast majority of us, the \"biggest, fattest check\" we can write to a political campaign is probably in the low two digits, and many people can't even spare a few dollars. And that just isn't enough to influence the political process, to help your favorite candidate run a competitive campaign, or to get an issue you care about onto the agenda.\n\nAcademic research confirms this intuition. A 2013 study found that the top 0.01% of political donors -- just 24,000 people -- accounted for more than 40% of campaign contributions, up from about 10% in the 1980s. It is perhaps not a coincidence that the wealthiest 0.01% tripled their share of national income in the same time period.\n\nOther research, by political scientists Martin Gilens and Andrew Bartels, has shown that the policy preferences of the very wealthy consistently prevail over the preferences of middle-class and poor voters. Because of those \"big, fat checks,\" economic inequality crosses over into the political sphere, where the wealthy gain advantages that lock in their gains, threatening the vibrancy and growth of our economy.\n\nThe traditional approach to reducing the influence of economic inequality on democracy has been to limit those fat checks, by capping individual contributions, the total amount one person can give to campaigns, or outside spending intended to influence elections. It is those limits -- enacted into law after Watergate, and after the \"soft money\" scandals of the late 1990s -- that have been weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions such as Citizens United and McCutcheon.\n\nBut even without judicial intervention, the big checks and the people who can write them have always found ways to influence elections and policy. In a time of staggering inequality, the political influence of the very wealthy cannot easily be contained.\n\nWhat if we consider an alternative approach? Instead of trying to limit money, and failing -- let's empower everyone. What if everyone could write a check, not necessarily a fat one, but enough that, together with others, it could make it possible for people to run who don't have access to the very wealthy, or ensure that the concerns and preferences of ordinary voters carry at least some weight in the process?\n\nThis approach is the opposite of limits -- it aims to open up the system, and to encourage broader participation by citizens, not only as voters, but as volunteers and even donors. If politicians have a broad base of support, they will be far less dependent on the 0.01%, even though the big spenders will be out there.\n\nPoliticians will have as much reason to spend time with ordinary voters -- who might become donors -- as with the very wealthy. And it will be easier for a candidate who doesn't start with her own million-dollar bank account, or a cadre of rich friends or business allies to reach the point where she can be heard and potentially competitive.\n\nThere are several ways to use modest amounts of public funds to make this vision a reality, and all of them have been tested. One that seems to work well, in various states and cities, provides voluntary full public financing to candidates who show a broad base of support through small donations -- in other words, several thousand small checks turn into one big one, and candidates can stop; others, such as New York City, successfully encourage candidates to reach out to small donors by supplementing contributions of $175 or less with public funds\n\nBut many people can't even consider donating $50 or $175 in the hope that their views will be reflected in government. (For someone who earns the minimum wage, $175 is more than three days' pay.)\n\nTo make sure that everyone can have a voice in the dialogue of democracy, we should go further by establishing a system that gives everyone a small stake in the political marketplace. Legal scholars Bruce Ackerman and Lawrence Lessig have proposed to give everyone a voucher -- \"Patriot Dollars\" in Ackerman's term -- of $50 to give to any candidate or a political party\n\n\"Patriot Dollars\" or a similar system of vouchers would require building a new system to distribute and redeem the vouchers, and avoid fraud, but we could achieve much the same effect with a tax credit: Allow every adult to reduce the taxes they owe, or increase their refund, by the amount they contributed to campaigns, parties, or even small political organizations, up to $50.\n\nThe tax credit should be refundable, like the Earned Income Credit that encourages work, in order to the extend the benefits of political participation to everyone, including people who don't earn enough to pay federal income tax. Tax credits have traditionally had bipartisan support, including from conservatives who oppose most efforts to limit campaign money, and legislation to create a tax credit for political contributions was introduced by now-retired Republican Rep. Thomas Petri of Wisconsin.\n\nWhile the federal tax code included a credit for political giving in the 1970s and 1980s, the idea seems to have been forgotten, except in a few states. The best model for the design of a tax credit is Minnesota's Political Contribution Refund, which allows donors to collect their $50 immediately, simply by sending a receipt to the state revenue office.\n\nThe result is the exact reverse of the top 0.01% dominance that we see in federal elections: donations of $100 or less account for 45% of political funding in Minnesota, compared to less than 10% in 20 states, according to the Campaign Finance Institute.\n\nTax credits aren't the only way to moderate the influence of the very wealthiest on democracy, and they won't solve all the problems. With tax credits alone, a little-known candidate might have trouble raising enough money in very small donations to reach a competitive position.\n\nBut combining the tax credit with a system of matching funds, such as New York City's, or full public financing, would make those first dollars go further. And we'll still need limits on contributions to prevent the corruption that's likely when a politician owes his power to a few large donors.\n\nCall it the opportunity agenda for politics -- in which everyone has the opportunity to exercise the same kind of influence Michelle Obama was talking about. For Washington policymakers, the next steps include:\n\n-- Study state tax credit systems, like Minnesota's and Oregon's, and figure out what works and why.\n\n-- Combine tax credits with public financing, on the model of Rep. John Sarbanes' bipartisan Government By the People Act.\n\n-- Encourage private-sector technology innovations to help candidates, voters and organizations use the tax credit and make small donations easier.",

    "text": "(CNN) Editor's Note: Generation whining has become nearly a national pastime. Millennials say they have it the worst. Generation X feels neglected. Baby boomers are tired of being called narcissistic. In articles and cartoons everywhere -- from CNN to The New York Times to Gizmodo and beyond -- critics call out this generation's sense of entitlement, that generation's self-absorption . We invited writers, activists and CNN contributors from different generations to hash it out.\n\nJeff Yang: Generation X is bitter\n\nI belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We're the cohort everyone skips over \u2014 the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.\n\nYet, despite our generation's small size and overlooked status, we've nevertheless been handed the job of being America's cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we're raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution. In return, the world called us slackers. Is there any wonder we're bitter?\n\nJeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including PRI's \"The Takeaway\" and WNYC's \"The Brian Lehrer Show.\" He is the co-author of \"I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action.\"\n\nPaul Begala: Boomers, worst generation ever\n\nSixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire , \"The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history.\"\n\nNearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I'd like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever\n\nPaul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.\n\nIn the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds -- in blood and treasure -- has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)\n\nI'm at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.\n\nPhotos: 60 iconic moments from the 1960s 60 iconic moments from the 1960s \u2013 Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll defined the 1960s.

We've seemingly made \" changing the world \" with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world -- we're upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).\n\nDasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.\n\nBut in dismantling old models, we're also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It's harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won't necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.\n\nThis is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.\n\nOf course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.\n\nWe're faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.\n\nSo, take some pity on us when you're judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it's that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn't sit right.\n\nWe're the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.\n\nDasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global, a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.\n\nPepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation\n\nFor me, it's a tale of two cities.\n\nOne city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women's liberation.\n\nPepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.\n\nMost of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights -- we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.\n\nBut there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a \"cocktail,\" general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.\n\nOur generation was mixed. But I've been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.\n\nPhotos: 70 historic moments from the 1970s Pop culture and politics collided on December 21, 1970, when the King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley, visited President Richard Nixon in the White House Oval Office.

I've been told I don't text back fast enough to be a millennial -- but I also don't have Kurt Cobain's death circled (in black) on my calendar, so maybe I'm not so gen X. I can quote \"Reality Bites,\" a staple of the 30s to 40s set, but I also use Snapchat.\n\nI'm both and neither. Generation-adjacent. Floating in time.\n\nJohn Sutter's selfie at the Golden Gate Bridge in 2013, after he finished a reporting trip down the San Joaquin River in California.\n\nI think people in my situation -- the youngish-sorta-getting-older set -- define ourselves mostly in terms of what we're not. Which is to say that we're not boomers -- or anything the boomers say about us. They're so en-TITLED, so NEEDY, so stuck in their little gadgets or whatever. You've heard that junk for years. It's almost trite to repeat. But since boomers run the media and the job market, there seems to be no shortage of \"trend piece\" drivel about the vapid millennials and our shoddy work ethic. If the boomers took 10 minutes to listen, they'd notice that young people today have it worse. The job market's better but still rough; part-timing's the norm. This is the age of inequality, climate change and anti-immigrant sentiment. We millennial-adjacents may seem wayward and indecisive -- but we're light years ahead on all those issues.\n\nIt's the boomers holding us back. I mean -- it is, right?\n\nJohn D.

Then someone hiccuped and historians went generic: gen X, gen Y and gen Z.\n\nIf I were a member of generations X, Y or Z, I'd be miffed. Candidly, it's a wonder they don't suffer from an identity crisis. On top of bearing names as sterile as a supercomputer lab, they have to hear how they're all \"me, me, me,\" and (further) will be the first generations to do worse in America than their parents. All I can say is that I will take the blame for the world that generations X through Z inherited from us. But, please do remember, we have not only lived through the traumas of our times, but yours as well.\n\nFor all our faults, any generation that produced Dolly Parton, Elvis, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen -- not to mention Steve Jobs and Bill Gates \u2014 has to be considered the best. But I am sure some of my friends in the millennial generation would likely say the best is yet to come. Go ahead.

Cable news and the Internet didn't exist. Most music came from static ridden AM radios.\n\nIn school sports, not everybody made the team. Parents didn't \"helicopter\" their kids. College students traveled between home and school by hitchhiking to save money. We didn't believe in haircuts or the Vietnam War. Everyone was afraid the Russians were going to nuke us. People under 25 feared getting drafted into the military if they didn't volunteer. A lot of my friends did and many got killed.\n\nPaul Callan, from his Boston College Law School ID in 1975, when he was 25 years old.\n\nIn 1975, the starting salary for district attorneys in New York was $11,500 per year. When I began my legal career at the Brooklyn DA's Office, I didn't get a paycheck for six months because of New York City's financial crisis. The crime rate was three times higher than it is now and was handled by one-third the number of assistant district attorneys. We often worked nights and weekends for no extra pay. Didn't matter since we weren't getting paid anyway.\n\nAt work, there were \"typewriters,\" \"carbon paper\" for making copies and \"white out\" to correct errors. Spellcheck had not been invented. You had to get it right the first time or you would look like an idiot to the judge because of all the white out on your document. Public telephone calls were made from \"phone booths\": the place where Clark Kent changes into his Superman costume.\n\nCigarette smoke hung in the air everywhere as smoking was permitted in offices, bars, restaurants, buses, movie theaters, airplanes and even in courtrooms and hospitals.\n\nPeople who owned cars put \"No Radio\" signs on them because thieves smashed car windows and stole radios all the time. Replacing the glass was more expensive than the radio.\n\nIn 1977, New York's power system failed for over 24 hours and the city descended into a night of terror and looting.

It's pretty clear, for instance, that every generation wishes it could claim Bob Dylan. Boomers win on that one. Debating which generation had it tougher, however, depends.\n\nMatthew Segal providing testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in 2009.\n\nTo a certain extent, there have always been throngs of poor youngsters who work for minimum wage, toil as unpaid interns, or slog through as chronically underemployed baristas. What's alarming these days is the acute degree of income inequality Americans face: the highest since 1928. The house you are born into is much more likely to dictate your socioeconomic status than just about anything else.\n\nThe cost of college also matters -- a lot. Since 1978, university tuition has ballooned over 1000%. The notion of higher education has shifted. Ben Franklin, for example, saw it as a public good. Now it's seen more as a private commodity, financed largely through student loans. These loans are holding America back: A $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis means houses, cars and goods are less affordable for young Americans, and that in turn drags down our entire economy.\n\nMaybe we should compare ourselves to other countries where college is virtually free, or our friendly neighbors up north where upward mobility is on the rise, rather than previous or future generations in America.\n\nMatthew Segal is the co-founder of Attn.com and OurTime.org , advocacy organizations for young Americans.\n\nSarah Burris: Well, we all dislike Congress\n\nThe real reality that bites is that every generation was screwed by the economic dip, but every generation has an opportunity to try to fix it.\n\nMillennials are lucky in that we have nothing like the Great Depression or the World Wars.\n\nSarah Burris, third from left, in Chinatown with her friends.\n\nWe are the most diverse generation in American history. We are also incredibly progressive.\n\nWe are creative and have used our ideas to make new things. Boomers invented the Internet, generation X improved it, and millennials found how to bring people closer through it. Even though we join all other generations in hating the nonsense that is the U.S. Congress, we remain optimistic that government can be used as a tool to help people, or, if you're a \"Daily Show\" fan, something to laugh at.\n\nLike those who came before us we're neither better nor worse, good nor bad. We're different, and we bring different experiences and understanding to the table. There's no competition. We're in the same boat trying to do what we can with what we've got to make a better world.\n\nSarah Burris is a former editor at Future Majority.

    "text": "David A. Love writes for theGrio.com . He is a writer and human rights activist based in Philadelphia. Follow him @DavidALove . The views expressed are his own.\n\n(CNN) As Philadelphia comes to terms with the train derailment that has left six people dead and some 200 injured, it's also worth remembering another tragic event that took place in the city exactly 30 years ago. It was an incident that claimed the lives of almost a dozen people, including five children, and destroyed 61 homes . And it was undertaken by the city's own police force.\n\nWednesday marks the 30th anniversary of the infamous MOVE bombing, in which police fired 10,000 rounds of ammunition into a row house on the 6200 block of Osage Avenue in West Philadelphia. The police then dropped military-grade explosives on the house, burning an entire city block to the ground.\n\nFast forward to today, and that deadly, violent chapter provides valuable lessons for a society that so far has decided to ignore them.\n\nMOVE was a revolutionary black power group founded in 1972. The group had a \"back to nature,\" almost religious element to its lifestyle -- members were vegans and animal lovers, shunned technology, and wore their hair in dreadlocks. Their appearance and way of life led to conflict and tension in the community, and in a city with a long history of racism, police brutality, corruption and framings \u2014 and surveillance and harassment of political organizations such as the Black Panthers \u2014 the Philadelphia Police Department depicted MOVE as a terror threat.\n\nIn 1977, Mayor Frank Rizzo ordered a police barricade of MOVE headquarters. After 15 months, on August 8, 1978, the police moved in. One police officer was killed, in what Philadelphia Tribune reporter Linn Washington, who was on the scene, concluded was an act of police gunfire\n\nNine MOVE members were convicted of third degree murder, conspiracy and other charges, with sentences ranging between 30 and 100 years. They remain in prison. But three officers charged in the videotaped beating of a MOVE member were found not guilty.\n\nThis set the stage for the bombing seven years later, a sequence of events depicted in the 2014 PBS documentary, \"Let the Fire Burn.\"\n\nOn May 12, 1985, with the district attorney having prepared warrants to evict MOVE members from their home, police evacuated the entire block and told residents not to return for 24 hours. SWAT teams converged on the area, and gas and water lines were shut off.\n\nThe police pumped water and tear gas and later fired thousands of rounds of ammunition into the MOVE home, claiming MOVE had fired on police with automatic weapons, yet none of the four firearms found in the home were automatic weapons.\n\nAt the suggestion of a member of the police bomb squad, a state police helicopter dropped a bag of C-4 explosives on the roof of the MOVE home -- in a residential area.\n\nSix children were among the 13 people in the MOVE house during the bombing. Mayor Wilson Goode, then the city's first black mayor, later testified he was fully aware the device would be used but said he gave an order to put out the fire.\n\n\"Commissioner (Gregore) Sambor said to me, he said, 'Let's let the bunker burn, to eliminate that high ground advantage and that tactical advantage of the bunker,' and I said OK,\" testified Fire Commissioner William Richmond at a hearing after the bombing.\n\nSome of the officers involved in the 1978 MOVE operation were involved in the 1985 operation. It was also alleged that people who attempted to flee from the burning building, including children, were shot at by police.\n\nOnly two people -- one woman, Ramona Africa, and a child, Birdie Africa, also known as Michael Moses Ward -- survived the destruction of Osage Avenue. \"N****r lover\" was reportedly written on the police locker of James Berghaier, the officer who helped the burned child out of the house. Berghaier subsequently left the force due to a stress disorder\n\nA federal judge awarded the survivors $1.5 million , and a commission found that city officials were negligent and police training and supervision were lacking. However, no government officials or police officers were prosecuted for their role in the bombing.\n\nSadly, the MOVE bombing provided a preview of police state tactics that are commonplace today, and a militarization of local police forces, brought about by the wars on drugs and terror and funded by asset forfeiture and the feds. Indeed, law enforcement is using weaponry utilized by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under the Defense Department's 1033 program, along with similar Department of Justice and Homeland Security programs, the cops receive free surplus military arms, aircraft, Humvees, mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, you name it.\n\nGive wannabe soldiers with no training all the military hardware they want. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWell, people die, and children are endangered, such as 19-month old \"Bou Bou\" Phonesavanh, who was hit with a flash-bang grenade during a raid by police looking for drugs that did not exist. The child was placed in a medically induced coma, leaving the family with a $1 million medical bill.\n\nAddressing police militarization in the wake of events in Ferguson, Missouri, Sen. Claire McCaskill and Rep. William Lacy Clay, both Missouri Democrats, are introducing legislation to require more training and oversight for police departments receiving military equipment from federal programs and ban the use of certain surplus by local police.\n\nUnfortunately, the Fraternal Order of Police opposes any attempt to restrict the equipment used by law enforcement. This blue mentality that justifies and protects the police without criticism -- even as crime decreases -- threatens to further isolate the profession, as Radley Balko suggested recently in the Washington Post\n\nThirty years after MOVE, the concept of policing must change. A r ecent Department of Justice report found serious deficiencies in the Philadelphia police on policies and training on the use of deadly force and a lack of public trust in the police policing themselves.\n\nNoting an increase in police-involved shootings as crime has dropped, the report called for more police accountability and community oversight, independent and consistent investigations of police shootings, training in handling violent encounters and de-escalating tense situations.\n\nIn the meantime, black and brown communities across the country, particularly poor and working people, bear the brunt of heavy-handed police tactics. Regularly monitored and harassed, they are fearful and suspicious of police, and with good reason, because police behave like an occupying army in many of their neighborhoods.\n\nIt stands to reason that in white communities -- where law enforcement plays a different role -- police generally do not behave as they have carried on in the unrest in Ferguson last year, or Baltimore this year, or in West Philly in 1985. Yet the militarization of the police should concern everyone. Resisting the abuses of an oppressive government is an issue that should resonate with opposite ends of the political spectrum. Dismissing the victims of police brutality as violent black thugs who deserved their fate is delusional.\n\nUltimately, no one is safe if any one of us is not safe.\n\nAs in any police state, when the police become the army, they need an enemy, and the enemy ends up being us. \"To serve and protect\" is becoming \"to suppress and control.\"\n\nAnd with billions of dollars in military surplus, the police will find a way to use it.\n\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.",

Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) If you're new to the body-positive conversation, fat-shaming might feel like a buzz word -- but it's a real thing, and it has very real consequences. Fat people experience systemic prejudice that is on par with racism and sexism -- and by that I mean that statistical data documents that fat people are confronted with oppressive bias in economic, educational, medical, and social spaces.\n\nBeyond this, hatred of fat people like that expressed by Donald Trump is markedly understood by psychologists as contributing to low self-esteem, anxiety depression and suicidal behavior in young people.\n\nIn his career as a public figure, Trump has openly fat-shamed a number of women including Rosie O'Donnell, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado (most recently, twice in 24 hours). And, at the recent presidential debate, he conjured a visual on how cyber threats to national security might well be conducted by \"somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,\" a comment that, to say the least, reinforces negative ideas about fat people and their trustworthiness.\n\nJUST WATCHED Is the topic of weight Trump's go-to defense? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is the topic of weight Trump's go-to defense? 02:13\n\nMost of us already know that in general, Trump deals in insults and degradation. Demeaning fat people, representing them as \"less than,\" is one of the terrible tools in his arsenal.\n\nThat said, unlike all the other verbal violence that Trump deploys, there is something really weird about his distaste for us larger-bodied folk: his failure to realize that he's a fat man.\n\nDONALD TRUMP IS A FAT MAN.\n\nTo be clear, when I call Trump fat I mean him no insult -- because as far as I am concerned fat is a neutral descriptor, a term that deals only in simple facts\u2014akin to noting I have brown eyes and brown hair. Assuming fatness as bad is a byproduct of a culture that already is on board with Trump's thinking, positioning some -- in this case thin people - as deserving of respect, and positioning others as unworthy of kindness, care and equal treatment.\n\nYou would think that Trump, as a person of increased girth, might get it that representing people with fat bodies as slovenly, unmotivated, disgusting, unruly and amoral is a product of bias, but in this case no such luck. Trump's failure to realize that demeaning fatness is an insult to himself may be part of his much larger issue of personal denial and an inability to differentiate between truth and self-serving falsifications.\n\nObviously, I am not a Trump supporter. I'm a believer in pursuing social justice for all people. Human dignity and human success require a life and a politics that favor individual generosity and national prosperity over personal greed. As far as I can tell, the Trump team doesn't value the many over the few. Trump is divisive; he motivates loyalty with fear and encourages hatred. I find him to be unfit for office.\n\nAnd yet, a month or so ago when life-sized naked Trump replicas were turning up around the country and people were jesting about the fatness of this man who, terrifyingly, wants to be president - I didn't laugh. It doesn't matter if I detest everything that Trump stands for, we cannot allow ourselves to slip into the trap of brandishing his fatness as a symbol of his hatefulness.\n\nThe October 10, 2016 cover of the New Yorker\n\nA recent cover of The New Yorker parodied Trump by presenting him as Miss Congeniality. The image presents Trump as a failed fat beauty queen, teary-eyed in heels and a swimsuit; it is already the veritable 'talk of the town' because it is calling attention to his hypocrisy. In this moment, it's important to remember that beneath this joke at Trump's expense are sexist and fat-shaming ideas.\n\nTo shame and pigeon-hole anyone based on appearance is wrong. Perhaps you remember this -- it was something we all learned in kindergarten or maybe even earlier. Then, we proceeded to carve out lives in a world that perpetuates body-policing of all kinds and lost sight of the fact that mean-spirited comments have repercussions.\n\nShift the script. Step away from oversimplified stereotypes that make negative assumptions about fatness and fat people.\n\nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter. We welcome your ideas and comments.\n\nTrump shows disrespect towards people of all kinds. Give him a microphone and within minutes something racist, sexist, homophobic or xenophobic is bound to spill forth. So, his complete disregard for the consequences of treating fat people with demeaning brutality is no surprise.\n\nWhat IS a surprise? That so many Americans believe that this bully, badly in need of a serious dose of moral guidance, should be president -- that's flabbergasting.\n\nSo, no, don't fat-shame Trump. We are better than that.",

Years later, that knowledge would reconnect him to his homeland in a distinctive way.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton's new plan to help small business owners\n\nMohebi is the co-founder of Aria Gems, a company that mines and exports Panjshir emeralds. While its mining operations are in Afghanistan, the business is headquartered in New York, and its gem processing and cutting center in Fargo, N.D. There, the rough emeralds are turned into polished stones.\n\nSince it launched in 2013, Aria Gems has become one of the largest suppliers of legally-mined Panjshir emeralds, having shipped more than 30,000 Carats of the stone.\n\nIt also owns three underground mines and four acres of surface area emerald deposits in Panjshir Valley.\n\nRelated: How a free Super Bowl ad turned Death Wish Coffee into a household name\n\nMohebi's entrepreneurial journey, however, didn't start with gems. He left Afghanistan for the U.S. in the 1980s, shortly after Russia invaded the country. He settled in Atlanta and opened a tailoring business.\n\nThat's where he met co-founder Forrest Snowden, a technologist working with IBM at the time, who frequented the shop. The two became friends.\n\n\"I knew nothing about Afghanistan, but I lived in the middle of an Afghan-American community in Atlanta at the time,\" Snowden said. \"Every Friday, I'd sit with him at his shop and talk about his culture over a cup of tea.\"\n\nIn return, Mohebi persistently asked Snowden to start a company together that could help rebuild Afghanistan.\n\nAfter Snowden left his job, he took up Mohebi's challenge. Along with Mohebi's brother Jamil, the trio first launched Aria Global Logistics in 2009.\n\nThe startup helped facilitate U.S. federal contracts for construction, transportation and logistic development in Afghanistan. It later entered into joint ventures with local Afghan construction companies.\n\n\"Our business was doing well,\" Snowden said. \"Habib later told me about the emerald mines in Panjshir Valley. In 10 years of knowing him, he never [mentioned them before].\"\n\n\"I immediately made a business case for the global trade of emeralds and other gemstones in Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nRelated: This startup wants to prevent another Flint water crisis\n\nCurrently, the world's top emerald mining countries of Brazil, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Colombia -- which occupies the biggest piece of the mining pie -- produce a bulk of the global supply. Together, the countries bring in about $1.4 billion worth of gems annually.\n\nBy contrast, Afghanistan sells about $50 million worth of Panjshir emeralds annually.\n\n\"Most of it is in illegal trade,\" said Snowden, adding that both sellers and miners are usually underpaid for the value of the gems.\n\nSaid Mubin Shah, commercial attache with the Afghan Embassy on Washington, D.C. said the country's gems industry also lacks regulation and safety protocols.\n\n\"In Afghanistan, there is a grave issue of lack of education,\" said Shah. \"There are many people in the gems industry who are unlicensed, unprofessional and extracting gems illegally.\"\n\nIn the Pajshir Valley, the emerald mines are owned and operated by community elders. \"It's been that way for generations,\" said Snowden.\n\nBut mining often involves explosives: \"[It's] not only dangerous, the process also fractures the stone,\" he added.\n\nIn 2013, Snowden and Mohebi launched their second business, Aria Gems, as a part of an effort to legally trade Panjshir emeralds in global markets.\n\nThe team only mines in areas free from conflict.\n\n\"We wanted to help the miners learn safer modern techniques that wouldn't damage the stone,\" said Mohebi. \"[And] we're training men and women how to cut and polish the stone, too.\"\n\nThe company continues to have ambitious plans for its gems business.\n\nBy making the illegal gems trade in Afghanistan legal, Aria Gems wants to create more jobs in the country and generate more income.\n\n\"We want to put Panjshir emeralds on the map,\" said Snowden. \"There's no reason why Afghanistan can't one day be second to Colombia in emerald mining.\"",

    "text": "What's one billion users when you can go after two billion?\n\nFacebook announced on Monday a slimmed down version of its popular messaging app called Messenger Lite, designed for users with slower internet speeds in emerging markets.\n\nThe app caters to lower-end Android devices and takes up as little as 10 MB on smartphones and tablets. Facebook's standard Messenger app requires 125 MB.\n\nMessenger Lite rolls out Monday in Kenya, Tunisia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Venezuela. It will become available in other countries in the coming months.\n\nWhile Messenger Lite will allow users to send text, photos and links to anyone using Messenger or Messenger Lite, it does not include advanced features like audio and video calls found on Messenger.\n\nRelated: Can Facebook save endangered languages?\n\nThe move is a part of Facebook's greater effort to get more users online worldwide. The company's Internet.org division is also behind the Free Basics app, which provides free internet access to cellphone users in underserved countries. The app gives users access to content topics such as employment and health care information.\n\nFacebook (FB, Tech30) has also invested a lot in messaging apps over the years. In 2014, it acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion and faced frustration from users when it forced its messaging capabilities out of its main app, forcing them to download a separate app.\n\nEven as these messaging apps experience tremendous growth -- both apps crossed the billion user mark this year -- some analysts have started to question how or when investors might ever see a return on this investment.\n\nDespite Messenger becoming the second most popular iOS app of all time, according to App Annie, it still has no significant source of revenue.\n\n\"Right now, we aren't focused on monetizing across Messenger, we're just trying to build the best experiences we can for people and businesses,\" Stan Chudnovsky, Facebook's Head of Product for messaging, tells CNNMoney.\n\nWhile many tech companies have struggled to monetize messaging, some Asian businesses have been more successful. In fact, Line -- a Japanese messaging app which went public earlier this year -- raked in nearly $270 million in revenue from digital stickers last year alone.\n\nFacebook hasn't been able to duplicate that sticker success, but it has started to lay the groundwork for monetizing messaging through \"bots.\"\n\nThe social network hopes customers start interacting with brands via automated conversations through Messenger. In theory, Facebook could start charging businesses to interact with its users on the platform.",

The second million required only 21 months.\n\nCar2go, a Daimler subsidiary that launched in 2009, announced Tuesday that it has reached the two million member milestone. Every 1.5 seconds a member takes a trip in one of its 14,000 vehicles in 30 cities across nine countries.\n\nThe company doesn't say if it's profitable, but the rapid uptick in membership points to a broad enthusiasm for the sharing economy, and a shift in how the world accesses transportation.\n\nRelated: How car-sharing is already helping cities with their transit issues\n\nWith Car2go, customers paying a one-time $35 membership fee can rent a vehicle parked on a nearby public street and leave it elsewhere in their city. There's no need to reserve a vehicle ahead of time, or return it to a designated parking lot. Car2go cuts deals with local governments so that its vehicles can be parked in public spots.\n\nThe company began service in its first Asian city, Chongqing, in April. The interest in China has been unprecedented -- Car2go has signed up 113,000 customers in less than six months. The membership base in Chongqing has nearly surpassed Car2go's fifth most popular city, Vancouver, which launched in April 2011.\n\nThe company's most popular cities are Berlin and Hamburg, both of which have more than 130,000 members.\n\nCar2go's fleet of vehicles are mostly two-seater Smart cars. They leave little room for cargo, but are easy to park in cities. The company has branched out some, adding four-door Mercedes-Benz sedans and SUVs in its European fleet.",

I feel you can enjoy going out a lot more now,\" says local Otto Gumaelius, who lives in East London's Whitechapel neighborhood.\n\n\"The Night Tube is just what London needs; now the city gets a chance to keep New York hours,\" says Kitchen Journeys blogger Madeline Morrow.\n\nThough such major changes could have consequences for restaurant in terms of staff costs, recruitment and capacity, the reception's been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nJUST WATCHED London: The city that never sleeps? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH London: The city that never sleeps? 01:21\n\nAntonio Polledri, who runs the family-owned cafe Bar Italia in Soho, a late-night haunt long before the Tube's nocturnal extension, says it's good for customers and employees alike.\n\n\"Our staff along with other people who work night shifts in the service industry will no doubt benefit from the Night Tube,\" he says.\n\n\"It has been a long time coming for one of the most exciting, vibrant and cosmopolitan cities in the world,\" says VQ Restaurants founder Simon Prideaux, who owns two 24-hour diners in the city in addition to a new third branch open until 3 a.m. everyday.\n\n\"It's great to be a part of London's booming nighttime economy, and we look forward to welcoming more night owls.\"\n\nIf you ever feel peckish on a weekend well after the clock strikes midnight along the Central and Victoria lines (the Jubilee line service starts October 7, with more to follow), here's a sample of where to nosh on a late night in London.\n\nEach option is within walking distance of a current Night Tube station.\n\nDuck & Waffle\n\nLate-night eating doesn't have to mean poor quality.\n\nNearest Tube Station: Liverpool Street, Central line\n\nWeekend Hours: 24 hours, limited menu from 5 a.m. - 6 a.m.\n\nLondon's highest 24-hour restaurant might also be the city's poshest for around-the-clock dining.\n\nAccessing the upscale restaurant and bar involves an ear-popping ascent 40 floors up Heron Tower, but patrons are rewarded with stunning city views some 230 meters above the Thames.\n\n\"I think [the Night Tube service] may change the demographic of who comes, rather than the volume of people coming through the doors,\" says Dan Doherty, the chef who helped craft the restaurant's namesake dish from crispy leg confit, fried duck egg and mustard maple syrup.\n\n\"People in different areas now have the chance to come without lengthy bus journeys or pricey cabs.\"\n\nDuck and Waffle, 110 Bishopsgate 40th Floor, Heron Tower, London England;\n\nBar Italia\n\nNearest Tube Stations: Tottenham Court Road, Central line\n\nWeekend Hours: 7 a.m. - 5 a.m.\n\nBar Italia is one of the city's most beloved cafes, having first opened in 1949, and continues to bring the buzz in a very happening, dense section of the central Soho district.\n\nThough wholly inclusive and inexpensive, Bar Italia remains a draw for celebrities, musicians and athletes to this day.\n\n\"People love coming to Bar Italia because it's still [in its] original, iconic 1940s condition,\" boasts Antonio Polledri, the cafe's third-generation restaurateur who's \"keeping it in the family\" on behalf of original husband and wife founders Lou and Caterina Polledri.\n\nThough light bites, pizza and paninis are available, Bar Italia's calling card is their Gaggia machine-pumped coffee, which is the family's secret blend... though many might not need such an energy boost at 4:30 a.m. on a Saturday.\n\nBar Italia, 22 Frith Street, London W1D 4RP England;\n\nBalans Cafe\n\nNearest Tube Station: Tottenham Court Road, Central line\n\nWeekend Hours: 24 hours\n\nA Soho dining legend, Balans Cafe has provided booze and food for convivial guests for decades.\n\nLike its neighboring sister with a slightly shorter curfew (Balans Soho Society), Balans was given a recent full-on facelift, but classic dishes such as the Infamous Balans Burger and 12 oz sirloin steak remain a fixture for the cafe.\n\nWith the recent advent of the Night Tube, this fun and flirty 24-hour spot's already seen an uptick on the amount of people arriving after midnight.\n\n\"No one wants to stick to a timetable when you're out for the night.

Former London local Faisal Nisar explains, \"If you manage to finish the Green Chili Cheeseburger, Chili Dog and Chili Cheese Fries in under 10 minutes, it's all free and you'll walk out a rich man.

It's a huge slice of NYC-cool in the heart of Shoreditch,\" declares Stacey Smith, founder of London food blog Crummbs.\n\nThe upmarket pizzeria is housed in a former tea warehouse turned trendy commercial space (Tea Building) and serves gourmet, individual-size pizzas such as \"nduja, pickled peppers, red onion, scamorza\" (\u00a312 / $15) and \"leeks, puzzone, egg, rosemary, cream\" (\u00a311 / $14).\n\nBeyond the wood oven pies, Pizza East also has antipasti selections and baked dishes from beef lasagne to salt-baked salmon.\n\n\"While you nearly always have to queue, the turnaround is pretty quick. Order a plate of charcuterie and a tumbler of red [wine] while you wait,\" says Stacey.",

    "text": "Story highlights A former Donald Trump tax adviser said the presidential candidate had no role in preparing tax returns\n\nA 1995 tax return revealed Trump had declared a $916 million loss that year\n\n(CNN) A former tax adviser to Donald Trump said the Republican presidential candidate had \"virtually zero\" role in reporting a nearly $916 million loss, a move that meant the real estate mogul could be exempt from paying federal taxes for nearly two decades.\n\nJack Mitnick told CNN's Kate Bolduan and John Berman on \"At This Hour\" that Trump's tax returns -- including those revealed in a New York Times report over the weekend -- were prepared by a separate financial team, rather than by Trump himself.\n\nMitnick dodged on a question on whether or not Trump had filed similar losses at other times during his career, citing his allegiance to \"codes of ethics of two professions\" -- he's an accountant and an attorney.\n\nHe said, however, Trump acted well within legal bounds in his 1995 tax filings.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) Forget Gangnam style. There's a new area of Seoul that, if the South Korean government gets its way, is about to become synonymous with K-pop.\n\nOnce a rundown district, Changdong is being transformed into a mecca to K-pop -- the manufactured music genre that has taken Asia by storm.\n\nSales of Korean music, and related TV shows, films, animations, games and other publishing, earned the country nearly $5 billion in 2015, according to a Korean Trade Investment Promotion Agency report.\n\nNow the Seoul government is leveraging the \"hallyu wave\" -- as this cultural phenomenon has been dubbed -- to revive Changdong.\n\n\"From the Korean perspective, the hallyu-Korean wave, the K-pop wave, it's not just music, it's not just dramas,\" Cuz Potter, an associate professor in urban planning at the Korea University Graduate School of International Studies, in Seoul, tells CNN.\n\n\"It's the whole soft power of Korean goods.\"\n\nSeoul gentrification\n\nChangdong district, a relatively small residential commuter area, lies on the northern outskirts of Seoul. Home to a few hundred thousand people, it's an area that's growing but which has little cultural facilities or industry.\n\nCity planners hope that K-pop can do for Changdong what the Beatles did for Liverpool in the UK -- indeed, what PSY has done for Gangnam, in Seoul -- attracting both locals and tourists into the area, who could bring jobs and spending power with them.\n\nJUST WATCHED New K-pop dance craze lures foreigners to South Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New K-pop dance craze lures foreigners to South Korea 01:53\n\nConcert halls, a music school, recording studios, art galleries, a K-pop museum and policies to encourage \"pop musicians to move into the area\" are all part of the plan, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Government.\n\nA 20,000-seat multi-cultural entertainment arena is slated for completion by 2021, with a range of other supporting facilities to follow.\n\n\"Since the 1980s, the population in Changdong has increased rapidly. There was almost no cultural center so (it was) decided to have the arena set up first ... and turn it into a youth and art complex,\" Kim Dong Cheol, leader of the Seoul Metropolitan Government arena team, tells CNN.\n\nWork has already begun on the project, while Platform Changdong 61 -- a smaller cultural center built out of brightly-colored shipping containers, which features a concert hall, a recording studio, art galleries, cafes and retail stores -- opened in April.\n\nPlatform Changdong 61 is the first K-pop cultural development to be built in Changdong.\n\nThe K-pop effect\n\nPotter says this type of urban development is common in Seoul -- a sprawling, modern metropolis, with a population of 10 million people in the city center, and 30 million regionally.\n\nMany other parts of the city have been regenerated by turning them into a cultural hub, although none have yet used K-pop as the foundation.\n\nJUST WATCHED South Korea uses pop music as a weapon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH South Korea uses pop music as a weapon 01:51\n\n\"This idea that the government would step in and create a major hub is something that's a familiar strategy for the Korean and the Seoul government,\" says Potter.\n\n\"Gangnam itself was created in a similar kind of way in the 70s. They decided they were going to develop it intensively in order to get middle class and upwards people to move in that direction and forcibly moved all sorts of cultural institutions, in particular schools and universities, to support this strategy.\"\n\nIt eventually become the Beverly Hills of Seoul, inspiring PSY to write his worldwide smash \"Gangnam Style\".\n\nK-pop pull\n\nIt may seem gimmicky, and even a risk, to chance the revival of an entire area on the strength of K-pop, but the towering economic power of this industry gives city planners confidence.\n\nAside from hallyu's export earnings, officials have carefully harnessed the recognition and respect popular culture has generated for South Korea to drive other industries, such as sales of industrial goods, including semi-conductors, and consumer goods, like electronics and cars.\n\n\"One of the other statistics that the Korean government has been working off is that for every $1 spent on the cultural industry you get $5 worth of sales of Korean cars or white goods or things like that,\" Keith Howard, a Korean music and culture professor from the University of London, tells CNN.\n\nAnd although the main overseas hallyu markets are in China, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, K-pop has gained traction in the West in the past decade, thanks to government policies geared to foreign expansion. The US was the third largest market for overseas K-pop concerts from January 2013 to March 2016, according to Billboard magazine\n\n\"It's a strategic thing ... there was a shift towards soft culture and it was led by (former president) Kim Dae-jung,\" says Howard.\n\n\"It was a very deliberate policy to make Korea cool, to brand Korea through its popular culture and the South Korean government did promote that culture abroad and it continues to do so.\"\n\nChangdong style\n\nFrom an urban redevelopment perspective, Potter and Howard both say the Changdong project \"probably\" has good economic sense behind it, if solely for the pulling power it will have with tourists.\n\nPotter notes that the district is ideally located, at the end of a subway line that connects to the tourist shopping area of Myeong-dong. Plus, Howard says, more people visit Korea for popular culture than they do to see historic sites.\n\nIt could be K-pop's biggest challenge yet.",

Hamilton has been nominated for her solo exhibition \"Lichen! Libido! (London!) Chastity!\", which first showed at SculptureCenter, New York.\n\nSome 200 years ago, Goya famously painted a firing squad; here was a contemporary equivalent in the flesh. A woman from the Tate press office was quickly instructed where to stand, lens caps were removed and the photographers began firing away.\n\nThe London Evening Standard was first with the story a few hours later with the headline \"Bottoms Up.\" The Guardian went with \"bleak and baffling but no bum deal,\" and the Times with \"Big ideas and empty bombast hit a bum note.\"\n\nAfter the heady days of the 1990s, the Turner Prize has arguably struggled to maintain its profile.\n\nThis deliberately playful (and surrealist) buttocks piece is by the British artist, Anthea Hamilton, and is entitled \"Project for a Door.\" She was inspired by a 1970s design for a New York apartment block entrance that was never built.\n\nHamilton actively likes to collaborate with others. The work was fabricated in Sussex and painted in skin tones by an expert from London's Madame Tussauds . The show's lead curator, Linsey Young, merrily referred to the space as the \"Butt Room.\"\n\nThe man's hands, I noticed, were cupping his cheeks rather precisely (and symmetrically), apparently prizing them apart. Was he about to unleash a fart into the Butt Room? -- I wondered indelicately. \"No,\" said the curator firmly, \"he wasn't.\"\n\nThe Turner Prize legacy\n\nSo here we all were again; another year and another Turner Prize exhibition.\n\nThis December, the prize will be awarded for the 32nd time -- \u00a325,000 (about $36,000) to the winner, \u00a35000 each to three runners-up. The rules have been settled for some time -- artists must be British and under the age of 50 and the exhibited work recent.\n\nI've been to a lot of Turner Prize press shows; for 16 years, from 1993 to 2009, I've never missed one and these were undeniably newsworthy years -- the prize demanding and deserving attention. And at least three winners created work so memorable that it was talked about well beyond what one Turner winner, the Essex transvestite potter Grayson Perry , refers to as \"the art mafia.\"\n\nThere was Damien Hirst' s Shark -- \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\" (both the original tiger shark and its later substitute). What London taxi-driver didn't have an opinion about the shark? For a fleeting moment, \"formaldehyde\" entered the popular vocabulary and newspaper cartoonists made fun of politicians by suspending them in vitrines.\n\nI happened to witness the manufacture and erection (another good word) of Antony Gormley 's splendid rusting steel \"Angel of the North\" that overlooks a motorway near Gateshead in the north of England.\n\nJust as memorably, there was the monumental creation of Rachel Whiteread's \"House,\" her interior cast of the last terrace house standing on a patch of grass in the East End of London. At the insistence of the local council, \"House\" was demolished. I still have a relic -- a small gray concrete shard, bearing the partial imprint of a door panel.\n\nLike them or not, the Shark, the Angel and \"House\" were artworks that were instantly written into Art History -- capital \"A,\" capital \"H.\" And some of the artists found collectors and fame and became rich. Last year, The Guardian estimated Damien Hirst's wealth at \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion).\n\nAfter the heady days of the 1990s, the Turner Prize has arguably struggled to maintain its profile, has some years perhaps felt a little jaded. With over 140 artists nominated since the first prize in 1984, how good could all of them be?\n\nTurner Prize 2016\n\nThis year, for the first time, the BBC is the prize's media partner and that should help spread the word. And for the second year, the head of the jury is Tate Britain's enthusiastic new director, Alex Farquharson , in his mid-40s.\n\nSo how was he rising to the challenge of reinvigorating the Turner Prize? \"The artists keep it fresh\" was his quick response. \"Art keeps moving. There are no one-liners now.\" This was \"a very exciting year -- the work capricious, seductive, poetic.\" As he saw it, the nature and trajectory of contemporary art had changed. It was now about \"the liquidity of images and objects, about the internet, about shape-shifting and the art of retrieval.\"\n\nThis was immediately apparent from the first room in the new show.\n\nLike some archaeological storeroom, the space had been filled by the youngest of the nominees, 31-year-old Helen Marten with multiple handmade and found objects -- an idiosyncratic detritus of fish bones, python skins, coins, a textile magic lamp, cotton buds, iron building nails, dried lemon peel -- all neatly laid out on shelves and chipboard and oddly shaped work stations. Her work clearly invites you to look and look again more closely.\n\nMarten has said -- ''as an artist, there is no policing of fantasy.\" As intended, the work was full of visual riddles. \"We are\" -- she has said \"archaeologists of our own time.\"\n\nAn art installation by artist Josephine Pryde.\n\nAt the heart of Josephine Pryde 's practice is photography -- she's a professor of photography in Berlin and, at 49, the oldest of the four nominees. Along one wall, she'd hung a series of photographs of manicured female hands -- nails painted in brightly colors -- holding objects like iPhones and pens. A perfect miniature diesel locomotive runs through her space, disappointingly stopped in its tracks; there were evidently leaves on the line. In previous Pryde exhibitions, the train has moved and carried gallery visitors two or three at a time. Here the train is entitled \"The New Media Express in a Temporary Siding (Baby wants a Ride).\" I definitely would have loved a ride. The old media snapped happily away at the locomotive as their willing model marched up and down alongside the track.\n\nVisitors view an installation of artworks by artist Michael Dean.\n\nIn the final room, Michael Dean 's work stopped me in my tracks -- an arresting and simple idea, wonderfully executed. Spread across the floor, like so much metallic scree, was a heap of British one penny coins -- to be precise \u00a320,436 ($26,605) -- the annual income for a family of four living on what the British government deems the national poverty line. For many of us Brits, pennies are just loose change of frankly little or no use. The artwork presented the shocking reality -- pennies do have value -- and here, a slurry of them to keep a family alive. Dean has surrounded his pennies with upstanding sculptures, made of materials like concrete, corrugated sheeting and chain mail fencing. The white box of his exhibition space has been powerfully transformed into a landscape of decay, of a world falling apart.\n\nWomen in art\n\nThis year (as was the case last year), three of the four nominated artists are women. Three of the five jury members are women. The Tate curatorial team of four who put on the show are all women. Alex Farquharson hoped he'd seen \"an end to inequality in the profile between male and female artists, maybe for the first time in history.\" Up to now, about 75% percent of Turner Prize Winners have been men although frankly I wouldn't bet against Michael Dean winning this year.\n\nI left Tate Britain pleasantly mystified and invigorated but also thirsting for a good old fashioned artistic fix of beauty. The Frith Gallery in Golden Square is showing new work by Tacita Dean, a Turner Prize nominee from 1998.\n\nDean has made a short, intimate film about the 79-year-old David Hockney, smoking in his studio.\n\nIt's an affectionate, non-judgmental portrait of a famous smoking zealot. And it made me laugh. \"It's very very enjoyable smoking,\" he muses to himself taking another long slow death-defying drag. In a static close-up, you can't help but worry for the state of Hockney's lungs. But like J.M.W Turner (from whom the Turner takes its name), Dean has also turned to cloudscapes -- fragile and exquisite chalk, gouache and white charcoal drawings on old Victorian school slates. They are simply breath-taking.",

    "text": "Meet the new Google, same as the old Google, but a little less freewheeling.\n\nOne year ago this week, Google (GOOGL, Tech30) officially formed a new holding company called Alphabet to organize its many ambitious projects. Its venture capital arms, life sciences division, moonshot lab and Google itself each became independent entities with their own CEOs, operating under the Alphabet umbrella.\n\nFor those who work in Google's core Internet business, not much changed. The word \"Alphabet\" is rarely brought up in conversation today. The offices remain filled with perks. Sundar Pichai, the well-liked executive who ran much of Google before the restructuring, now serves as Google's CEO.\n\nThe biggest difference may be that Google's leadership can better focus on the future of Google's consumer products -- some of which are expected to be unveiled at a media event on Tuesday -- without discussing far flung plans to develop smart contact lenses.\n\nRelated: Google launches Allo -- a messaging app that'll make Facebook jealous\n\nBut for Alphabet divisions not named Google, the change has been more noticeable, according to interviews with current and former employees who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing relationships with the company.\n\nLarry Page, the cofounder and previous CEO of Google, now spends more of his time offering guidance to Alphabet's experimental groups like self-driving cars, according to former employees.\n\nThe founder's involvement shows Alphabet's commitment to these groups, but there is a downside. Under Alphabet, and CFO Ruth Porat, there is more focus on accountability and managing costs. That has created tensions with some employees who thought Google offered the chance to work on ambitious projects without worrying about the company's bottom line.\n\nAt Verily, Alphabet's health research group, employees are now partly compensated with a new class of Verily stock, according to a former employee. It's intended as an incentive to grow the division and share in the financial returns just like with a typical startup. Not everyone embraced it.\n\n\"Some people were like, 'I didn't sign up for this risk, because in theory this Verily stock could go to zero and that's not why I signed up for Google,'\" the former employee says.\n\nAt Nest, the smart home device maker that Google acquired in 2014 for $3.2 billion, executives were initially promised the freedom to innovate without worrying about Google, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter the creation of Alphabet, however, Nest employees felt pressure from above to cut costs, the source says. More than that, Nest was forced to begin paying for legal and public relations services previously covered by Google.\n\nAndrea Faville, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment for this story.\n\nRelated: Google's latest moonshot? Its soaring stock\n\nIt's a far cry from the old days at Google. For years, costly new experiments were funded by the company's incredible success making money from online advertising -- and losses from these projects were not broken out for investors to scrutinize.\n\nNow Alphabet lists sales and losses from its moonshot projects with a category in its financial statements called \"Other Bets.\" That segment's losses rose to $859 million in the quarter ending in June.\n\nWesley Chan, a longtime Google executive who left the company the year before it became Alphabet, remembers Google giving away an estimated $200 million worth of coupons to users to find traction for its commerce efforts, with limited success. Profitability and cost management weren't top concerns.\n\n\"When you had Google's cash cow coming in, you had the liberty of doing things that weren't quite possible,\" Chan says. That may not have been a winning pitch for Wall Street, but it did open the door for more bold experimentation.\n\n\"There's still people that feel there's some boldness there,\" Chan says of people working at Google now, \"but it's grown up.\"\n\nPage hinted at the need for shifting Google's approach in his original letter announcing the restructuring, saying the goal was to make the company \"cleaner and more accountable.\"\n\nInvestors have generally cheered this way of thinking. Alphabet's stock has soared in the last year. It overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world on multiple occasions.\n\nBut there have been growing pains internally.\n\nGoogle has reportedly pushed Fiber, its high-speed Internet division, to cut half its staff. Boston Dynamics, an advanced robotics project that it acquired, is said to be up for sale.\n\nJust in the first year, Alphabet has lost top executives from several key projects, including Tony Fadell at Nest, Bill Maris at Google Ventures and Chris Urmson with Google's self-driving car group.\n\nPorat, the Alphabet CFO who was brought in to manage costs and appeal to Wall Street, has stressed on recent investor calls that the company can develop \"new sources of revenue growth\" from its various projects \"in a disciplined way.\"\n\n\"My concern is are they still maintaining the font of creativity and experiments that they want to,\" says Frank Gillett, an analyst with Forrester. \"I'm not clear that the new model is the right way to do that.\"",

The IBF contract for the fight stipulated that the winner would need to face Vyacheslav Glazkov as a mandatory challenger.\n\nThe months since have been filled with storms of controversy.\n\nAlleged sexist and homophobic comments, self-confessed drug use and a swiftly-reversed announcement of retirement have followed each other in rapid succession, with the 28-year-old in the spotlight for reasons that often had little to do with pugilism.\n\nTyson Fury poses with his heavyweight belts in happier times.\n\n'It has been a witch hunt'\n\nFury has no doubt that his heritage has been used against him, telling Rolling Stone magazine : \"It's been a witch hunt ever since I won that world title, because of my background, because of who I am and what I do.\"\n\nAnd Joseph Jones of the Gypsy Council, which works on behalf of Britain's Gypsies and Travelers, told CNN: \"If you look at the way he's been treated, I think it is hard not to think that.\"\n\nFury told the magazine he was battling depression and had been using alcohol and cocaine but was now sober.\n\nHe said: \"If I could take my own life -- and I wasn't a Christian -- I would take it in a second. I just hope someone kills me before I kill myself. I'll have to spend eternity in hell.\"\n\nHe explained that he felt there was \"hatred for Travelers and Gypsies around the world\" -- Amnesty International has found widespread discrimination against Roma Gypsies -- and said that hostility had fueled his depression.\n\nFury's representatives did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on this story.\n\nBritain's Traveler community, some 40,000 strong, has always been a boxing stronghold (Fury's father was a bare-knuckle fighter) and also produced middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders, who this month told the BBC : \"I have known Tyson all my life. I have never seen him this low.\"\n\nSoon as I get better I'll be defending what's mine the heavyweight thrown. pic.twitter.com/LaUjlg4dB2 \u2014 GYPSYKING, (@Tyson_Fury) 3 October 2016\n\n'Tyson Fury hasn't been celebrated'\n\nJones said he believed attitudes to Fury's background had exacerbated his problems, saying the fighter's achievements have never been acknowledged in the way they would have been had his circumstances been different.\n\n\"A few years ago, this country would have given anything for a heavyweight boxing champion,\" he added. \"It's not often that you get someone with that prowess. But Tyson Fury hasn't been celebrated.\n\n\"Nobody has ever really respected him for being world champion and beating Klitschko, who is a phenomenal boxer. He has never had proper recognition and that has hurt him, I think.\n\n\"Yes, he will go down in the history books as heavyweight champion -- but the attitude towards him and what he has achieved won't change.\"\n\nJones acknowledged that Fury had \"said some controversial things,\" but added: \"If he'd been world champion but from another background, people would have respected him even if he said things that were daft.\n\n\"It is negative stereotyping, not inside the Traveler community but outside it. If he had been from a different background, it would just have been: 'Oh, he's said something a bit daft.' But if Tyson says something even for a joke, it gets blown out of proportion.\"\n\nMaloney 'monster' accusation\n\nIn December, Fury was condemned by boxing promoter Kellie Maloney, who accused him of \"crossing the line\" and told CNN: \"Tyson has always been outspoken and said what he wants to say ... in a way he's become a bit of monster because now he's at the top of the pile.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Tyson Fury has 'become a monster' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tyson Fury has 'become a monster' 02:06\n\nJones admitted there were \"certain things\" that Fury \"would have been better off not saying,\" but added: \"All boxers want to be controversial. It gains publicity. But often what he says is twisted to be something unpleasant.\n\n\"He has never had any media training and then all of a sudden there are so many people following him around ... then he says things off the cuff and everything gets thrown back.\n\n\"You find that you would have been better off not talking to people. They create an image that sticks. It's a little bit like what has happened with [British Labour Party leader] Jeremy Corbyn.\"\n\nHahahaha u think you will get rid of the GYPSYKING that easy!!! I'm here to stay. #TheGreatest just shows u what the Medea are like. Tut tut \u2014 GYPSYKING, (@Tyson_Fury) 3 October 2016\n\nFury, who faces a UK Anti-Doping hearing in November after traces of a banned substance were allegedly found in a urine sample in June, this week tweeted his intention to retire from boxing.\n\nHowever, he retracted his claim almost immediately, writing: \"Hahahaha u think you will get rid of the GYPSYKING that easy!!!\"\n\nHe also posted a Photoshopped image of himself sitting behind piles of cocaine.\n\nBut he tweeted that he was \"getting the right help\" and vowed: \"I'll be back even stronger than before -- try and stop me!\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Maria Sharapova always knew her drugs ban would not be the way her tennis career would end.\n\nThe five-time grand slam champion will return to the sport in April 2017 after serving a 15-month suspension for testing positive for the banned substance meldonium at the Australian Open in January.\n\nSharapova was initially banned for two years by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) reduced the sanction by nine months, saying she bore \"no significant fault or negligence.\"\n\nThe panel concluded that while she did commit a doping violation, she was not an \"intentional doper.\"\n\n\"I knew this was never the way I going to finish my career and I was going to do it on my terms... I never doubted that,\" Sharapova told CNN.\n\nThe 29-year-old Russian added: \"I know who I am and I know how I've played the sport since I was a young girl, with integrity, I've never taken the easy way out, I'm one of the biggest fighters in the game.\n\n\"I love what I do and I will continue to keep doing it and forming with my legacy.\"\n\nSharapova said she was first prescribed the drug , also known as mildronate , in 2006 for heart issues and was unaware it had been added to the banned substance list by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as of January 1.\n\nAn independent panel appointed by the ITF ruled Sharapova hadn't used meldonium as a vehicle for cheating but stated the former world No. 1 was \"the sole author of her misfortune\" and handed out the two-year ban.\n\nJUST WATCHED A look back at Maria Sharapova's career Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A look back at Maria Sharapova's career 00:55\n\nHowever, Sharapova's legal team argued to CAS that she simply failed to read an email that stated meldonium would be added to the banned list. Her IMG agent Max Eisenbud also failed to check, it said.\n\nSharapova's lawyer, John Haggerty, called Tuesday's ruling a ''stunning repudiation'' of the ITF, which he said failed to properly notify players of the meldonium ban.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why would athletes use meldonium?

Maybe this has a bit of an element of Russia bashing. I don't think politics and sport should be mixed up,\" he said.\n\nWADA is yet to respond to CNN's request for comment on Eliasch's allegation.",

The results are both surprising (64 percent of millennials described themselves as more materialistic than their parents) and encouraging (roughly 50 percent of them voted in 2012). The conventional wisdom might be that millennials are self-involved and tech-addicted, but they're also much more liberal than even Gen X on all sorts of cultural issues. Broadly speaking, the kids are alright. But even the savviest millennial is likely clueless about the 50 people, cultural artifacts, pieces of technology, and other ephemera collected here. These things seemed important once.

    "text": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) Malaysia's population is made up predominantly of ethnic Malays, Chinese and Indians -- diverse cultures that each have unique cuisines.\n\nIt's no wonder the country is a food lover's paradise.\n\nStreet stalls, food courts and restaurants offer everything from barbecued skewers and grilled seafood to fried rice and piping hot bowls of noodles.\n\nThe capital, Kuala Lumpur, has some of the best fine dining establishments in Southeast Asia.\n\nBut just because something costs $2 doesn't mean it's not delicious.\n\nHere are the unmissable dishes in KL that offer a true taste of the local flavors -- and where to find them.\n\nChili pan mee at Restoran Super Kitchen\n\nThis authentically Chinese-Malaysian noodle dish is an explosion of textures and flavors that will leave you wanting a second -- or third serving.\n\nSoft, chewy noodles are topped with fried anchovy, deep fried onions, fresh scallions, crushed peanuts, shredded pork and a poached egg.\n\nDiners can add as much dry chili as they like and use chopsticks to mix it all together, breaking the egg yolk and making a sauce that coats the noodles with the spices, peanuts and onions.\n\nWhere: Restoran Super Kitchen, 33, Jalan Dewan Sultan Sulaiman 1, off Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman\n\nPrice: 7.50 Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) ($1.81) per bowl\n\nCurry laksa at Kam Fatt\n\nLaksa is a traditional Malaysian coconut noodle soup and nowhere does it better than Kam Fatt, an unassuming street side restaurant that's only open for breakfast and lunch.\n\nChoices include egg noodles, flat rice noodles, vermicelli or a combination of two or three.\n\nThe noodles are smothered in a thick gravy and served with boiled Hainan-style chicken, fried tofu puffs, cockles, bean sprouts and green beans.\n\nIt's seasoned with a squeeze of fresh lime and extra chili sauce.\n\nMouths will tingle from the perfect balance of sweet, savory and spicy.\n\nWhere: Restoran Kam Fatt, 37, Jalan Tengkat Tongshin\n\nPrice: MYR6 per bowl\n\nBanana leaf in Bangsar\n\nForget plates and utensils.\n\nThe authentic way to eat this traditional South Indian cuisine is with hands.\n\nA set meal consists of rice, a crispy papadum and a choice of curries and chutney that are served on a banana leaf.\n\nDiners can also choose to add chicken, beef, fish or vegetable curry and other dishes to round out their meal.\n\nThe meal is best ended with a banana or mango lassi, which is sweet and cooling and tempers down the heat of the spicy curry.\n\nWhere: Devis Corner, Nirvana or Raj's Banana Leaf -- all in Bangsar\n\nPrice: From MYR7.50\n\nMr. Chiam's pisang goreng (fried banana) stall\n\nSo worth it: Mr Chiam's deep fried bananas\n\nThis stall is only open for five hours a day -- but it's so popular that people will stand in line and risk getting heat stroke to get their hands on some deep fried bananas, root vegetables, sesame balls and curry puffs.\n\nEverything is made on order.\n\nThe bananas and root veggies are dipped in a batter right before your eyes and cooked in a giant vat of boiling oil.\n\nThat first bite into the fried banana makes it worth the wait.\n\nThe batter is sweet and crispy, the banana inside is soft and warm.\n\nThe sesame balls are also crunchy on the outside, doughy in the middle and have a warm peanut or green bean filling.\n\nThe curry puffs are said to be the best in town -- with a flaky crust and spicy potato filling.\n\nWhere: Mr. Chiam's Pisang Goreng Stall, Brickfields opposite the YMCA\n\nPrice: MYR1.30 per piece of fried banana, root vegetable or sesame ball, MRY1.50 per curry puff\n\nChar kuey teow at Rocky\n\nSmokey sensation: Rocky Restaurant's char kuey teow\n\nWhile most westerners are probably more familiar with Hong Kong-style beef fried noodles, Malaysia's version, called char kuey teow, is much more complex but every bit is as delicious.\n\nFlat rice noodles are tossed in a wok with egg, prawns, fish cake slices, chicken or pork and a combination of dark and light soy sauce, shrimp paste and just a bit of chili.\n\nThe key to a good char kuey teow is the smokey flavor that's infused in the noodles.\n\nMrs. Cheong, who runs the stand at Rocky Restaurant, has mastered the skill of heating the wok to just the right temperature to seal in that smokiness.\n\nWhere: Rocky Restaurant, 15, Jalan Telawi 5, Bangsar\n\nPrice: MYR5.50 per plate\n\nRoti canai at Raju Restaurant\n\nOn weekends this long established South Indian restaurant can be found packed with people who've just finished a hike through Bukit Gasing Forest Park and want to reward themselves with a hearty roti breakfast.\n\nThe fresh made bread is warm and crispy on the outside, with soft, chewy layers inside.\n\nIt can be torn apart with hands and dipped in a choice of vegetable, chicken or fish curry.\n\nWhere: Raju Restaurant, 27, Jalan Chantek 5/13, Bukit Gasing, Petaling Jaya\n\nPrice: MYR1.50 per roti\n\nSun Fong's bah kut teh\n\nThis 45-year-old establishment specializes in bah kut teh, a pork bone soup that's slow cooked in a clay pot with Chinese medicinal herbs.\n\nThe place is popular among locals and celebrities from around Asia -- photos of them taken with the owner are plastered on the walls.\n\nOne taste of the signature soup reveals why they came.\n\nThe flavor is rich and savory with a kick of sweetness that hits at the very end.\n\nMalaysian bah kut teh is not to be confused with its Singaporean counterpart, which is cooked with garlic and pepper rather than Chinese herbs.\n\nThough they share a name, the two variations could not be more different.\n\nWhere: 37, Medan Imbi, Pudu\n\nPrice: MYR17 for an individual serving\n\nSin Kee's signature braised rice\n\nChinese restaurant Sin Kee is an institution in KL's predominately Indian neighborhood of Brickfields.\n\nIts signature dish is braised rice.\n\nIt's hard to know what to expect at first because it's served as a plastic bowl turned upside down on a plastic plate.\n\nSlowly lifting the bowl and exposes a medley of meat, seafood and vegetables slow cooked in a sweet sauce that smothers the rice below.\n\nThe traditional serving includes pork, sausage, fish cake slices, lettuce, squid, onions and a fried egg, but Sin Kee also does a non-pork version.\n\nWhere: Restoran Sin Kee, 194, Jalan Tun Sambanthan, Brickfields\n\nPrice: MYR9.50 per bowl\n\nNasi lemak at Nasi Lemak Famous\n\nNasi Lemak literally translates into \"fatty rice.\"\n\nIt's rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf. In Malaysia it's the breakfast -- or midnight snack -- of champions.\n\nThe dish is often served with a piece of fried chicken, a fried or boiled egg, a side of sliced cucumber, dried anchovy, fried soy beans and a spoonful of spicy sambal sauce.\n\nIt's a delicious combination of sweet, salty and spicy, soft, chewy and crunchy.\n\nLocals flock to Nasi Lemak Famous in Bangsar-- which has the reputation of being the best in town.\n\nWhere: Nasi Lemak Famous, Bangsar Selera Food Court, Jalan Telawi 1, Bangsar\n\nPrice: MYR7 per basic plate of rice, chicken and fried egg\n\nKam Lian Kee's famous Hokkien noodles\n\nMany Chinese-Malaysians can trace their ancestry back to Fujian province in China.\n\nHokkien is how Fujian is pronounced in the local dialect.\n\nHokkien fried noodles are thick egg noodles, stir-fried with pork, prawns, squid, cabbage and very small bits of crispy pork skin in the dark sweet soy sauce that has become synonymous with Southeast Asian Chinese cuisine.\n\nIt acts as camouflage for the other ingredients so there's a surprise with every bite.\n\nWhere: Kam Lian Kee, 56, Jalan Petaling, City Centre\n\nPrice: MYR9 per plate\n\nNgau Kee Beef Noodle Stand\n\nPost-rave fave: Ngau Kee beef noodles\n\nThis family business has been running for more than 40 years.\n\nTucked away in an alleyway in Bukit Bintang, it's a popular spot for people to eat at after a night of clubbing but it opens at 6 p.m. for anyone wanting an early dinner.\n\nCustomers get a choice of egg noodles, broad rice noodles or silver needle noodles, which are topped with minced beef that's slow cooked in a dark soy sauce.\n\nIt's topped with fresh cut scallions and dry chili and mixed well before eating.\n\nIt's served with a side of soup with beef balls, chuck and tripe that can be dipped in homemade chili sauce.\n\nWhere: Tengkat Tong Shin, Bukit Bintang\n\nPrice: MYR7 for small serving\n\nNitro coffee at Bean Reserve\n\nNot traditionally Malaysian, but definitely a treat to escape the heat in KL -- Bean Reserve specializes in cold coffee that's chilled by nitrogen and poured out of a beer tap, bearing a texture similar to Guinness.\n\nOwner Jeremy Chan also recently introduced \"nitro white\" to the menu -- the milk coffee has a striking resemblance to Bailey's Irish Cream.\n\nThose not into coffee can try the specially brewed nitro tea, which is infused with lemongrass.\n\nBean Reserve is also known for its soft serve ice cream, which tastes just like the milk left in the bowl after you've finished your sugar-laced cereal.\n\nWhere: Bean Reserve Coffee Roasters, 8, Lengkok Abdullah, Bangsar\n\nPrice: From MYR8 for drinks, MYR8 for soft serve\n\nBeggar's chicken at New Heong Kee\n\nNew Heong Kee Restaurant has been around for decades, but its location is conspicuous -- hidden along a highway next to the national zoo.\n\nA lot of locals don't even know about it.\n\nIt specializes in beggar's chicken -- a dish that has its roots in China's Jiangsu province.\n\nA fresh chicken is marinated in Chinese medicinal herbs and Shaoxing cooking wine, then encased in clay and buried in a kiln and slowly roasted for six hours.\n\nWhen it's served, the succulent meat simply falls off the bone and melts in the mouth -- having absorbed all the juices and flavors.\n\nOther star attractions are the double boiled winter melon soup and the country-style fish -- meat is deboned from a mackerel, then turned into a paste and stuffed back into the fish so it looks like it was never deconstructed to begin with.\n\nIt's both skillful and delicious.\n\nWhere: New Heong Kee Restaurant, 446, Batu 7 1/2, Jalan Ulu Klang\n\nPrice: MYR48 per chicken\n\nNasi padang at Restoran Minang Salero\n\nMinang Salero is one of Kuala Lumpur's hidden gems if you're a fan of Indonesian-style nasi padang.\n\nThis place, tucked away in the unassuming (but rapidly gentrifying) inner city suburb of Sentul, features a veritable smorgasbord of Malay and Indonesian staples.\n\nBut the piece de resistance is the beef rendang -- a delicious curry made of coconut, chilli and spice.\n\nUnlike most places, the beef in Minang Salero's rendang is rather chewy, which adds fantastic texture to the dish.\n\nIt's best eaten with chili potato chips and sambal oelek (a spicy chilli sauce) on a steaming pile of rice.\n\nWhere: No 1088, Sentul Pasar, Kuala Lumpur\n\nPrice: About MYR8 per plate, price varies depending on combination of dishes\n\nClaypot butter crabs at Restoran Wong Poh\n\nWong Poh has everything you'd expect from a Malaysian Chinese restaurant -- the usual noodle and rice dishes, the assortment of pork staples as well as the expected range of riches from the sea.\n\nWhat truly stands out though is its claypot butter crabs.\n\nWhile the best known crab dish from the Southeast Asian region is Singapore's chili crab, Wong Poh's method of cooking the crustacean is an underrated joy.\n\nSlathered in a buttery sauce, the dish comes with an added dose of savory flavor thanks to the liberal amounts of curry leaves added to it.\n\nA plate of man tou (fried buns) is a great way to mop up whatever sauce remains.\n\nWhere: 36 & 38, Jalan Bukit Mayang 1/2, Bukit Mayang Mas, Petaling Jaya\n\nPrice: MYR28 per crab\n\nPalm sugar appam at Om Shakti Chelo's Appam Stall Bangsar\n\nRestoran Minang Salero, in the inner city suburb of Sentul.\n\nAppam is a traditional Indian breakfast pancake made from fermented rice batter.\n\nIt's soft in the middle, crispy around the edges and usually served with a hefty

    "text": "Glasgow, Scotland (CNN) Some people find their salvation in religion. But Scotsman Davie Duke found his on the soccer field.\n\nIn 2001, the death of his father sent him into a downward spiral. Duke struggled with alcohol and depression. By 22, he was homeless.\n\n\"I always remember just feeling so alone,\" he said.\n\nAt a shelter, he saw a recruiting poster for the Homeless World Cup, a soccer tournament for homeless people. Duke made the team, and while the 2004 tournament was a thrill, he realized that the training for it had been the real catalyst for changing his life.\n\n\"The structure of training, the camaraderie with my teammates, having positive role models -- it all got me back into a positive place,\" said Duke, now 36.\n\nIn 2009, he started Street Soccer Scotland to share what he'd learned with others.\n\nEvery week, his organization provides free soccer clinics to more than 1,000 people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Participants may be struggling with homelessness or addiction; some are refugees experiencing social isolation.\n\n\"When you're homeless or on the edge of society, often you don't feel part of anything,\" Duke said. \"But football gives you a place where you belong ... and that's when change happens.\"\n\nDuke also partners with organizations that offer assistance with housing, addiction and mental health. But at its heart, Street Soccer is about giving people a chance to connect with others and move themselves beyond difficult times.\n\n\"We tell them 'It's not about what's happened yesterday. It's about what you do tomorrow' \" Duke said. \"That's the best inspiration for anyone.\"\n\nCNN spoke with Duke about his work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.\n\nCNN: The Homeless World Cup played a pivotal role in your life. What was that like?\n\nDuke: At that time, it was only in its second year. A street paper for homeless people was assembling a football squad to represent Scotland. It took quite a lot of courage for me to go to the tryouts because I had no self-esteem and was feeling so low.\n\nFor three months, we trained twice a week. It gave me structure, friendships, confidence. It gave me something to look forward to -- a wee bit of hope. It got me my life back.\n\nAfter the tournament, I started coaching kids' football and decided to go to college. I trained as a community support worker and got a job working with people who were on the streets. I was the assistant coach for the Scotland Homeless World Cup team for a couple of years and was the head coach in 2007, the first time Scotland won the tournament.\n\nBut I realized, while the (event) is great for the players who go to represent their country, in Scotland, there are 36,000 homeless people. So I quit my job and set up Street Soccer to create something that's year-round. And we use the Homeless World Cup as this kind of celebration once a year.\n\nJust last month, we held the 14th Homeless World Cup here in Glasgow. It's the most inspiring football tournament in the world.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Davie Duke delivers hope through soccer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Davie Duke delivers hope through soccer 02:27\n\nCNN: Your program is about more than playing football.\n\nDuke: We see ourselves as football for everyone -- a place where you belong. Once players build up confidence at our weekly drop-in football sessions, they often say, \"What else can I do?\" So we run education courses in communications, writing skills or working with others.\n\nPlayers who have been engaged for a few months can volunteer with our youth program in areas affected by poverty. All pass background checks and receive additional training. It's a unique solution because, on one hand you've got kids whose parents maybe can't afford to send them to a local football club, and on the other, our players are getting a chance to give back and gain skills. So it's a win-win.\n\nCNN: How successful is your program?\n\nDuke: Over 80% make some sort of positive impact in their life, whether that's getting a job, maintaining a house, addressing addiction or improving mental health.\n\nBut Street Soccer's not a magic wand. You just don't wave it and people suddenly change their lives. There's a lot of effort and a lot of hard work that goes in from the players and a lot of support from the staff, coaches and volunteers. But if we all help one person each time, then that's a lot of people.\n\nCNN: Your personal story is powerful evidence that football can change lives. How has that carried over to your work?\n\nDuke: When I started, I was the homeless person who'd changed his life. But now, most of our staff has come through the program -- through addiction or homelessness. So players can see someone who has walked in their shoes. They can see a way out. It emphasizes the idea that, 'Maybe I can change.' And that's all we're about.",

    "text": "(CNN) There's no shortage of cool new planes to get excited about in 2016: the narrow-body Bombardier CS100, the next-generation Airbus A350 XWB and the low-riding Boeing 737 MAX.\n\nBut there's nothing like the nostalgic thrill of getting close to some of aviation's greatest pioneers, from the Bleriot XI that took Louis Bleriot over the English channel in 1909, to the de Havilland Dragon Rapide that carried both General Francisco Franco and Charles de Gaulle on history-changing operations, to the Tupolev Tu-134s that were the workhorses of the Soviet bloc.\n\nSurprisingly, many of history's most iconic models of plane are still airworthy and even available to fly.\n\nHere are 20 of our favorites and tips on where you might be able to snag a seat.\n\nAnd if you like these, you can also take a look at our guide to groundbreaking planes of the modern era\n\nBleriot XI\n\nFrenchman Edmond Salis flies a restored Bleriot XI in July 2009 to mark the 100th anniversary of Louis Bleriot's historic crossing.\n\nFirst flight: 1909\n\nIn 1909 French aviation pioneer Louis Bleriot completed the first successful crossing of the English Channel by air.\n\nThis historic feat earned him a prize of \u00a31,000 ($144,000 in today's money). The monoplane he used for the crossing was a Bleriot XI. Amazingly, a few of these aircraft are still airworthy.\n\nGranted, given the rarity and fragility of the type, the chances of getting to fly it are next to nil, but it would still be theoretically possible to enjoy the \"Bleriot experience.\"\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nTwo of them, built in 1909, are still airworthy, preserved in museums in the UK -- the Shuttleworth Collection -- and the U.S. (the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome ).\n\nThese are the oldest flyable aircraft in the world, although due to their fragility they are only flown over short distances on very special occasions.\n\nA Bleriot XI built under license in Sweden in 1918 is also preserved by the Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm and has made occasional appearances at a local air festival.\n\nAn exact replica of the Bleriot XI is found at the Canadian Aviation Heritage Centre in Montreal, also in flying condition. Its last outing was in 2014.\n\nThe Shuttleworth Collection, Old Warden Aerodrome, Biggleswade SG18 9EP England;\n\nOld Rhinebeck Aerodrome, Stone Church Rd, Rhinebeck, NY 12572;\n\nJunkers F13\n\nFirst flight: 1919\n\nGerman aviation entrepreneur Hugo Junkers came up with an aircraft that was truly ahead of its time.\n\nThe F13 was the first all-metal aircraft. Its clean simple lines and cantilever-wing monoplane design anticipate the modern airliner.\n\nThis is even more remarkable when we take into account that in the year it first flew, 1919, most aircraft were little more than primitive contraptions made of wood and cloth. The F13, in contrast, even had a closed heated cabin.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nIt will soon be possible to fly again on the F13.\n\nIt won't be an original airframe, but an exact replica, built by German luggage manufacturer RIMOWA.\n\nThe RIMOWA F13 is based at Dubendorf airfield, Switzerland, and it will soon be accepting reservations.\n\nJunkers Ju 52\n\nFirst flight: 1930\n\nAnother product of the Junkers workshop, the German aircraft nicknamed Tante Ju (Auntie Ju) started life in the early '30s as a civilian airliner.\n\nIt also saw extensive military service as a transport aircraft with the Luftwaffe during World War II and with multiple air forces and airlines until long after the war was over.\n\nIt's easily recognizable because of its characteristic tri-motor configuration and corrugated metal skin.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nTo this day, German airline Lufthansa keeps an airworthy Ju 52 in its fleet that can be chartered for special occasions.\n\nJu-Air of Switzerland, based at Dubendorf (the same airfield where the Junkers F13 replica is also based), operates Ju 52s for pleasure flights\n\nOther surviving and airworthy Ju 52s are found in South Africa, France and the United States.\n\nDe Havilland Dragon Rapide\n\nVisit England if you want to fly on a De Havilland Dragon Rapide.\n\nFirst flight: 1934\n\nThis wooden biplane airliner had a key role in two events that changed European history.\n\nIn 1936, a Dragon Rapide flew General Francisco Franco from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco, at the start of the military rebellion that ignited the Spanish Civil War.\n\nFour years later, it was also a Dragon Rapide that evacuated General Charles De Gaulle to England just before the fall of France.\n\nBut aside from these momentous appearances, the Dragon Rapide proved to be a very reliable aircraft.\n\nIt was in service with quite a few airlines before and after World War II. It even had a starring role in the 2011 British Airways TV commercial \"To Fly. To Serve.\"\n\nSeveral Dragon Rapides are still airworthy with private operators offering pleasure flights.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nClassic Wings , based at Imperial War Museum, Duxford (UK).\n\nA Dragon Rapide G-AHAG in the livery of Scillonia Airways is airworthy and based at Membury airfield, Berkshire (UK).\n\nDouglas DC-3\n\nDouglas DC-3: An aircraft that has lasted through the decades.\n\nFirst flight: 1934\n\nThis is, without doubt, one of the most important aircraft in the history of aviation.\n\nSome may even call it the first truly modern airliner.\n\nIt first flew in 1935, soon entering service with several U.S. airlines and enabling coast-to-coast passenger flights. Over 600 had been built when the United States entered the war and it was swiftly converted into a military transport under the designation C-47.\n\nThousands were built during World War II where it was the workhorse of the Allied armies in all theaters of the war.\n\nA version was produced in the Soviet Union, named the Lisunov Li-2.\n\nAfter the war the DC-3 became the mainstay of many airlines.\n\nAs proof of its durability and efficiency, more than 80 years after its first flight many different DC-3 aircraft are still flying around the world, and it's still possible to book flights on them.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nDDA Classic Airlines , of the Netherlands, operates a DC-3 in classic KLM livery, available for bookings on scheduled days and upon request.\n\nAlexander van Houtert, a manager at DDA, explains how this particular aircraft has a long and distinguished history.\n\nDuring World War II, it was active over Normandy on D-Day and later during Operation Market Garden.\n\nAfter the war, it used to fly the Dutch royal family around.\n\n\"It used to be the Dutch Air Force One back in those days!\" says van Houtert.\n\nAir Chathams , of New Zealand, charters a DC-3 for scenic flights and also operates some scheduled passenger services between Auckland and Whakatane.\n\nBuffalo Airways operates scheduled DC-3 services out of Yellowknife, in Canada's Northwest Territories. The airline was also featured in an episode of the reality TV show \"Ice Pilots.\"\n\nSpringbok Classic Air of South Africa operates scenic flights through Africa.\n\nLockheed Constellation and Super Constellation\n\nThe Super Constellation was known for its distinctive triple tail.\n\nFirst flight: 1943\n\nThe majestic, elegant lines of the Lockheed Constellation, and its more advanced derivative, the L-1049 Super Constellation (known respectively as \"Connie\" and \"Super Connie\"), were a sight to behold.\n\nIts characteristic triple tail was a common sight at airports in the post-war years and until the mid-1960s.\n\nIt was also the last of its kind. These older aircraft could not compete with the new jet airliners, such as the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, that replaced them on long-haul routes.\n\nA handful of Super Connies remained in service in multiple civilian and military roles, some as late as the 1990s.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nThere are two Super Constellations still flying, one of them with the Swiss watch manufacturer Breitling together with the Super Constellation Flying Association, the other one with the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society of Australia. Both surviving aircraft make regular appearances on the airshow circuit.\n\nConvair CV-580\n\nFirst flight (of the CV-240): 1947\n\nConvair produced a whole family of airliners, starting with the CV-240, with the aim of replacing the popular DC-3 with a more advanced design featuring a pressurized cabin.\n\nOver a thousand were built between 1947 and 1954 and entered service with a large number of airlines and air forces.\n\nDuane Emeny, airline and charter general manager of Air Chathams, the only airline that still operates the type, highlights the reliability of the 580 variant: \"The Convair 580 was truly ahead of its time, and it comes with an exceptional level of system redundancy.\n\n\"It is very robust and able to operate effectively in all sort of climates. It has enabled us to fly direct to Auckland and to bring to market the Chatham Islands' main export: rock lobster.\"\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nAir Chathams , of New Zealand, has three of them still flying and available for booking.\n\nBoeing 707\n\nA Boeing 707 -- used by U.S. Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon and George Bush -- is housed in Air Force One Pavilion at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.\n\nFirst flight: 1957\n\nThe first modern long-haul jet: The world became a whole lot smaller once the Boeing 707 entered service in 1958.\n\nThe Boeing 707 was not only much faster than propeller aircraft, but it set standards for passenger comfort and aircraft design that, with some improvements, are still at the basis of today's air travel experience.\n\nThe Boeing 707 was instrumental in popularizing air travel.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nSince 2011, there have not been any commercial airline services on Boeing 707s.\n\nOne option might be to get yourself invited on board one of the handful of VIP-configured Boeing 707s still operated by a handful of governments, or to befriend John Travolta, as the actor keeps one for personal use.\n\nHey, we never said it would be easy.\n\nDouglas DC-8\n\nFirst flight: 1958\n\nA contemporary and rival of the Boeing 707, the DC-8 was also instrumental in the transition from propellers to jets.\n\nIt was the first airliner ever to break the sound barrier, although it was only for 16 seconds during a test flight.\n\nIt proved to be a popular airliner that remained in service for decades with many airlines and governments.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nTo be honest, chances are close to nil for the general public.\n\nHowever, a handful of DC-8s are still operational as freighters and, most remarkably, NASA keeps one for use as a flying laboratory.\n\nAntonov An-24\n\nFirst flight: 1959\n\nWhat it lacks in glamor, the An-24 makes up for in robustness and reliability, which made it an ideal aircraft to use throughout the vast expanses of the Soviet Union.\n\nDesigned in the 1950s, it continues in service to this day with civilian and military operators, particularly in areas with little ground infrastructure.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nAlthough most An-24s currently in service are either freighters or military transport, Ukrainian carrier Motor Sich Airlines still operates them on regular passenger flights.\n\nBoeing 727\n\nYou can brave a zero gravity flight on a converted Boeing 727.\n\nFirst flight: 1963\n\nWhat the Boeing 707 and DC-8 did for long-haul routes, the Boeing 727 did for short- and medium-haul ones.\n\nThis reliable three-engine airliner with capacity for some 150 passengers became a real workhorse of the airline industry.\n\nAs it entered service with a large number of airlines around the world, it replaced a myriad of propeller aircraft types.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nUnless you are in the military of Bolivia, Mongolia or the few other countries that still have it in government service, your best chance of flying the Boeing 727 is to head to Iran, where the last of the type are operated by Iran Aseman Airlines\n\nFor a more unconventional Boeing 727 experience you can also book a zero gravity flight\n\nTupolev Tu-134\n\nFirst flight: 1963\n\nBy the second half of the 1960s, the Tu-134 was the workhorse of Soviet civilian aviation.\n\nMore than 800 of them entered service with Aeroflot and other airlines and air forces of the Communist bloc.\n\nThe signature features of the Tu-134 are its glass nose and sweptback wing, both a legacy of the Tupolev Tu-16 bomber, from which the airliner derives.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nThose wanting to fly on the Tu-134 had better hurry up since only a handful of them remain in commercial service.\n\nCurrent operators include Air Koryo , the North Korean flag carrier (there are agencies that organize aviation tours of North Korea) and Russian airlines Alrosa and Kosmos Airlines.\n\nThe latter operates charter flights between Moscow and the Baikonur cosmodrome , in Kazakhstan, that can be booked as part of a special tour.\n\nIlyushin Il-62\n\nFirst flight: 1963\n\nThe Il-62 was the Soviet answer to the Boeing 707 and DC-8. It was the main long-haul airliner of the former Communist bloc, in service with Aeroflot and the East German carrier Interflug among others.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nThere are still a few in government service in Russia, but your last chance to fly it on a commercial flight is, again, with Air Koryo.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas DC-9 and MD-80/90 series\n\nFirst flight: 1965\n\nThis was a widely successful aircraft, recognizable by its twin-engines located at the rear of the aircraft, next to the tail.\n\nThe relatively small DC-9 opened up many \"thin\" routes for jet service -- the industry name for services with lower passenger demand.\n\nIt later evolved into the MD-80/90 series, for many years the third player in the market for medium-sized aircraft, competing with the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320.\n\nBoeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997 and production of the MD-80 series was discontinued.\n\nSome might argue that the DC-9 still lives on in the form of the Boeing 717, as the youngest and smallest of the MD-80/90 family was renamed after the Boeing acquisition.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nFor a double thrill, another way to enjoy the DC-9 is to skydive from it. Perris Valley Skydiving , based in California, still keeps one in its fleet.\n\nEmbraer EMB 110 Bandeirante\n\nFirst flight: 1968\n\nBrazil's first foray into aircraft manufacturing: It was an experience that proved to be so successful that, five decades later, Embraer has consolidated its position in the select aircraft-making elite, focusing on the regional and executive jet segment.\n\nBack in 1985, the Bandeirante became the first aircraft operated by a then small and little-known Irish airline called Ryanair.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nOne of the perks of tracking down a Bandeirante today is that to fly one you'll have to travel to such inspiring locations as the Cook Islands or the Bahamas, where it is still in operation with the tropically named Pineapple Air\n\nAirbus A300\n\nAir France was the launch customer of the Airbus A300.\n\nFirst flight: 1972\n\nThis was the first aircraft designed and produced by Airbus.\n\nIts launch marked a momentous event for the European commercial aviation industry, which was finally able to compete head on with the large American manufacturers.\n\nIn fact, the European consortium has, since then, grown and evolved to become one of the two major players in the global aircraft manufacturing industry.\n\nThe A300 also represented a novel concept at the time: the twin-engine wide-body airliner, particularly useful for high-density short- and medium-haul routes.\n\nFive of them, named A300-600ST, were heavily modified by Airbus to carry aircraft sections and other components between the group's factories.\n\nThey are known as Belugas because of their whale-like shape.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nAlthough most of the A300s in service are freighters, you can still fly the type commercially with Kuwait Airways and Mahan Air of Iran.\n\nTupolev Tu-154\n\nFirst flight: 1968\n\nIt is recognizable by its three engines at the back, in an arrangement similar to that of its Western contemporary, the Boeing 727.\n\nThe elegant shape of the Tu-154 can be misleading, though, since it's a durable, robust aircraft that has been used in all sorts of runway and landing conditions.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nMore than a thousand Tu-154s were built, but if you're an aviation aficionado looking to fly on one of them, your options are running out fast. Most airlines have been actively phasing them out in recent years.\n\nIn addition to North Korea's Air Koryo, airlines Alrosa of Russia and Belavia of Belarus still have the type in their fleets.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas DC-10/MD-11\n\nCharity Orbis International's Flying Eye Hospital is operated on a DC-10.\n\nFirst flight: 1970\n\nThis was Douglas' answer to the Jumbo Jet. Easily recognizable because of its three-engines configuration, one below the tail, the other two in under-wing pods. It first flew in 1970 and was followed later the MD-10 and MD-11, heavily modernized successors.\n\nWhere can you fly it?\n\nIt has got a lot harder to get to fly on them since Biman, of Bangladesh operated the last DC-10 passenger flight in 2014 and KLM did the same with its last MD-11 in 2015.\n\nThere are a few freighters left, but, undoubtedly, the most remarkable surviving DC-10 was the Flying Eye Hospital, operated by charity Orbis International, as a base to provide ophthalmological services to those in need all over the world.\n\nAt the time of writing, however, Orbis International was in the process of replacing its DC-10 with a more modern MD-10 -- still part of the same family of aircraft -- donated by FedEx.\n\nFokker 50\n\nFirst flight: 1985\n\nOnce upon a time not so long ago the Netherlands was a major player in the aircraft-making industry.\n\nThe Fokker 50, a propeller airliner designed for regional flights, was one of the most popular products of historical Dutch firm Fokker, which traced its roots back to the very early days of aviation.\n\nWhere you can fly it?",

Also, text highlights and a transcript of the discussion are below.\n\nMANDATORY CREDIT: CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\n\nContacts: Lauren Pratapas \u2014 Lauren.Pratapas@turner.com; 202.465.6666; Brooke Lorenz- Brooke.Lorenz@turner.com\n\n\n\nTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\n\nJohnson on delegate uprising \u201canything can happen\u201d: [BASH] And joining me now is Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. First question, senator, is do you support the idea that convention delegates should be able to vote their conscience, be unbound if they are currently bound to vote for Donald trump? [JOHNSON] Well, good morning, Dana. I'm not a delegate. I really do not know. Nobody can really predict what's going to be the outcome of our nomination process. I know there's a number of movements afoot. I'm not part of that process. I have my own race here in Wisconsin. I\u2019m going to concentrate on the areas of agreement, growing our economy, strengthening our military, defeating ISIS, securing our borders, making sure that we have judges appointed to the Supreme Court. So those are the issues, you know, economic growth so that we have - create better opportunities for the American public for the folks here in Wisconsin. I mean, that\u2019s the think I\u2019m going to concentrate on.\n\nJohnson on if he will support Donald Trump: [BASH] According to a paper from your home state you said just before an event last month \"I\u2019m going to certainly endorse the Republican nominee and obviously it looks like that will be Mr. Trump.\" Have you endorsed him? [JOHNSON] It has been my intention to support the Republican nominee. And again nobody can predict the outcome of this thing. So I think things remain reasonably uncertain. But is my intention to support \u2013 [BASH] So are you endorsing Mr. Trump right now? [JOHNSON] I intend to support the Republican nominee and certainly support the areas of agreement, growing our economy, defeating ISIS, strengthening our military, securing our border. I mean, those - no two people agree 100 percent on everything. So I'll support the areas of agreement? [BASH] Support but not endorse, what's the difference? [JOHNSON] Well to me endorsement is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything. That's not necessarily be the case with our nominee, so I\u2019ll certainly be an independent voice where I disagree with a particular nominee. I'll voice it, whether it's Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or anybody else. I'll voice those disagreements and I\u2019ll certainly support the areas of agreement.\n\nJohnson on Facebook\u2019s cooperation on terror investigations : [BASH] And senator, three days after the Orlando shootings last week you wrote a letter to Facebook to CEO Mark Zuckerberg - Zuckerberg, forgive me - and you asked the company to turn over material relating to the accounts linked to the Orlando shooter because he was posting on that site during the attack. Has Mark Zuckerberg or anybody from Facebook responded? [JOHNSON] Yes. I\u2019m sure Facebook is going to be cooperative. They've been cooperative in the past. They've been doing very innovative - taking very innovative efforts trying to counter ISIS' vile and barbaric use of social media. So I view Facebook as a real partner in this.\n\n\n\nFULL POST",

    "text": "Christi Paul is anchor of CNN's \"New Day Weekend.\" She is passionate about sharing her story to help and inspire the lives of other women. Join her this October and lend your voice to Domestic Violence Awareness Month. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\n(CNN) Being belittled. Being shoved. Being threatened. This isn't bullying at school or work -- it's abuse at home. It's the ugly, violent truth hidden behind closed doors across America. It's the smile you fake as you leave the house, wishing you could get in a car or a bus and take it all the way to a new life.\n\nI was there at one point in time, so I get it. And when I finally walked out the door, I had hope. It was buried beneath fear, anger and confusion, but it was there.\n\nBefore you enter into an abusive relationship, you think you're one kind of person, but after, you often wonder who you really are. How did you allow this in your life? Why didn't you leave sooner? Why didn't you fight back?\n\nThese answers will vary from person to person, but behind the tears and the turmoil, there is freedom. When you finally determine to leave, you experience the kind of freedom that lights up your soul and sparks a die-hard determination to fight for it every time it's endangered. In other words, there IS life on the other side of pain.\n\nHere are three of the best things I learned from my worst relationship that serve me so well now.\n\n1. Our purpose isn't diluted when we're alone.\n\nOf all the things I thought I was, there was something I didn't know about myself until after that relationship -- I was relationship-dependent.\n\nI was perfectly comfortable having my own job, hobbies and friends. But at the end of the day, I craved being part of a pair. I found security in the knowledge that I had a significant other, even if he wasn't next to me all the time.\n\nThat co-dependency was a wicked need waiting to pounce in moments of vulnerability. But after four years of a relationship that brought me to my knees, praying for a way out countless times before I was actually willing to TAKE that way out, I realized the bliss of breathing my own air, of choosing my own way and of inhaling the simplicity of waking in the morning to a quiet peace.\n\nI realized I'd rather be alone than be with the wrong person. Not only am I then available when the right person comes along, but I am free to pursue my passions and to do so on my own terms.\n\nYou see, when you're with someone who holds you down, who hurts you emotionally, physically or psychologically, your desires, talents and intentions cannot blossom. And over time you lose your sense of purpose.\n\nBut the truth is you don't need a significant other to give you purpose. Your value is wholly intact, independent of a partner who may or may not validate you.\n\n2. We have to set boundaries.\n\nI was really bad at this. I am a people pleaser. I want everyone to get along. I want to avoid conflict. I gave more credence to someone else's opinion than my own. Sound familiar?\n\nBut here's something I've learned; normal people don't try to destroy each other. How someone treats you is a reflection of him or her more often than of you. You have a responsibility to yourself to set boundaries with people who aren't good for you. And you know who they are -- the ones who are easily enraged, who constantly make jokes at your expense, who compete with you on an unhealthy level.\n\nJUST WATCHED VP Biden on Domestic Violence Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH VP Biden on Domestic Violence 01:02\n\nI'm not saying those people are bad. We're all wired differently and we all carry our own experiences with us. But are those people good for you? What do they bring to your life? You have a right to build that boundary and protect your space. Surround yourself with people who respect, support and celebrate you.\n\n3. Forgiveness is not easy, but it is necessary.\n\nI didn't fully, deeply feel freedom until I forgave him. And this lesson has come in handy, by the way, with other relationships since him.\n\nWhile I relished my new independence, that searing emotional pain didn't dissolve simply because I changed my address. But holding onto anger didn't protect me from future heartache either.\n\nExperiences make you wiser. Resentment makes you decay. Bitterness will break you if you don't find a way to break it. And quite frankly, that animosity you hold onto continues to give power to the person who hurt you. Why should you keep letting the past take swipes at you in the present?\n\nKnow this about forgiveness; you can forgive someone and still cut them out of your life.\n\nForgiving them doesn't make them suddenly safe for you, but it does give you the space to be genuinely free.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThat said, even years later, I still have days when I'm overwhelmed or frustrated or scared. I, like you, am human & beautifully imperfect. And you know what? I know he is too, and I truly wish him well. I want him to be happy and whole. There's good in him.\n\nThere's good in everyone. There's good in you. But recognize that not everyone is good FOR you.\n\nSo if you find yourself relating to all this, please know you can wave goodbye to your abuser and love him or her from afar. Get comfortable with being alone. And when you look back at the relationship you thought would break you, recognize you're still standing. Because you will be.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\nHow are you? It must be so exhausting running for President. I hope you're taking good care of yourself.\n\nI happened to be flipping through the channels on Thursday night when I saw you talking to Donald Trump at the Republican debate about what you called \"New York values.\" I wasn't sure at first what you meant, but then you explained: \"I think most people know exactly what New York values are: socially liberal, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, focused on money and the media.\"\n\nFor a moment I actually thought Mr. Trump was speechless, but duh, he's a New Yorker like me, and nobody cherishes the First Amendment more than us!\n\nAnyway, it's a new day.\n\nAnd I just took a car service home from my fiance's apartment on the Upper East Side. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with the UES. It's in Manhattan on the opposite side of Central Park where you had that fundraiser at those two gay guys' apartment in April? I hope that while you were here, you and your wife had time to visit the Goldman Sachs' headquarters to thank them for that big loan they gave you.\n\nJudy Gold\n\nI bet you saw the building as your plane was landing; it's one of those huge towers downtown by ground zero. Maybe you didn't have enough time, since you never know how the traffic is going to be on the George Washington Bridge when you're driving in from the airport.\n\nI live on the Upper West Side and my girlfriend and I are planning to get married as soon as we can find a big enough apartment to comfortably fit all four of us (two kids included). Both our apartments are rent stabilized, so we're taking our time finding the right place. If you're not familiar with the rent laws in New York, you should check them out.\n\nn 1997 , our Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, extended rent regulation laws after a big to-do with Republican State Sen. Joseph L. Bruno, who wanted them eliminated. Thank goodness, our mayor had two important allies: Republican State Sens.

It is the sixth GOP debate of this election cycle and the first of 2016. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Trump, who has been leading GOP polls for months, answers a question during the debate. \"I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly, and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger,\" he said. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Cruz speaks during the debate. The senator from Texas opened the event by talking about the U.S. sailors recently detained by Iran. \"Today,\" he said, \"many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads. ... I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.\" Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Bush waves to the audience. The former Florida governor has been trying to build momentum that he had in the early stages of his candidacy, and he went after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton early in the debate. \"She's under investigation with the FBI right now,\" he said. \"If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that.\" Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Rubio delivers an answer during the debate. He frequently attacked President Barack Obama. \"When I become president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders,\" the senator from Florida said. \"When I'm president of the United States, we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.\" Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Carson promised this week he would \"insinuate\" himself into the conversation when needed. After a discussion between Rubio and Christie during the debate, Carson told moderator Neil Cavuto, \"Neil I was mentioned too.\" Cavuto asked, \"You were?\" Carson quipped, \"Yeah, he said everybody.\" On a more serious note, Carson noted the \"divisiveness and the hatred\" in today's society. \"We have a war on virtually everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imagine, we have people at each other's throat,\" he said. \"And our strength is actually in our unity.\" Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Kasich touted his economic record as governor of Ohio. \"Our wages are growing faster than the national average,\" he said. \"We're running surpluses.

It's time to take our country back.\" Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Huckabee laughs during the debate, which was hosted by the Fox Business Network.

Did you know that they are talking about bringing it to Broadway? That would be so amazing, because William Goldman wrote the book right here in NYC!\n\nHave you seen any Broadway shows recently? I think you would just LOVE \"Hamilton.\" Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote it and it's very historical. He's from Washington Heights and he's so talented. I'm warning you that it's hard to get tickets, but I'm sure you have some \"in\" somewhere. And check out \"Kinky Boots\" and \"Fun Home\" if you can. You won't be sorry!\n\nI wish I had more time to write, but I have so much to do.

    "text": "Washington (CNN) As authorities scramble to find ways to prevent the next mass terror plot, a new technology could change those investigations: high-speed analytics aimed at helping law enforcement find terrorist plotters -- and stop them before they attack.\n\nIt is the kind of cyber resource that Hillary Clinton has seized on for her proposed \"intelligence surge\" to defeat ISIS and other terrorist threats as they recruit adherents and plan attacks using online tools.\n\nMeeting with national security experts in September, Clinton said an area of deep focus was \"what it would take to surge our intelligence, to help us detect and prevent attacks before they happen.\"\n\nIn Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Clinton's running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, said the pair would work to strike \"great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.\"\n\nBut the reliance on technology deepens legal and ethical concerns that civil liberties groups and other natural allies of the Democratic Party have about law enforcement's use of data and technology, and its monitoring of social media.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website 00:33\n\nThe Justice Department's announcement Wednesday of the arrest of a National Security Agency contractor for allegedly stealing classified intelligence only underscored the challenges and sensitivities of boosting such surveillance.\n\nThe expanding uses of technology and new capabilities in particular have raised alarm bells at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\"There really hasn't been an adequate discussion of this or adequate appreciation in the broader public or attention by legislators for the consequences on our political discourse or our democracy writ large,\" said Hugh Handeyside, a staff attorney for the ACLU's National Security Project.\n\nHe continued, \"It's just beginning to dawn on us that just because this capability exists, doesn't mean it should be used.\"\n\nPredictive analytical tool\n\nThe analytic tool, called \"graph technology,\" isn't about sucking up more data; it's about being able to more efficiently sift through it. Experts say it can be used to spot signs of imminent cyber attacks, such as the theft of Democratic National Committee emails or other hacking attempts on voter registration systems in 20 states.\n\nThey maintain that graph technology, initially released about seven years ago, would work equally well in hunting down terrorist cells.\n\n\"We think in the next few years, tech will be able to help in a much greater way\" with national security work, said Mark Testoni, president of SAP National Security Services.\n\n\"We've doubled the entirety of digital information in the entire world in the last two or three years,\" said Testoni, who added that when you apply high-speed analytics like graph technology to this mass of information, \"It offers great promise.\"\n\n\"It's not just the traditional data,\" he explained, referring to social media and data on individuals, but resources like \"geospatial information, too.\"\n\nThat includes mapping data and images collected by satellites, drones and aircraft, as well as GPS waypoints, census information and other data tied to specific locations.\n\n\"This is the great promise and hope,\" Testoni said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mike Morell full interview Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mike Morell full interview 08:46\n\nClinton's call for more intelligence capabilities -- human and cyber tools -- to deal with terrorism includes better cooperation between local, state and federal agencies within the US; more robust intelligence sharing among US allies, particularly in Europe; and improved intelligence gathering in the Middle East, including surveillance, reconnaissance and collecting information from both data and human sources.\n\nJim Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that a cyber surge could be crucial as ISIS loses ground in Syria and tries \"to slip more into the West.\"\n\n\"The way we used to protect ourselves may not work so well in the future,\" Lewis said. \"In some areas we're going to have to increase what we do, and big data may be a part of that.\"\n\nThe newer capabilities of graph technology can be used to find patterns by looking at how data is connected and the nature of those connections.\n\nFor example, an investigator could use a graph to find everyone who went to high school with an individual or shared the same address. It's a very sophisticated version of the technology that Facebook uses to send \"friend\" suggestions.\n\nThose connections can be used to build algorithms that can spot anomalies or flag certain activities based on previous patterns. If a bank has ever contacted you because of suspicious activity on your account, you've experienced the power of these algorithms.\n\nExperts say that this resource could help identify patterns of activity that preceded past terror attacks or cyber hacks. By programming the software to search data for those patterns, investigators can then look more closely to see whether other hacks or plots are indeed underway.\n\n\"We're starting to see strong adaption of the technology\" by national security agencies, said Emil Eifrem, CEO of Neo Technology, the San Mateo, California, firm that invented the approach and coined the term \"graph technology.\"\n\nPreventing cyber attacks\n\nWhile Eifrem said that the technology isn't yet being used in \"predictive ways\" for national security, he said it could easily help point to imminent cyber intrusions of the kind seen on voter registration systems and the DNC.\n\nUsing graph technology, for instance, you could identify the network of IP addresses used in attacks, the central server the addresses link back to and the way these addresses were used.\n\n\"What isn't being done yet,\" said Eifrem, \"is that you embed all that in the graph database, so you can start predicting it ahead of time,\" and say, \"based on network traffic that we've seen before, we suspect we're going to see a breach attempt.\"\n\nThe technology \"translates identically, completely, into national security\" for investigators looking for connections between terrorists or other plotters, according to Eifrem.\n\n\"The tension is with civil liberties, but in terms of efficiency, the more data you have, the better,\" he said.\n\nThe data collection is already well underway.\n\nSecurity and intelligence agencies already collect a great deal of data, even if they might not yet be applying graph technology analysis to it.\n\nNational security agencies have added \"socmint\" -- or social media intelligence -- to the traditional ways of collecting intelligence: \"humint,\" or human intelligence, the information collected by people; and \"sigint,\" or signals intelligence, information pulled from electronic signals such as radar or weapons and communications systems.\n\nUS security agencies are now using and investing in social media monitoring tools like SocioSpyder, Dataminr, Geofeedia and PATHAR that scrape the web for information.\n\nCivil liberties concerns\n\n\"The way the government is doing this amounts to surveillance,\" said Handeyside of the ACLU.\n\nNeo Technology's software is already being used by US agencies. It's also been bought by a foreign equivalent of the US State Department that's trying to merge databases across its government to create a single view of its citizens.\n\n\"There tends to be a great deal of faith in the capacity of technology to ferret this out and basically predict the future,\" said the ACLU's Handeyside.\n\n\"But we're getting into very dangerous territory if we're talking about gobbling up more and more information about what people are saying, who they're communicating with, and where they're praying, and using that as the raw intel for making these kinds of judgments,\" he said.\n\nThere are some limits on government agency's access to data, of course. Beyond the publicly available streams of information on sites like Twitter and Facebook, law enforcement agencies like the FBI have to go through certain steps to gain any kind of access to a suspect's private accounts.\n\nThey're first required to send the suspect's email provider a National Security Letter asking, for example, for the suspect's search history. If that yields enough information to warrant further investigation, then they have to issue a search warrant to look more closely.\n\nUS intelligence agencies operate under different rules internationally, with more stringent limits on its approach to US citizens as opposed to non-citizens.\n\nClinton has said there's a need to tackle the \"thorny challenge\" of navigating security concerns and civil liberties, particularly surrounding encryption of mobile decides and communications.\n\nShe has expressed a preference for more targeted data collection over bulk data collection and supports the USA Freedom Act, the 2015 law that scaled back bulk collection of US citizens' telecommunications data by US intelligence agencies.\n\nIn the wake of 2013 disclosures by the NSA contractor Edward Snowden of the extent of surveillance, lawmakers believed creating the new law would restore Americans' trust.\n\nEven so, distrust about the extent of collection and the reach of intelligence agencies persists. And even if a potential Clinton administration did succeed in moving forward with such an \"intelligence surge,\" the graph technology is no panacea.\n\nLewis of CSIS said these new tools \"probably could have predicted the attacks in Europe\" that were larger, such as the Paris attacks or the March attack in Belgium. He and other security experts say that French intelligence agencies were hampered because they haven't updated their capabilities.\n\n\"The French didn't keep up, didn't invest in data analytics,\" Lewis said. \"If you aren't looking at the data, you aren't going to find people.\"\n\nBut there are limits, he said.\n\n\"How do I create a program that's good at predicting who will be a lone wolf?\" he asked. \"It's harder to predict who's going to be a terrorist than it is to predict credit card fraud. We're not very good at that.\"",

But it's a heightened version of themselves, and one that is often shaped by the not-so-light-touch of reality TV producers.\n\nAudiences love a villain -- especially in their reality TV shows.

Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Photos: Baseball's biggest scandals Barry Bonds: Perjury indictment \u2013 Barry Bonds is baseball's all-time home run leader, but some commentators say there should be an asterisk by his record. Though he's said he never knowingly used steroids, two San Francisco reporters wrote a book alleging he used performance-enhancing drugs. In 2007, he was indicted on charges of perjury and obstructing justice for allegedly lying to a grand jury investigating steroids and convicted of obstruction of justice. Here are some of Major League Baseball's biggest scandals: Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Photos: Baseball's biggest scandals Roger Clemens: Steroid allegations \u2013 Known as Rocket for his aggressive pitching style, Roger Clemens played pro ball for more than two decades, racking up seven Cy Young Awards.

Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Photos: Baseball's biggest scandals John Rocker: Outrageous comments \u2013 John Rocker's pitching career with the Atlanta Braves only lasted a few seasons because of his offensive comments about homosexuals, New Yorkers, Asian women and a black teammate in a Sports Illustrated article.

It did not specify a model.\n\nThe commission suggested people use only the delicate cycle to wash bedding and water-resistant and bulky items because the lower spin speed \"lessens the risk of impact injuries or property damage due to the washing machine becoming dislodged.\"\n\nThe agency said it is working with Samsung on a remedy.\n\nRelated: U.S. formally recalls Samsung Galaxy Note 7\n\nThe warning comes more than a month after Samsung was hit with a federal class-action lawsuit by customers who said their machines had exploded during use.\n\nCustomers in Texas, Georgia and Indiana all said they were washing clothes when they heard a violent boom.\n\nA washer belonging to a McAllen, Texas, woman \"exploded with such ferocity that it penetrated the interior wall of her garage,\" according to court filings. A woman in Dallas, Georgia, said it felt and sounded as if \"a bomb went off.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, references similar reports collected by local news and filed online with regulators. It also claims Samsung \"has moved aggressively to collect and destroy all evidence of the defective machines\" after they exploded.\n\n\"We're very glad that CPSC is getting involved here,\" said Jason Lichtman, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. \"We think it's important that the scope of the problem be identified as quickly as possible.\"\n\nRelated: Samsung customer says his new Note 7 phone burst into flames\n\nSamsung declined comment on the litigation. It directed CNNMoney to a statement on its website that says the company is talking to U.S. authorities about how to address potential safety problems.\n\n\"In rare cases, affected units may experience abnormal vibrations that could pose a risk of personal injury or property damage when washing bedding, bulky or water-resistant items,\" the statement says.\n\nSamsung also said its customers \"have completed hundreds of millions of loads without incident since 2011.\"\n\nSamsung (SSNLF) earlier this month said it would replace 2.5 million of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after reports of battery fires. And this week, a tech worker in China, which was not part of the recall, told CNNMoney that his device burst into flames while charging.",

    "text": "I was born premature, two months ahead of schedule in February 1975, missing my hair and my nails and weighing a mere 4 pounds, 11 ounces. I was so tiny and fragile that my father could hold me in the palm of his hand.\n\nRight from the start, grit was in my blood. But it took decades of trying life experiences and an introduction to the sport of mixed martial arts for me to realize that.\n\nToday, I'm 41 and a single mom of two amazing kids. By day, I'm an owner and operator of a preschool and daycare center in upstate New York.\n\nBy night, I train in a sport that's often wrongly seen as just a bloody, knockout fight. For me, MMA has been the connection to who I truly am: a fighter. At 5'1\" and 100 pounds, I'm still very small, but now I know I'm mighty in strength and spirit.\n\nMalinda Diffee, MMA fighter, strikes a pose in the cage.\n\nLike most people, I've faced many different struggles and challenges in my life. I grew up as one of eight siblings, and while my family didn't have much monetarily, we had an abundance of love. I was blessed to be raised in a loving home.\n\nBut by the time I reached my 30s, I found myself in an abusive relationship. It was the most difficult time of my life. Sadly, it continued and only grew worse.\n\nSeveral years into this period, I came across an open house at a local gym where they were offering kickboxing and self-defense classes. I stopped in, started class that night and was hooked.\n\nKickboxing soon became my stress relief, my sanity and my therapy. Those workouts were the two days a week I could fight back. I didn't have to be that fragile, quiet girl; I could be strong, tough and defend myself.\n\nI started seeing and feeling the change in myself, both inside and out. I found the courage to put my foot down and stand up for myself. I was able to put an end to an unhealthy relationship and pursue a happy, healthy life without fear, for myself and my kids. They are my whole world and a huge part of my daily motivation.\n\nJUST WATCHED Inside the world of female MMA fighters Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Inside the world of female MMA fighters 01:29\n\nThat kickboxing class also opened the door to MMA, in which fighters use a mix of different disciplines, from jiu-jitsu and judo to wrestling and boxing. In 2012, I was training in a new gym, and coaches there approached me and told me, \"You've got fire in you; you are a fighter. You should be training to be in that cage.\"\n\nSo that's what I did. I started taking boxing lessons and sparring several nights a week, going round for round with the guys. I would spar with anyone, any size.\n\nMalinda Diffee competes in the cage.\n\nI was the only female at our gym who was actually training to compete in MMA and fight in the cage\u2014the octagon-shaped ring where MMA matches take place.\n\nI feel the biggest misconception about this sport is that it's all about brutality. I wish people could see what we fighters see: the honor and respect that is a part of what we do. When I train, I'm not training to hurt someone. I'm training to be the strongest I can be. How much can my body take? How much willpower do I have?\n\nIt would empower me even more knowing I could take a kick or a punch and then get back up and give it right back! My goal was to never quit, never back down, and to make myself stronger each day. I reached that goal and surpassed it, thanks to my MMA coaches and teammates over the years who made me into the fighter I am today.\n\nIn MMA, the people you train with are like family. We have each other's backs and push each other to our greatest potential and possibilities. The bond we make and the honor we have is like no other sport I have been involved with.\n\nJUST WATCHED Chasing her dream six days a week Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chasing her dream six days a week 01:26\n\nDo I want to win when I meet my opponent in the cage? Absolutely! Does that mean my opponent and I will get injured along the way? Yes, most likely. But with most sports there is always a risk of injuries. Win or lose, you should do it humbly, honoring yourself, your opponent, your team and your family.\n\nTo be an MMA fighter is something I'm very proud of. As a woman, I've been shunned, criticized and judged by some people. Like it's OK for a man to be a fighter, but not OK for me as a woman. When I continue to fight in spite of that, it's to show other women and young girls, including my 18-year-old daughter, that it's OK to be a woman and be strong. It's OK to stand up for yourself.\n\nTo the men and young boys, including my 21-year-old son, I hope seeing women in MMA encourages them to respect all women. To see them as equals in strength and as athletes. Not something you can control, mistreat or abuse, threaten or try to intimidate through bullying or fear.\n\nI know I don't have to tell my son this. He is a respectable young man and treats all women with honor. He thinks of his mom as a badass\u2014and I'm pretty proud of that.",

    "text": "CNN is working together with Italy\u2019s Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) to educate young people across the country about human trafficking and modern-day slavery.\n\nA Memorandum of Understanding signed in Rome by Minister of Education Stefania Giannini and CNN Freedom Project Executive Editor Leif Coorlim agreed to incorporate the ground-breaking CNN Freedom Project into the Italian education system. Effective from this current year, CNN Freedom Project materials will be made available through the network of educational institutions across Italy.\n\nUnder the agreement \u2013 facilitated by CNN International Commercial and CNN Freedom Project supporter The Essam & Dalal Obaid Foundation (EDOF) \u2013 video material from CNN Freedom Project will be used to increase awareness about human trafficking and modern-day slavery among Italian students. The award-winning journalism \u2013 spanning reports, documentaries and digital content \u2013 will be used in classrooms to promote practical solutions to improving the care of people affected by such issues. Italian students will also be encouraged to join and contribute to the CNN Freedom Project\u2019s efforts.\n\nThis development is part of the Italian government\u2019s initiative to tackle such issues at a time when there is greater risk of human trafficking due to increased levels of migration across Europe. The initiative is the latest step in CNN\u2019s commitment to helping end modern-day slavery through the CNN Freedom Project.\n\nWith a remit to enact change, educate and advocate against human trafficking, CNN Freedom Project special reports and documentaries have been on CNN International since 2011. Since it was founded, CNN Freedom Project has provided documented evidence leading to the rescue of over 1,000 people worldwide, sparked over $24 million in donations to anti-trafficking organisations, changed laws and corporate policy and inspired NGOs and campaigns around the world. The project has won dozens of journalism and human rights awards, and the U.S. State Department last year honoured CNN International Executive Vice President and Managing Director Tony Maddox as a 2015 Trafficking in Persons Report Hero.\n\nLeif Coorlim, Executive Editor, CNN Freedom Project, said: \u201cThe CNN Freedom Project has told hundreds of stories across the globe, focusing on all types of modern-day slavery. In that time, we\u2019ve come to understand education as a key component to solving this problem. If young people are aware of the risks, they can avoid being trafficked. If they know the signs of trafficking, it may lead to identifying victims and saving lives. That\u2019s why this agreement is so important. We commend the Italian Ministry of Education for its forthright leadership in addressing this issue, and hope more school systems will follow its example.\u201d\n\nStefania Giannini, Minister of Education, said: \"Education is crucial to help solving the problem of all types of modern-day slavery. If young people know the signs of trafficking, it may help to identifying victims and saving lives. For this reason, knowing the commitment of the CNN Freedom Project on this issue, we launched a cooperation project between the Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) and CNN aimed at distributing CNN Freedom Project-created content as educational materials within Italian school to increase awareness about human trafficking and modern-day slavery and encouraging Italian students to join and/or contribute to the CNN Freedom Project\u2019s efforts. We are proud to be the first Ministry in the world to co-operate with the CNN Freedom Project in addressing this issue.\u201d\n\nCNN Freedom Project is supported by The Essam & Dalal Obaid Foundation (EDOF), which shares the same values of the initiative and has a commitment to pursue peace and remedy injustices in areas such as human trafficking. EDOF has supported CNN Freedom Project since March 2015 and collaborated with CNN on a number of initiatives including a high-profile special event at Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center that explored ways that elected officials, policymakers, law enforcement, activists and survivors can combat modern slavery.\n\nEnds\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\n\n\nDan Faulks\n\nVice President, Communications\n\nCNN International Commercial\n\nTel: + 44 20 7693 1362\n\nDan.Faulks@turner.com\n\nAbout CNN International\n\nCNN\u2019s portfolio of news and information services is available in seven different languages across all major TV, digital and mobile platforms reaching more than 420 million households around the globe.

Back then, we had a flamboyant millionaire, several crusaders demanding a return to \"traditional\" families, calls for a wall to keep out immigrants and of course another Clinton and Bush (although the 1992 Bush candidate didn't crash and burn so early).\n\nThat same year I published a book titled \"The Way We Never Were,\" warning against the dangers of imagining we could recapture a largely mythical golden age anywhere in the past.\n\nStephanie Coontz\n\nOne big difference, though, was in 1992, nostalgia was the stock in trade of social conservatives pining for the supposedly idyllic families of the \"Father Knows Best\" era. Today, by contrast, liberals and moderates are also jumping onto the nostalgia bandwagon, harking back to the political bipartisanship of earlier days. Donald Trump says \"make America great again,\" and Hillary Clinton counters with an appeal to \"make America whole again.\"\n\nBut just exactly what era do they have in mind? And how many of their followers would actually like to live in the conditions that prevailed then?\n\nNo question, it is tempting to look backward. Listening to the drumbeat of attacks on Planned Parenthood raises wistful memories of 1964, when two former presidents, Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat Harry Truman -- no kidding -- were honorary co-chairs of that organization.",

For so long, we have been conditioned and programmed to fear young black men that we don't care about one another. There's this divide and conquer mentality that has been going on for so long -- all the way to slavery. It's unfair drug laws. I believe things like the prison industrial complex, that's real. That's modern day slavery. When we say black lives matter, we're not really stepping out there saying 'oh we're mad at an individual.' I truly believe it's a systemic problem.

It's a varied situation of making sure you make it home safely because ultimately that's all everyone wants to do. That's all the officers want to do. That's all the young person wants to do. Everyone just wants to get home safely. If we can respect each other in that sense as human beings, then I believe it's at least the right conversation to have. Dr. King always said it best, 'You've got to learn to live together as brothers or we are going to perish together as fools.'\n\nWhen it comes to Instagram, it seems like you're very thoughtful about what you post. What's your thinking behind what you put out there?\n\nThe beauty of Instagram, for me, is that it does come off in an artistic way. Where on Twitter, it's just words.\n\nYou went through a really public divorce with Mariah Carey. You seem like you both co-parent really amicably. How do you do that?\n\nI think that's what everyone should do. It goes back to that idea of you're supposed to be good parents. You take a situation that may not be so good and you make the best out of it. More than anything, I thank and appreciate my children. If anything, they are the ones that have to suffer through our schedules and our lives not coinciding with what we wish it would be regionally. I have amazing children. That's the main goal is to be the best parents to those children. Mariah and I are both on that same page. That's all we want is the best for our children.\n\nLeaving the Haters in the Wind! LOL They want us to be mad so bad! @MariahCarey but we happier than happy! #HappyFathersDay A photo posted by Nick Cannon (@nickcannon) on Jun 19, 2016 at 4:39pm PDT\n\nWould you ever get married again?\n\nNever. Not a chance. I'm firm I would never get married again. You can write that in stone.\n\nYou've been open about your battle with lupus. Tell me about how you're doing now?\n\nI'm doing great, now. My doctor would probably say I need more sleep but proper exercise, putting the right things in your body and having people around you who care about your well-being is really important as well. Being healthy is a full-time job.\n\nWhat's the most fun part about hosting America's Got Talent?\n\nThe kids. I love every aspect of seeing a young person accomplish their dreams. It's something magical when you see a kid out there that's uber talented and you see an entire theater go crazy for them. You see this glow of potential over this young person. It's unreal.\n\nLast Night was a great one!! #AGT #NCREDIBLE A photo posted by Nick Cannon (@nickcannon) on Jul 27, 2016 at 2:06pm PDT\n\nDo you feel like your role is even more important and meaningful because you know that young men and women are looking up to you?\n\nWhether it's 'America's Got Talent,' or whether it's 'Wild N Out' or whether it's sitting here speaking to you, I always want to be the best me I can possibly be; uphold not just the legacy of African American men but just uphold my family values. I want to make my grandmother proud. I think if we all come from a place like that, it really resonates in a way to where we all want to be examples. I never want to be a role model, though. I believe a role is something you play. I attempt to be a real model and be as real as possible.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign Saturday night seized on a New York Times report about Donald Trump's 1995 tax records, in which the Times showed he declared a $916 million loss that could have allowed him to legally skip paying federal income taxes for years.\n\nThe revelations threatened to put the controversy over Trump's refusal to follow recent precedent and release his tax returns at the center of the presidential campaign less than 40 days before the election, after a week in which the Republican nominee has struggled to bounce back from a debate in which most analysts and scientifically conducted polls scored Clinton as the winner.\n\nHis campaign vehemently pushed back on the Clinton campaign's effort to turn the report into an \"October surprise\" moment, saying Trump has a \"fiduciary responsibility\" as a businessman to pay no more tax than legally required. It also charged that the report proved that the Times and the \"establishment media\" are merely an arm of the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe report contains some of the most detail of Trump's financial empire that has been publicly reported. It was immediately picked up by Clinton's campaign, which has sought to make Trump's refusal to release his tax returns a major issue of the campaign.\n\nCalling it a \"bombshell report,\" the Clinton campaign said the Times' article \"reveals the colossal nature of Donald Trump's past business failures and just how long he may have avoided paying any federal income taxes whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump \"apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades\u2014while tens of millions of working families paid theirs.\" pic.twitter.com/g62jB9fKr5\n\nThe Times' report shows Trump that year declared a $916 million loss and lists tax benefits he used after a turbulent financial period for him in the early 1990s. The paper, citing tax experts, said Trump could have used his loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income for nearly two decades.\n\nThe paper says it obtained the three pages of documents when they were mailed to a reporter last month. A postmark indicated the documents were mailed from New York City, and the return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower.\n\nThe paper did not look at his federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax return as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump's 4 business bankruptcies in 2 minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump's 4 business bankruptcies in 2 minutes 01:57\n\nCNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity.\n\nTrump himself responded via Twitter on Sunday morning, saying: \"I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes.\"\n\nI know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2016\n\n\"I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!\" he added.\n\nI have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2016\n\nIn its statement issued Saturday night, the Trump campaign said the GOP nominee has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in other taxes, including property and real estate taxes.\n\n\"The only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that The New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Trump campaign statement was notable because it did not directly deny the allegations in the Times report. It also noted that though Trump had paid some taxes, it did not specifically say he had paid income tax.\n\nA central issue\n\nTrump has maintained that his tax returns in recent years are under audit and that he has been advised by his lawyers that it would be unwise to release them while that process is going on. However, there is no legal reason why someone under audit cannot make their tax records public while they are running for office. Candidates for president have released their tax returns for decades.\n\nJUST WATCHED 5 times Trump was live fact-checked at the debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 5 times Trump was live fact-checked at the debate 02:37\n\nBut by refusing to release his tax returns, Trump, who has broken every other rule of politics during his stunning outsider campaign, has been, in effect, betting that he can outlast the demands of opponents who want to make his tax history a pivotal issue in the end game of the campaign.\n\nThe impact of the revelations in the Times story were difficult to gauge in their immediate aftermath.\n\nBut they seem certain to keep the issue of Trump's tax returns and questions about his business prowess -- which are at the center of his public image and rationale for running for president -- at the center of the campaign over the next week.\n\nTrump has just endured a rough week after scientifically conducted polls and most analysts agreed that he lost the crucial first presidential debate to Clinton. Early polling after the debate also appears to indicate Clinton is getting a modest boost from her performance.\n\nThe Republican nominee has also spent the week in a war of words with Venezuelan-born former beauty queen Alicia Machado, who was mentioned in the debate as a woman who had been the victim of unflattering rhetoric by Trump. The feud plays into Clinton campaign charges that Trump harbors prejudice against women and Hispanics -- two crucial demographics that could help decide November's election.\n\nJUST WATCHED Donald Trump weighs in on weight Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump weighs in on weight 01:31\n\nThe issue could be next scrutinized at the vice presidential debate on Tuesday, forcing Trump's running mate, Mike Pence -- who has released his tax returns -- on the defensive. Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, have also released their returns.\n\nWill voters care?\n\nThe extent to which Trump's tax controversies will damage him could also take time to play out.\n\nBut there is evidence that a majority of voters believe it is important that candidates for president release their tax records.\n\nIn a Monmouth University poll last month for instance, 62% of those asked thought it was very important or somewhat important for candidates to show their tax records.\n\nTrump's decision not to release his tax returns is a complicated issue politically, and the controversy shows the complications of someone like Trump, with a vast business empire, running for president.\n\nOn the one hand, conservatives have long viewed the Internal Revenue Service with disdain and it has long been a plank of the Republican Party's orthodoxy that taxes should be lowered across the board. The GOP also sought to make political capital out of claims that the Obama administration used the IRS to target the tax-exempted status of conservative grassroots and Tea Party groups.\n\nSo it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Trump's core voters, who harbor deep suspicion of the federal government, would applaud his efforts to avoid some tax liability -- as long as he acted within the law.\n\nBut Trump's appeal in Rust Belt swing states has been aimed directly at voters who feel they have been left behind by the uneven economic recovery -- and who see Wall Street figures with vast means as able to use legal maneuvers to escape the kind of tax burden that ordinary middle-class voters must bear.\n\nSo far, Trump has been able to position himself as the scourge of high finance and the New York financial elite -- despite having moved in proximity to such circles for decades. Saturday's Times report is likely to make it more complicated for him to pull off that feat.\n\nIt may also undermine Trump's self image as a consummate dealmaker and businessman. He repeatedly argues that he has created a \"great company\" worth billions of dollars and implicitly argued that expertise equips him to manage the US economy and renegotiate what he has styled as global trade deals that disadvantage the United States. Anything that contradicts that image could be politically damaging.\n\nPhotos: The week in politics U.S. President Barack Obama stands beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, front right, at the funeral of former Israeli President Shimon Peres on Friday, September 30.

The Democratic nominee accused the billionaire of refusing to release his returns because he wanted to hide how little tax he had paid.\n\n\"That makes me smart,\" Trump replied, and also said that any tax money he had paid would have been wasted by the federal government.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: I'm 'smart' for paying no taxes Replay More Videos ...

Indians will be able to use Jio for free until the end of 2016, and pay as little as 149 rupees ($2.25) a month for data after that.\n\n\"Anything and everything that can go digital is going digital -- at an exponential rate,\" Ambani told investors last week at his company's annual general meeting. \"Life is going digital.\"\n\nOnly one fifth of adults in India have access to the Internet. Few public Wi-Fi spots exist, and fast broadband connections require infrastructure that is rarely found in poorer urban areas, much less rural ones.\n\nBut that is changing fast. If the Jio network succeeds, Ambani will be able to capitalize on a seismic shift that could see hundreds of millions of Indians come online in the coming years -- in most cases via a smartphone.\n\nIt's a market that tech industry giants desperately want to crack. Google (GOOG) has installed free Wi-Fi at train stations across India, and Facebook (FB, Tech30) tried to offer a free version of its platform.\n\nAmbani has invested billions constructing nearly 100,000 telecoms towers across India. He estimates that Jio already covers some 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages. By March 2017, his aim is to reach 90% of the population.\n\nBuilding a national 4G network from scratch represents a major risk for Ambani, who got out of telecoms about 15 years ago after a dispute with his brother, Anil Ambani, who controls Reliance Communications.\n\nThe brothers, who together are estimated to be worth $26 billion, have patched things up in recent years. Jio will be able to use radio frequencies owned by Reliance Communications.\n\nRelated: 900 million Indians can't get online. Here's why.\n\nRival networks have responded to the launch of Reliance Jio with special offers of their own, making a price war a near certainty. Airtel has slashed its prices for 3G and 4G service by 80%, and Vodafone (VOD) has boosted the amount of data in its plans by nearly 70%.\n\nIf Jio, which means \"live life\" in Hindi, is to become another mega business in Reliance's stable of energy, media, chemicals and retail operations, the network will have to be able to handle the load from millions of new customers.\n\nOn Tuesday in New Delhi, a device on the Reliance network was showing impressive download speeds of 21 megabits per second. With $20 billion at stake, that kind of performance needs to be replicated across India.\n\n-- Huizhong Wu contributed reporting.",

    "text": "Michael Smart is an assistant professor of transportation planning at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The views expressed are his own.\n\n(CNN) Imagine being able to travel from New York to Los Angeles without having to step on a plane, yet be able to do so in a fraction of the time it would take to drive. On the surface, that tantalizing prospect took a step closer with the news last month that a Japanese maglev train had reached a top speed of close to 400 mph, breaking its own world record in the process.\n\nAnd the sight of futuristic looking trains whizzing past platforms at hundreds of miles per hour isn't confined to Japan: China, France and Spain, to name a few, have their own high-speed rail networks. Indeed, while these bullet trains may look futuristic, they have been around for decades; they're a tried and tested technology that the Japanese debuted over 50 years ago.\n\nSo surely it's only a matter of time before large numbers of U.S. passengers are doing a daily commute to New York from Washington and Boston in about the time it would take them to drive to work in their own cities, right?\n\nNot anytime soon.\n\nWhile several countries have undertaken the tough work of raising the money to invest in bullet trains, it's unlikely the United States will ever see the vast network of high-speed trains that blanket other countries. Indeed, passenger rail service in the United States lags behind much of the rest of the developed world, for several reasons.\n\nFor a start, much of the United States is not exactly an ideal market for high-speed rail. Compared to places where rail really flourishes -- Japan and Western Europe, for instance -- the United States is geographically vast. As a result, in much of the country, cities are far enough apart that air travel provides significant time savings, even compared to some of the fastest trains.\n\nJUST WATCHED Japan's trains as safe as they are fast Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan's trains as safe as they are fast 02:19\n\nThe layout of cities matters, too. When you arrive in Tokyo, Paris or Barcelona, it's often convenient (and even pleasant) to walk to your final destination. When it's not, a fast and frequent mass transportation system awaits to whisk you away. This is not the case in many American cities, where arriving by train typically means jumping into a cab or renting a car for the last leg of your journey. Simply put, in many sprawling U.S. cities, getting to your destination by train can still mean you've got quite a way yet to get home. We could change that. And we probably should. But we're not there yet.\n\nStill, there are several parts of the United States where high-speed rail makes a great deal of sense.\n\nThe Northeast Corridor (Boston-New York-Washington) comes in at the top of just about every list of potential candidates for high-speed rail, with the distances involved being considered within the \"Goldilocks\" zone for fast trains. For example, at just over 200 miles from New York to both Boston and Washington, fast trains could compete with even faster airplanes by offering centrally located stations and providing an alternative to the hassle of airport security lines. These cities are dense, have strong downtowns, and extensive mass transit systems once you arrive.\n\nJust as importantly, rail on the Northeast Corridor can also compete with driving, mainly because traffic congestion makes driving in the region so slow and unreliable, while tolls and parking costs can make it an expensive and time-consuming option. Rail in the northeast even has a great track record; after Amtrak's almost-high-speed Acela service began on the Northeast Corridor in 2000, ridership exploded, quickly outstripping air travel between New York and Washington.\n\nHowever, the biggest barrier to improved rail service in the United States is simply the lack of political will. At the federal level, support for passenger rail service has languished and Washington has devolved decision-making (and increasingly, funding) to the states. With the nation's transportation trust fund nearly broke and no permanent solution in sight, it seems unlikely the federal government will champion high-speed rail -- a costly endeavor -- in the near future.\n\nWithout leadership from the federal government, the states are largely in control. Yet many of the most promising corridors for high-speed rail cross state lines, making it difficult to plan for better rail service. In 2009, the Obama administration awarded nearly a billion dollars of stimulus money to plan and upgrade a high-speed rail line connecting Chicago to Milwaukee and Madison. A year later, Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, rejected his state's portion of the money and the project was, for the time being, at least, derailed. (The money quickly found its way to a grateful California for its high-speed rail line.)\n\nStill, all is not lost for those hoping to see high-speed rail in the United States.\n\nJUST WATCHED California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours 01:17\n\nCalifornia is committed to building its high-speed rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles, paying for the line largely with state money raised by a new cap-and-trade market on carbon emissions. Several privately funded projects are also in the planning stages. For instance, a Dallas-to-Houston line promises 205 mph service in 2021 without a single dollar from the taxpayer. Meanwhile, another private company has already begun construction on a Miami-to-Orlando line with a more modest speed of 125 mph, with service expected to begin in 2017.\n\nAll this points to how high-speed rail will likely progress in the United States: piecemeal. It is doubtful that we will have a nationwide system of fast trains soon. And this is not necessarily a bad thing; through a combination of private and public action, we should target markets where high-speed rail makes sense. That means looking for shorter corridors connecting dense places with existing mass transit infrastructure.\n\nHigh-speed rail won't be cheap, so we'll have to choose wisely. Some of the most promising corridors are also the most expensive; Amtrak estimates upgrading the Northeast Corridor to true high-speed rail would cost upward of $150 billion . Such an undertaking requires careful consideration of the economic, environmental and other costs and benefits of individual projects. But more importantly, it requires the kind of long-term planning that seems to have become vanishingly rare.\n\nThankfully, high-speed rail doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach. And while given the choice I would rather be riding Japan's speeding bullet trains, even the incremental improvements we've seen in services like Amtrak's Acela can make rail travel a lot more appealing for the hundreds of thousands of passengers who rely on it every year.\n\nRead CNN Opinion's Flipboard magazine.",

    "text": "I went undercover in Southeast Asia to learn why a bizarre, scale-covered mammal -- which has been called a walking pinecone and a modern-day dinosaur -- is trafficked by the ton. It could go extinct before most people realize it exists. You voted for me to cover this topic as part of CNN's Change the List project .\n\nJohn D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion and head of CNN's Change the List project. Follow him on Twitter, Facebook or Google+. E-mail him at ctl@cnn.com. The opinions expressed in this story are solely those of the author. . Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam (CNN) Inside a metal vault here in rural Vietnam is a creature believed to be the most trafficked mammal in the world. No sounds come from its cage. No squeaks or howls. A padlocked door creaks open to reveal an animal that seems far too unassuming to be traded by the ton. It looks like a ... \"Dragon,\u201d I say. \"Artichoke,\u201d says a colleague. \"His name is P8,\" a researcher says. But everyone calls him Lucky. If you hear his story it's easy to understand why. Lucky is a pangolin -- a rare, scale-covered mammal, about the size of a house cat, that\u2019s so bizarre it almost forces your brain to flip through a Rolodex of more-familiar images. It could be described as a walking pinecone or an artichoke with legs \u2013 a tiny dinosaur or friendly crocodile. The pangolin possesses none of the cachet of better-known animals that are hot on the international black market. It lacks the tiger\u2019s grace, the rhino\u2019s brute strength. If the pangolin went to high school, it would be the drama geek -- elusive, nocturnal, rarely appreciated and barely understood. When it's frightened, it actually curls up into a roly-poly ball. The pangolin could go extinct before most people realize it exists. Or, more to the point: It could go extinct because of that. Pangolins -- two species of which are endangered and all of which are protected by international treaty -- are trafficked by the thousands for their scales, which are boiled off their bodies for use in traditional medicine; for their meat, which is a high-end delicacy here and in China; and for their blood, which is seen as a healing tonic. \"It's almost like, 'You've got a pangolin you've got a brown bag lunch -- and also a medicine chest,'\" said Crawford Allan, director of TRAFFIC North America and a pangolin lover. (He's got a wooden carving of a pangolin in his office in Washington.) The numbers are astounding. By the most conservative estimates, 10,000 pangolins are trafficked illegally each year. If you assume only 10% to 20% of the actual trade is reported by the news media, the true number trafficked over a two-year period was 116,990 to 233,980, according to Annamiticus, an advocacy group. No one knows how many pangolins are left in the wild. But scientists and activists say the number is shrinking fast. Some experts say the pangolin is likely the most trafficked mammal in the world. It\u2019s impossible to say for certain, of course, because poachers don\u2019t exactly submit spreadsheets on their activities. But aside from pangolins, only elephants would come close to the most-trafficked title in terms of total numbers, said Dan Challender, co-chair of the pangolin specialist group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Kent. Yet, few seem to care. International environmental groups and governments have been slow to fund pangolin research and rescue. You don\u2019t see them on the cover of National Geographic. You rarely find them in marketing campaigns. On a two-week trip to Vietnam and Indonesia, I did come across a few pangolin enthusiasts who have dedicated their lives to saving these curious creatures. DIGITAL DOC: Inside the illegal animal trade Video by John. D. Sutter and Edythe McNamee/CNN The activists and researchers are doing amazing, helpful work. But they have vastly inadequate support. On this trip, I wanted to figure out why that\u2019s happening -- and what might be done to stop the pangolin from going extinct. After meeting Lucky at a pangolin rehabilitation and rescue center in Vietnam, I set out to trace his path in reverse. How does a pangolin end up in the illegal trade in the first place? Who runs these operations? What are their motives? How could the trade be shut down? The journey would take me to restaurants and medicine shops where pangolin is sold; to meet with mafia-type pangolin bosses (one of whom offered to sell me -- me who wears hipster glasses, isn\u2019t buff and looks nothing like he belongs in the wildlife mafia -- three tons of pangolins, live); and ended with me running around the forests of Sumatra, Indonesia, learning from poachers exactly why and how they hunt pangolin. It's possible you've read this far and still are thinking: Why does this matter? That's a question -- and I probably shouldn't admit this up front -- I found myself asking again and again on this trip. It nagged at me from one location to the next, like a thorn stuck in my side. But if you want to understand pangolins -- or the illegal wildlife trade in general \u2013 it is perhaps the essential question. It's the one I needed to answer.\n\nI'd never heard of pangolins. I got weirdly obsessed with them only after CNN readers voted last year for me to cover illegal wildlife trafficking as part of my Change the List project, which focuses on bringing attention to bottom-of-the-list issues and places. When I started calling up experts on this topic, I had no idea what they were talking about. Have you heard of the pangolin? one wildlife expert asked by phone. Ummmm, I said, frantically typing into Google. How do you spell that again? The more I learned, however, the more I fell in love with this awkward underdog. Do a quick YouTube search (P-A-N-G-O-L-I-N) and I'm sure you will, too. Among the gems you'll find: Baby pangolins riding around on their mothers' tails. Pangolins sticking out their tongues, which are longer than their bodies. (The tongues can be longer than a foot, and they actually start at the pelvis.) Chinese pangolins roaming around with ears that look almost human. African pangolins toddling on their back legs, like mini-T-Rexes. And my favorite: Pangolins rolling up into scale-covered balls to protect themselves from lions and tigers, which just bat at them, seemingly confused. Pangolins, it turns out, are pretty much invincible in the wild. We're their only credible threat.\n\nWhen the door opened to Lucky's cage, he didn't appear to be alive. He was just this nautilus of rust-colored scales, all spiraled up in a ball inside that underground metal box, which was connected by a concrete pipe to his cage, or \"pangolarium,\" as it's called here at Cuc Phuong National Park. I'd arrived at the park late that morning after driving about 3\u00bd hours from Hanoi, past enormous gumdrop mountains and flooded rice paddies that reflected perfect rectangles of sky when the sun peeked through the rain. Phuong Quang Tran, a researcher who introduced me to Lucky, met me at the gate of the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program, just outside the park. The setting reminded me of the TV show \"Lost,\" with person-sized ferns and aging concrete buildings covered in moss. The gate at Pangolin Rehab, as I'll call it, is topped with barbed wire. Hidden cameras perch on the property like birds of prey. With pangolins, it turns out, you can't be too careful. I had to dip my boots in two vats of chemical disinfectant before I was allowed into the pangolarium. This was for the pangolins' protection, not mine. \"We don't know why they die,\" Phuong said matter-of-factly. But it happens frequently in captivity. Lucky is the biggest and friendliest pangolin at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam. He weighed only 4 pounds when he was seized from the wildlife trade. He now weighs 17 pounds. JM for CNN These pangolins have avoided a major cause of pangolin death -- poaching -- because they were found in shipments that were intercepted by the Vietnamese government, bound for markets in Hanoi or, by road, to China. Here, they face new threats. Maybe it's the food that kills them, Phuong said. There's not been enough research on what pangolins eat in the wild to know for certain what their caregivers should feed them in captivity. Pangolin Rehab has been relatively successful with a combination of frozen ants (25%), soy (35%) and silkworm larvae (50%). Yet they still have occasional digestive problems. And the stress of captivity alone can be fatal. It's one reason you rarely -- almost never, actually -- see them in zoos. (The San Diego Zoo is the only one in North America that has a pangolin. His name is Baba. The zoo used to have two pangolins, but one died of digestive problems, according to Jenny Mehlow, a spokeswoman for the zoo.) It's hard to overstate the amount of stress that trafficking routes put on pangolins. They're not happy travelers. Often they haven't had food or water for days and are perilously dehydrated. Forty percent die within a day or two of arriving at the center, Phuong told me. The rest are injected with hydrating fluids and kept in quarantine until they can be moved to a larger cage. Sources: TRAFFIC, South Africa and IUCN. Note: Rhino numbers are for South Africa only. All of this made me a little nervous to meet Lucky. After standing there for a minute, I saw him breathing. It was hard to notice at first, but the hexagonal scales on his back rose and fell in a slow, oceanic motion. He must have smelled us, because his slender, toothless snout started to peek out of the ball like a cobra rising from a snake charmer's basket. Soon, he was looking at us with curious blueberry eyes, bobbing his head and sniffing the air. The photographer, who asked not to be identified in this story because he lives in Vietnam and fears retribution, got right in his face -- SNAP SNAP SNAP -- and Lucky just kept investigating the scene, putting his nose right up against the lens. \"He's performing,\" Phuong said with a smile. After Lucky had a few dozen photos taken, a worker from Pangolin Rehab picked up the pangolin -- wait, what? -- and passed him over to me. I tried to refuse at first, but I could tell this was happening whether I wanted it to or not. He felt like a lump of bricks in my arms, and a squirmy one. He's one of the biggest pangolins in the world in captivity, Phuong told me. He weighs about 8 kilos, or 17 pounds. Lucky wrapped his girthy pangolin body around my forearm, scales and claws pinching my skin, and held on tight. His stomach was warm and hairy, a somewhat awkward reminder that this otherwise reptilian-looking thing is actually a mammal. His body clamped around my arm like a giant snap bracelet. \"Careful, he's very strong,\" Phuong said. I could tell. This animal must have the abs of Pink. And, this is embarrassing, but I kind of wanted him off of me. Partly to have my arm back. And mostly because I didn't want to drop him. I'm bad at holding babies. Just think how much I could stress out a pangolin.\n\nAfter meeting Lucky, I sat in the office at Pangolin Rehab with Phuong and rattled off what I thought would be a ridiculously softball list of questions about pangolins: How long do they live? How big do they get? What's their gestation period? What do they eat in the wild, and how much? Are they solitary or do they live in pairs? Phuong, who has talked about pangolins at international conferences, couldn't answer any of these with specificity. No one can. It's known that pangolins can live up to 20 years in captivity, for example, but it's not clear exactly how long they live in the wild. Pangolins eat ants, termites and various larvae, but it's also possible they consume bee larvae, flies, worms and crickets, according to a 2007 technical review of pangolin diets and husbandry. Estimates on their weight range from 4 to 72 pounds. Pangolins are a near-complete scientific mystery. And it's not hard to see why if you keep poking around. Next question: What's your annual budget? Answer: $27,000. That includes a staff of seven, the rehab program at Cuc Phuong National Park, and a program to release pangolins at C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park in the south of Vietnam.

John Sutter/CNN [+] Click to enlarge Pangolins are traded by the ton, frozen and alive. They're sometimes mixed with frozen fish or snakes as cover. Courtesy TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Governments and international conservation organizations tend to put their muscle behind \"charismatic\" species like the rhino or elephant, which are seen in zoos worldwide and are universally beloved. But pangolins, as a volunteer at Pangolin Rehab, Thai Van Nguyen, explained it to me, are \"not a very attractive species -- not beautiful, not colorful. \"Some people -- Western people -- think it's a crocodile.\" It's true that more attention has been coming the pangolin's way recently. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature hosted World Pangolin Day on February 15, the day before I left for Vietnam. The main celebration seemed to be rallying support online. Some news organizations -- from Yale Environment 360 to the BBC -- have posted videos and articles. And, out of dumb luck and because he's a nice guy, I somehow persuaded the creator of that \"honey badger\" YouTube video to make a new (hopefully) viral video about pangolins as part of this story. But the pangolin, as writer Richard Conniff put it, is still \"obscure\" at best. In the public mind, it's definitely no rhino. When I tell people about pangolins, they often think I'm saying \"penguin\" with some newly acquired Paula Deen accent. Perhaps no one would miss a species they never knew existed. The Pangolin Rehab researchers and others don't see it as an accident that we know so little about pangolins. It's a bias, and I agree. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says the sunda pangolin population (which includes Lucky) likely has declined by 50% in recent years -- but nobody knows what baseline the species is starting from. An update is due out later this year, but the only thing clear about pangolin science is how little of it is being done, and that's because so little of it is being funded. What we're left with is anecdotal evidence, like the stories I heard from Thai in Vietnam. He grew up here, not far from Cuc Phuong National Park, and remembers seeing pangolins outside the park when he was a kid. Now, he said, it would be impossible to find a wild pangolin anywhere nearby. You could sit outside all night -- night after night -- and never, ever see one.\n\nI spent two nights at Cuc Phuong National Park, and the longer I stayed the more I started feeling like a pangolin. That's weird, I know, but it's not entirely without precedent. A few years ago, children's author Anna Dewdney (if you have young kids, they probably know her \"Llama Llama\" series) visited Cuc Phong to see pangolins before she wrote the book, \"Roly Poly Pangolin,\" about a shy animal that learns to make friends. She based it on her experiences at the park. \"They're like little tiny dog dragons,\" she told me. \"They look like dragons but they're completely nonaggressive and when they get to know you they're very friendly. They're very shy. They're like small children. So they don't warm up to you right away but once they know you, they bond.\" Her boyfriend recommended she look into doing a book on pangolins because he'd read about them somewhere, and they reminded him of her. Dewdney's awesome, so she didn't take offense at that. \"As a small child, when I felt overwhelmed or terrified of situations, what I would do is go off by myself and draw. I would go to my room and shut the door. And it's still what I do. I can't live in a city because of the constant barrage of things and people. I live in Vermont where it's generally very quiet. \"When I feel overwhelmed, I shut the door and be by myself in my own little safe world. Pangolins do that at any given moment. They just curl up into a ball and they are in their own little world in that way. Literally, they look like a little round planet.\" A little round planet. I love that. Pangolins are trafficked by land and sea in Southeast Asia and China. As supplies dwindle in the region, pangolin is also being sourced from Africa, experts say. Source: Education for Nature Vietnam I'm not much of a visual artist, but I think almost anyone can see a bit of themselves in those stories. I was an awkward kid, bad at baseball, good at gymnastics; I think all of us encounter situations in which it might be advantageous to curl up into a ball of armor and safely wait out the world. I would feel that way later on this trip, in Sumatra, meeting with the mafia-esque wildlife traffickers. At Cuc Phuong, I stayed in what seemed like an abandoned building. There was no heat, and the windows didn't shut all the way. I felt like a pangolin as I burrowed under all the blankets I could find, trying to stay warm during the 40-degree nights, curling up in a ball. My first night in the park, I stayed up late to try to see one of the nocturnal pangolins in action. It's difficult to glimpse them because they emerge from their burrows for only several minutes at a time and then return to safety. I was lucky enough to catch a pangolin known only as P21 rummaging about that night. This pangolin, I learned, was quarantined for three years (three years!) not because she was sick but because the center didn't have enough money or room to move her into the larger pangolarium. The night I saw her, she seemed to want to release some of that pent-up energy. At first, all I heard was a sound -- the clanging of a fence, which sounded like a person banging on a typewriter. I looked up to see P21 skittering across the chain-link cage. She seemed to be enjoying herself, running up the fence, across a tree branch -- then, suddenly, up my thigh. She looked at me cockeyed for a moment and then went back to her rounds. The new honey badger Remember the viral video about the honey badger? That guy made a new video about pangolins in collaboration with CNN. Watch it here. Read full story \u00bb All that was cute, but P21 won me over when she latched her back legs and muscular tail onto the fence and levitated into the air -- her entire body stretched out horizontally, her claws reaching forward in a Superwoman pangolin pose. She stayed that way for quite a long time, sniffing the air. She probably was looking for ants, but I imagined her wanting to fly. A pangolin with a dream. The next night, I saw Lucky in action. Phuong brought an ant nest and propped it up in his cage. It wasn't long before he smelled the ants. I heard him sniffing the air -- SNNNF SNNNF SNNNF -- like the sound a motorized air pump makes when you're topping off a car tire's pressure. Lucky's not as quick-moving as the other pangolins, but there was something magical about seeing him in his element -- out in his cage at night. I found myself smiling ear to ear, laughing for no reason. It's usually true that the more time you spend trying to get to know someone, the better you identify with him or her, and the more you like each other. That was the case with Lucky and me. I learned -- when he wasn't attached to my arm -- that Lucky is the only pangolin at Pangolin Rehab with a nickname. He got it from Thai, the spiky-haired, motorcycle-riding volunteer who rescued him from a warehouse in December 2006, after the government seized 60-some pangolins. Officials told Thai, as he recounted it to me, that he only could rescue the five pangolins that weighed the least. Pangolins, like cocaine, are sold by weight. And the officials planned to resell the heavier pangolins at auction to benefit the government. (That corrupt but formerly legal practice has since been discontinued, a government environmental official told me. He did not deny that such auctions had taken place in the past. Environmentalists would prefer the pangolins be euthanized so they don't go into the illegal market and end up feeding demand for the animals.) Lucky was one of the smallest pangolins. Totally expendable. And that's precisely why he made it.\n\nTime-out for a quiz: Is the pangolin your spirit animal? Answer yes or no to these five questions. You sleep all day and party all night. (Partying may or may not include swinging from trees by your tail and/or eating ants). When confronted with an awkward situation, you run away and hide. You're not so sure about that whole \"pairing off\" thing. #solitarylife You get so stressed out that sometimes you could just, I mean, like, die. If you answered yes to any of these questions then -- congratulations! -- you might just be a pangolin person. Maybe it's best to keep this to yourself ...\n\nT here were six pangolins when I arrived at Pangolin Rehab and five by the time I left. Thankfully, none of them died of journalist-related stress. But one of them, P26, did leave for a new home. Name this walking pinecone CNN readers are going to come up with a better name for this uber-shy pangolin. He's currently known as P26. Read full story \u00bb His car arrived around 4 a.m. I met Phuong around 3 to watch him get the paperwork ready. The previous day, he'd affixed a radio-tracking device to P26's tail by drilling two holes in one of his scales. P26 is doing what Phuong hopes all of the pangolins here will eventually do: He's going back to the wild, to a national park in the south of Vietnam, where the climate is warmer and the threat of being hunted is a little lower. So far, the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program has released five pangolins in C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park. Researchers are trying to prove such releases are viable, but three of the pangolins have lost their tracking devices (Phuong put P26's lower on his tail, in hopes that might help) and one of their transmitter batteries died. In January, one of the pangolins that had been released died as well. It's unclear what exactly happened, Phuong said. His guess? Stress. \"It's a very sad story.\" That was Phuong's favorite pangolin, the liveliest of the bunch. Lucky, one of the other pangolins that's gotten to him personally, likely will never be released into a park, Phuong told me. The researchers give the pangolins tests to see if they're ready for release. They hide their food, bury it slightly underground, monitor them more closely. The goal is to see if they're ready to fend for themselves in the wild -- or if they've gotten accustomed to life in captivity. Lucky could never pass, Phuong said. He wouldn't dig for the food. He waits to be served. He's too used to humans. Phuong Quang Tran prepares to put live ants in a dish for a pangolin named Lucky. JM for CNN I kept my headlamp on as I followed Phuong past the vats of foot disinfectant and to the quarantine cage where P26 was waiting. Phuong helped move him into a wooden box he'd made by hand. It's the kind of animal carrier you'd expect to see in a cartoon: holes on the side for air, packing slip attached to the top. P26 would be driven to Hanoi, then flown to Ho Chi Minh City, and then driven to C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park, where he would be released, on March 17. I could tell Phuong was worried as he watched the car disappear in the pre-dawn darkness. \"OK, good luck to you!\" he said in a singsong way that sounded almost like a prayer. I was told later by Louise Fletcher, who handles pangolin releases at C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park, that researchers put P26 out in the park inside a box, opened it, and waited for him to run. This was no \"Free Willy\" moment. He didn't budge. So they left the box out there overnight, hoping this pangolin -- thought to be the shyest of all these Morrissey types -- finally would get up the nerve to leave.\n\nI said goodbye to the Pangolin Rehab center early the next day, thinking how lucky I was to have met some of these amazingly bizarre animals, each with its own personality and characteristics. P8 is huge. P26 is shy. P21 is an acrobat. None is just like the next. There's something wonderful about encountering a creature you had no idea existed, and that millions of years of evolution helped create. The earliest pangolin fossils date back to the Eocene epoch, 35 million to 55 million years ago, shortly after the dinosaurs went extinct. It once was thought that pangolins were most closely related to anteaters, sloths and armadillos. New evidence, however, suggests they may be more similar to carnivorans, a diverse group of animals that includes cats, civets, dogs and pandas. All eight species of pangolin, four in Africa and four in Asia, are in the order Pholidota, which is made up entirely of pangolins. The name pangolin comes from a Malay word meaning \"one that rolls up.\" Just realizing they're alive -- and in such an otherworldly form -- has a certain magic to it. And then there are all the little surprises -- that P21 can levitate; that P8's sniffing sounds like a DustBuster; that their scales feel like balsa wood; and that they can cover their eyes and ears so ants don't crawl in while they're eating. They're curious little bastards. And I developed an unlikely fondness for them. Which made the next leg of my trip all the harder.\n\nFrom Cuc Phuong National Park, I drove to Hanoi, a bustling, old-world city that's overrun by honking motorbikes and old women wearing cone-shaped hats. The city is known for its spicy pho, or noodle soup, which customers eat while sitting at plastic, outdoor tables sized for 2-year-olds. The soup is lovely. You often don't have to order. Just sit down and a bucket-sized bowl arrives in no time, clouds of steam rising from the broth. There's little chance you'll be served noodle soup with pangolin. The meat is far too expensive. To eat pangolin, you have to go looking. And you need lots of cash. With the help of a wildlife crime investigator from the group Education for Nature Vietnam, I went out in search of restaurants that sell pangolin meat. I was a little nervous about this for several reasons: It's illegal to buy and sell pangolin; I was filming with a hidden camera; and I really didn't want to eat a pangolin. My editor, however, did want me to order it -- both to prove that it's possible and to find out what it tastes like. What if it's delicious? she asked before I left. I squirmed at the thought of it. Like I'm going to come back proclaiming pangolin the new pork belly? The first stop we made was at a high-end restaurant with a regal-looking lion etched into its window. The entryway was lined with fish tanks, and the hostess stood beside a fan of peacock feathers fashioned into a kind of indoor palm tree. All of the waitresses were dressed alike: sherbet-orange blazers and gold polka-dot dresses. One showed us a menu. In the \"wild animal\" section, near the back, was a picture of a live pangolin. (Imagine, for a moment, a U.S. menu with an image of a live chicken on it -- well, outside the show \"Portlandia.\") It was labeled clearly -- and the \"appetizing\" preparation options included: \"blood wine,\" \"stir-fried pangolin skin with onion and mushroom,\" pangolin \"steamed with ginger and citronella,\" pangolin \"steamed with Chinese traditional medicine\"; and, for the unadventurous, the people who would rather eat pangolin at Chili's, there's \"grilled\" pangolin, too. Pangolin could be prepared in about 30 minutes, a waitress said with a smile. You have to order it whole, at a minimum of 5 kilos (11 pounds). Price: $350 per kilo. Or $1,750. (Maybe it's best to split it with a group). I considered ordering it right then, although I wondered how I would account for an endangered-animal meal on a CNN expense report. Sir, it seems you've exceeded your per diem limit. Traditional medicine has a long history in Vietnam and China. Pangolin scales are made of the same material as fingernails but are claimed to help with lactation issues and other ailments. JM for CNN I talked it over with Z, the wildlife investigator who was my tour guide and whose identity I'm withholding because he continues to investigate the wildlife trade in Vietnam undercover. He suggested that I not place the order \u2013 or that he didn't want to be a part of it if I did. I'd be giving a substantial amount of money to a black-market industry, he said. And I'd also be ensuring that one specific live pangolin (I thought of Lucky in this moment) would end up dead. That last part didn't quite make sense to me. I figured pangolins, like chicken or whatever, would already be dead in a meat freezer in the kitchen. Consequently, I figured I could argue (to myself and to you) that I hadn't actually killed a pangolin by ordering it. It was already dead. See! Not my fault! But that's not how it works. As the waitress explained, with the poise of a \"Downton Abbey\" cast member, the staff would bring the pangolin out to the table live -- and slit its throat. Right in front of us. Think of it as a quality assurance measure, designed to prove to us that we indeed were eating real, endangered pangolin. Not a substitute. Won't the blood get everywhere? I asked, realizing that's probably not a question a genuine pangolin eater would actually be concerned with. No, she said, giggling. Of course it wouldn't. And we'll serve the blood to you with wine if you'd like. Rattled by this -- they slit its throat at your table?! -- I asked for more info about the preparation methods. Another waitress, within earshot, approached us with her phone. This is what it looks like, she said, pulling up a photo of a pangolin lying on its back on a plate, stubby little legs sticking up in the air, claws curled under. Was this served here? I asked. Yes. Have you ever tasted it? Yes. What does it taste like? Delicious. I needed to think this over. Thanks, I said. Maybe we'll be back.\n\n\"What does pangolin taste like?\" Super-scientific poll results: Like the absolute best thing you've ever tasted. (This remark came from another waitress in Hanoi. I pressed for details on what the \"best thing you've ever tasted\" actually tasted like. She looked confused by this.) \"It's chewy, like chicken.\" \"It tasted like chicken.\" Gamey, like duck. \"Good, but not too good.\" Good enough that you would eat it again? \"No, I have hypertension.\" \"It tastes like ants.\" One man was served pangolin at an end-of-year university party. Another ate it not to blow his cover as an investigator.\n\nIn November, the Vietnamese government issued a decree bumping pangolins up to the highest category of legal protection, banning any use, sale or possession of live or dead pangolin, according to Do Quang Tung, the government's director of CITES, the United Nations treaty that governs trade of endangered species of plants and animals. The maximum penalty, he said, is $25,000 or seven years in prison. Strike two for eating pangolin, right? Maybe not. Enforcement doesn't exactly sound rigorous. At another restaurant, the waitress actually told me ordering pangolin is legal. And here's an excerpt from my conversation with Tung: Me: \"When I was in the country recently it was fairly easy to find stores selling pangolin scales and restaurants selling pangolin meat. I'm wondering what your comment is on that. It was my impression -- and it's the impression of some environmental groups -- that this material is sold fairly openly.\" Tung: \"This selling is not allowed in Vietnam.\" Me: \"Does it happen though?\" Tung: \"No.\" Me: \"It's something that I saw there firsthand ...\" Tung, backtracking: \"Yes, of course there have been some restaurants or some areas selling that, but it's illegal now.\" \"Of course there have been.\" More like there are. I found pangolin meat for sale in three restaurants; pangolin scales for sale in three traditional medicine shops; and a disturbing pangolin product on display at a fourth restaurant in Hanoi. All of this was in a matter of hours. At the fourth restaurant, we saw four glass jars displayed prominently on the back wall of the dining room. Three of the jars were covered in red velvet, and all were under spotlights. With the permission of the wait staff, but without identifying myself as a journalist, Z and I pulled back the cloth on the covered jars. Floating lizards, bear arms, king cobra. And pangolin. Floating in rice wine. The pangolin's tongue hung grotesquely out of its mouth. No way I'm drinking that, I thought. (And it would be impossible now, I'm told, since the pangolin wine was removed after Z reported it to the police). But the next day, we did go back to the throat-slitting restaurant.\n\nComposite menu of endangered wildlife: For Hanoi, Vietnam; prices according to Z and other staff at Education for Nature Vietnam, unless otherwise noted; all health benefits are, of course, alleged but unproven and irresponsible: Rhino horn: ground into a powder and used to cure hangovers, cancers and to remove toxins from the body. According to a report in The Guardian, a rumor that a former Vietnamese official was cured of cancer by eating rhino horn drove up demand and helped ensure that the last rhino in Vietnam was poached. The cancer connection has no basis in fact and no roots in traditional Chinese medicine, that report says. Price: $50,000 to $60,000 per kilo. Tiger bone glue: Made into a gelatin with other animal parts, including those from serow, a type of goat, and macaque monkey bone; used allegedly to relieve pain, treat bone disease and improve male sexual performance. Price: $10,000 per kilo. Tiger penis wine: Claimed to improve sexual performance. Price: Unknown. Bear bile: Allegedly cures skin disease, including discoloration from bruising; claimed to heal broken bones; seen as a general health remedy. Price: $1 to $6 per cc. Pangolin: Eaten as a delicacy and to show off. Price: $250 to $350 per kilo. Pangolin scales: Ground up and eaten as an alleged treatment for lactation issues, blood circulation problems and cancer. One prescription I received: Grind up four scales per day and eat them with rice. Continue for seven days. It might taste funky, but just add sugar. Price: $600 to $1,000 per kilo. Pangolin tongue: In China, I'm told by a separate investigator, pangolin tongue (yes, that foot-long tongue) is dried and carried in a person's pocket as a good luck charm, kind of like a rabbit's foot. Price: unknown. Pangolin fetus: Eaten for alleged health benefits. Price: unknown.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to rationalize a pangolin purchase. Here in Vietnam, it's a sign you've made it. The country is still communist -- red flag, yellow star -- but its economy, like China's, has opened up and boomed in recent years. Status culture has followed. I saw at least three couples in Hanoi taking their wedding photos -- like their actual, for-real wedding photos, white dresses and the whole bit -- in front of the logo for a Louis-Vuitton store. Eating rhino horn, tiger bone or pangolin meat has a similar effect. We're rich, y'all. Take a look. Who cares whether the animal is rare, right? The point is it's expensive. Like eating other exotic animals, it's a \"VIP-only\" experience, one pangolin eater told me. The argument is different for pangolin scales. They're sold for about $600 per kilo in clear plastic bags in traditional medicine shops in Hanoi. Dried and curled, they look like seashells or pork rinds. Not exactly appetizing. But a history spanning thousands of years emphasizes the use of pangolin scales to cure lactation issues in women. When I went into these shops, I was also told the scales, when ground up and eaten with rice, can solve blood circulation problems and cure cancer. It's not about status, it's about alleged healing. It matters less whether this actually works (keep in mind pangolin scales literally are made of the same material found in fingernails) than that people believe it does. Neither of those arguments works well for me. I'm not a member of the Vietnamese nouveau riche. And, thankfully, no one's asking me to lactate. The more persuasive argument is that I've eaten rare animals before.

John Sutter/CNN [+] Click to enlarge Pangolin scales are sold in traditional medicine shops like those found in an old quarter of Hanoi. JM for CNN Pangolin fetus is an unproven aphrodisiac. Courtesy TRAFFIC Southeast Asia On assignment for CNN in Alaska, for example, I ate walrus stew, with hair still on the chunks of blubbery meat; and dried seal meat, which I dipped in \"seal oil.\" I didn't seek out a walrus- and seal-eating experiences. But I was staying in remote indigenous villages, and families were kind enough to offer these dishes to me. I thought it would be unthinkably rude to refuse. Why not just buckle down and order pangolin? These thoughts ran through my mind as Z and I went back to the first restaurant and sat down at a table. There was a dark part of me that wanted to eat a pangolin. Who isn't curious about the new or forbidden? What does it taste like? The preparation method didn't actually matter that much to me. In a way, it's more honest and ethical to watch an animal's throat be slit in front of you than to pretend, as most of us do in America, that worse things don't happen in factory farms, far outside our restaurants and kept, intentionally, far from sight and mind. We're big hypocrites when it comes to animals in America, and I'll include myself in that assessment. I've always been a meat eater, but I have given that up, at least temporarily, following this reporting trip. People here in Hanoi eat dogs, which we'd never dream of doing. But Americans eat pigs, and they're just as smart and loving. For pangolins, what matters is that they're rare. And they're faced with the prospect of extinction. I thought about Lucky. I understood the consequences of ordering pangolin, both for an animal I'd weirdly come to care about -- and for a criminal enterprise that's linked in with other nasty networks. One pangolin boss in Vietnam is nicknamed \"Iron Face,\" and she's thought to deal in other illicit goods as well. Some pangolin bosses are known to trade rhino horn, for instance. (The last Javan rhino in Vietnam was poached in 2010, according to World Wildlife Fund. Now, as few as 35 individuals remain, all of them outside this country.) Other wildlife crime networks have been linked to Al-Shabaab, the East African militant group that the United States identifies as a terrorist organization, and to the smuggling of arms and drugs, which even people who aren't animal lovers can agree is bad. It's selfishness and ignorance, all of it. Because I knew all that, I couldn't stomach pangolin. I wanted to -- for the thrill of it, mostly, and for the story -- but I couldn't. Z and I got the pho instead.\n\nIt's impossible to say exactly where Lucky and the other trafficked pangolins in Vietnam came from. But there's reason to suspect Indonesia, the 253-million-person nation made up of thousands of islands that straddle the equator. In August 2013, nearly 7 tons of pangolins from Indonesia were seized at a port in Haiphong, Vietnam. In 2008, almost 14 tons of pangolins, frozen, were seized in Sumatra, the westernmost island, likely bound for Vietnam or China. The man responsible for that 14-ton bust -- I'll call him Q to protect his identity -- picked me up at the airport in Sumatra. He's a put-together guy who wears button-up shirts, parts his hair in the middle and listens to jazz. He also leads a double life. He works as an undercover wildlife investigator for an international organization. His young children think he's unemployed. Q has been able to pull off that deception because of personal connections. Someone in Q's network (I'm not saying exactly who) once was a tiger-trading and slaughtering kingpin. Ask him about it and Q matter-of-factly says that this man is partly responsible for the fact that there are only 400-some tigers left in Sumatra. But Q is making good on that connection. He uses his link to a now-deceased trafficker to get access to criminal wildlife-trading networks. And then he shuts them down. He's had a surprising amount of success. I asked Q to help me understand the supply side of the pangolin trade. Where do the pangolins come from, and how are they shipped for export? He towed me into that world, which felt at times like I was being pulled into an episode of \"CSI\" or \"Weeds.\" I hoped the whole thing wouldn't end up like \"Locked Up Abroad\" -- me in jail, or worse, left in the hands of cutthroat traffickers. Q wasn't too reassuring on that front. At breakfast before we set off to meet with one of the pangolin mafiosi, he dropped on the table a jar containing a dead, baby pangolin floating in a yellow liquid. A trafficker we were going to meet gave this to Q as a gift, he told me. Q plays every situation, dangerous or not, with a smile and a joke. But Q knew I would be taping the interview with two hidden cameras. He knew what could happen if this guy noticed. \"Big boss,\" he kept telling me in heavily accented English. \"Big boss.\" Subtext: Don't end up like that pangolin in the jar.\n\nEncounters with pangolin mafia, incident 1 of 2: The first member of Sumatra's wildlife-trading mafia who Q helped me meet looked like Barack Obama -- cropped hair, coffee skin, a toothpaste-commercial smile. That lightened the mood a bit. I walked past his spiked gate, up the driveway and into his living room, which has a large rug with a lion's head on it. The trafficker, whose identity I'm withholding since I did not identify myself as a journalist, displayed a strange fondness for pangolins for someone who admitted to buying them from hunters and arranging their transport to larger cities. (Q told him that I also was involved in the illegal wildlife trade in order to hold his cover). He built an entire room for pangolins in his house, in the Lebong district of Sumatra, but he couldn't keep them inside, he told me. [+] Click to enlarge The good news: Some former hunters are now trying to protect the pangolin. The bad news: Pangolin is easy to find on menus in Hanoi. Some restaurants slit its throat in front of customers. JM for CNN [+] Click to enlarge In February, a restaurant in Hanoi kept this pangolin floating in rice wine. CNN reporter John Sutter was told it was removed after authorities were called. John Sutter/CNN They kept digging their way out through the tile floor. \"Oh, I think this animal is very smart!\" the trafficker said, lighting up. This man seemed to think pangolins had video-game-like powers. He told me the pangolins tried to escape from his house by curling up into balls and then spinning with Sonic-the-Hedgehog speed to burrow through the floor. He said they can hide underwater for upwards of 15 minutes without air. And he told me their blood has magical healing properties -- four of them. \"My boss says if you want to make medicine from pangolins, you take rice wine and boil it with a baby pangolin, and put it in a jar,\" he said in a local dialect, which I recorded and had translated later. \"You don't have to mix it with other ingredients, you just boil it with the wine and you put it in a jar. Every morning you drink one small cup -- and it can heal you from disease. There are four ways it will help: First, for skin disease. Second, it will make you always feel fresh. It will help you breathe easily (that's three) \u2026 and I forget what the fourth reason is.\" I would let the four-reasons thing go, except that he kept going with it: \"I guarantee you, if you drink that wine, you will get healed from those four diseases.\" Right, four. He said he's gotten out of the pangolin trading business recently because it's risky to ship them. He was trying to move pangolins by car from his town to Palembang for export (usually to Vietnam, he said). The car's tire popped on the way and police threatened to confiscate the 1-ton load of pangolins in the back. \"We had to pay about 300 million (rupiah, or $26,000) to get the pangolins and car out of there,\" he said. He laughed about the bribe. Police threw in a free spare tire as part of the deal. \"With money,\" he said, \"you can make everything easy.\"\n\nThere was a time, perhaps a decade ago, when pangolins were so common in some parts of Indonesia that people literally hit them with their cars. Three such car-pangolin crashes were described to me on my trip. From them I can draw two conclusions: This never happens anymore because pangolins are so rare. Pangolins are tougher than cars. None of the pangolins died on impact. The drivers said they checked.\n\nEncounters with pangolin mafia, incident 2 of 2: \"Would you like to see the snakes?\" That's a question that, in normal life, I would always say no to \u2026 100% of the time. But on assignment in Sumatra, in a wildlife trafficker's living room, I had to say yes. I kind of wanted to say yes. The trafficker, the one who gave Q the pangolin in a jar, looked like every drug dealer you've seen cast for a U.S. TV series -- surfer shorts, button-up, short-sleeve shirt, slouchy-but-I'll-kill-you demeanor. He led me into his back hallway and opened the door to what appeared to be (or formerly was) a bathroom. Dozens of rice sacks were tied at the top and each, from my understanding, contained a live python. I didn't quite believe that until this man grabbed one of the bags and dumped out a 12-foot python at my feet -- my bare feet, by the way. I jumped like a meerkat -- directly over the snake, which was slithering at me, and fast. The trafficker and my translator thought this was pretty hilarious. Where do you go from there except back to the sitting room to talk about trafficking pangolins? From my chair by the door, I could see the trafficker's kids around the corner watching TV and playing with little-kid toys. One (no joke) was holding a helium balloon in the shape of a panda, an endangered animal. Q explained to me later that this trafficker uses pythons as a cover for his pangolin shipments. He puts them on top, because pythons can be shipped out of Sumatra with a permit and under a certain quota. I asked the trafficker if I could see a pangolin (this was probably overly bold in retrospect) and he declined. But he did make an offer. \"Yes, there are plenty of pangolins here,\" he told me, thinking that, because I'd come with Q, perhaps I wanted to strike up a deal. \"If you have enough money, for one month, I could supply you with two or three tons\" of pangolins. He asked for an inflated price \u2013 the Chinese price, he said. Three tons for about $790,000. Some time ago, he would have accepted maybe a third of that. But it's getting harder to ship pangolins out of Sumatra, he said, both because there's more police presence (thanks probably to the bust Q orchestrated in 2008) and because customers in Vietnam and China now demand live pangolins, for slaughter at the table, and live pangolins are more difficult to pack into cars and drive around. Tellingly, none of that means the trade will stop -- it just means it's more expensive. \"I have connections at every level of the police force in the region,\" the trafficker said. \"I have to pay them every month -- about 15 million\" rupiah, or $1,300 total.\n\nLearn to speak trafficker! In addition to having their own nicknames -- \"Iron Face,\" \"Golden Scales\" -- wildlife traffickers also speak in their own code language. A key, courtesy of Q: \"08\" = whole tiger \"Yellow bamboo\" = ivory \"CB\" = rhino horn \"TH,\" or \"tonti\" = pangolin \"Jacket\" = tiger skin\n\nKetenong, population 580, is squished between two picturesque national parks in South Sumatra Province. That makes it prime poaching territory. No one here cared about pangolins -- never gave them a thought -- until a few years ago when a wildlife trader from Bengkulu came to town. Ruslan, a 58-year-old who used to hunt pangolin, remembers the man well -- and what he promised. \"You find pangolins, and I'll give you money.\" Simple enough. So Ruslan did. A wiry man with porcupine hair and a raspy, Joan Rivers voice, Ruslan worked in the rice fields by day, then climbed into the forest at night to hunt pangolin. He didn't know it was illegal, but he got quite good at it. Some pangolin hunters say they're just trying to support their families. They use the money to buy milk, not luxury items. John Sutter/CNN Ruslan, 58, and another pangolin hunter, Ropi, a 29-year-old who wears a pink backpack, showed me one night what it's like to go on a pangolin hunt. Both men told me they're not currently hunting pangolin, but they took me into the forest to show me how it's done. I asked them not to actually trap any pangolins on my behalf. Let me just tell you, pangolin hunting is hard work. A few notes from my journal entry that night: \"Holy s***! That's work! Trudging through mud that's shin deep. There could be tigers or rhinos to chase you down. Looking for an animal some consider satanic. When you hit it with a flashlight (which we didn't) it looks like a ghost -- you see its red, beady eyes. Crossed rivers I don't know how many times. I don't know why I didn't lead with the leeches. I only got one leech stuck to my shoulder, but my traveling companions all had more. One had seven. We were out in the forest for maybe two hours, patrolling like security guards with flashlights. It's almost impossible to watch where you're going and look for pangolins, which means you're often sliding down mud-covered mountainsides, getting stuck in tangles of ferns and vines and plants with spikes on them. I reiterate: This is hard. \"The second hunter climbed up a slippery cliff, hoisting himself up vines, chopping down other vegetation with a machete. The first grabbed my hand to pull me up to a (pangolin) nest -- shone light on the \"tracks,\" which were so faint in the Martian red mud that I couldn't see them even with his guidance.\" Ruslan helped me understand the experience by summing it up this way: \"If we were rich people, we wouldn't want to go into the forest to hunt pangolin.\" We didn't find a pangolin, but the experience was enlightening. Pangolin hunting is the worst. And it hasn't made Ruslan and Ropi rich. They're not motivated by greed. They're not buying fancy cars -- any cars -- or big, showy houses. I went in both men's homes. Ruslan's cache of electronics includes a (non-smart) cellphone, a small TV and a rice cooker. Ropi lives in a humble wood home that appeared to have two rooms. Their village only got electricity two years ago -- and many rice farmers here only earn the equivalent of about $2 per day. This is a desperate place. Ropi told me he only considers going out to hunt pangolin again when he sees his two young children, a boy and a girl, and realizes that, without the extra income from the hunt, he doesn't have enough money to buy them milk. People in this part of Indonesia once saw the pangolin as cursed. Find one in your house and someone in your family might die soon -- or the house might burn down. Some people, according to Q, even believed that pangolins were mystical, almost satanic. If lightning struck, they could disappear in a flash. Now those beliefs are gone. International demand has infected this place. \"I think when you find the pangolin you are lucky,\" Ropi told me. \"You can change the pangolin (into) money.\"\n\nEstimated value of a pangolin: To a hunter in Indonesia: $18 to $27 per kilo To a low-level trader in Indonesia: $45 per kilo To a mid-level trader in Indonesia: $80 per kilo To a high-level international trader: $265 per kilo To a restaurant in Vietnam: $350 per kilo I told one of the hunters, who had been getting $18 to $27 per kilo for pangolin, what restaurants in Vietnam charge. \"Wow! That's a very fantastic price!\" he said. Then he thought about it. \"I think that's unfair.\"\n\nMy thinking about pangolins got caught in a loop after visiting the hunting village of Ketenong. Is better enforcement of the law the solution? I didn't like the idea of cops arresting people like Ropi and Ruslan, the men in the food chain with the least to gain, although I did hear that the threat of arrest is an effective deterrent. Enforcement should focus primarily on the international networks \u2013 on breaking down the barriers that insulate the real players in this trade from arrest. Part of that means rooting out corruption. Part of it means hiring more people to patrol the forest. Rangers I met told me their numbers in Sumatra are ridiculously inadequate to protect wildlife here. But what about other solutions? Education? It seems like a hard sell to think that explaining to people why pangolins are important -- something I have enough difficulty articulating after nearly two weeks of talking about them -- would suddenly change the minds of big-boss wildlife traffickers or ground-level poachers. At least that was my skeptical view before I met a man named Suryatin. Suryatin has managed almost singlehandedly to turn a village of pangolin hunters into pangolin protectors. And he's done it by gently coaxing people to Do the Right Thing by supplying them with better information about pangolins. \"If the forest is destroyed, life is also destroyed,\" he told me. \"Enforcement isn't effective out here. People need to know why you're not allowed to hunt pangolin,\" he continued, before offering the most concrete ecological argument for the pangolin's importance I'd heard. \"Next door is a rubber plantation. Sometimes the ants eat the rubber trees. Why that happens is because there are no more pangolins -- so because of that, I try to convince people to let the pangolins live. \"Letting the pangolins live can help the rubber trees survive.\" Where was this guy two weeks ago? It's not just about the rubber trees, of course. Suryatin, 63, and the 1,260-person town's mayor, Yendra, actually buy pangolins back from poachers if they see them leaving town to sell to a collector. They pay full market price, he told me, or about $22, because he cares that much about pangolins -- and because he sees it as a teaching moment. He takes the opportunity to explain to the would-be poacher that pangolins are unique and valuable -- a cornerstone of the local ecosystem, and that many industries would unravel without it. \"I just talk about why I care about wildlife and pangolins,\" he said, as if that's the simplest and most why-didn't-you-know-that solution ever. \"People who buy the pangolins don't understand the benefits of the pangolins for nature.\" It's working, but not for exactly the reasons he thinks. I met one former pangolin hunter, Zainal Abidin, 54, who had one of these confrontations with Suryatin. He used to track pangolins by sound -- listening for the CRRRUK CRRRUCK CRRRUK of their scaly tails rattling against the tree branches -- before spotting them with a flashlight and, sometimes, clubbing them on the head. He told me he heard Suryatin's arguments about the pangolin's ecological value, and he understood. \"Pangolins are interesting animals,\" he said. \"Pangolins are just like humans; if the pangolin goes extinct it will affect the humans, too.\" But there were other factors in his decision to stop poaching: He is getting older, for one, and hunting pangolin is hard. Jail time is part of it, too. But he also found another job. When the economic incentive to hunt went away, it was no longer a consideration. Education is an important part of the solution, but people also need jobs. That's certainly something Suryatin can understand. He got on this enviro kick several years ago when he received training from World Wildlife Fund, to start a tree nursery to help in reforestation efforts. He's done very well for himself, planting 5 million trees since 2003, he told me. He ended up buying the land across from his greenhouse because it's home to an enormous \"root tree\" where pangolins are known to nest, and where people used to hunt them. If he owned the land, he thought, he could stop the poaching. Ropi, a 29-year-old in Sumatra, Indonesia, said he has hunted pangolins to feed his kids; not to get rich. John Sutter/CNN The root tree is a sight -- a tangle of vines that's easily three stories tall and as wide as a small house. Think of the tree from \"Avatar\" or something out of \"Fern Gully.\" It's that spectacular. Suryatin calls it -- and I'm not kidding -- \"The Tree of Life.\"\n\nI had no idea I would meet Suryatin when I traveled out to his village, which is called Karang Panggung and is the closest thing I can imagine to a Sumatran enviro-utopia. I thought I was traveling there to go on another pangolin hunt. But that's not happening here anymore -- not much at least. I talked with several people who expressed Suryatin's enthusiasm for nature. And I kind of fell in love with the place. I spent part of an afternoon taking photos with kids who were playing volleyball. They practiced their English on me: \"Good morning I love you!\" Almost every home seems to have potted trees out front, because many residents are helping in reforestation efforts. So, instead of going on a pangolin hunt on my last night in Sumatra, I decided to take several people from the village with me to the Tree of Life. I hoped we could see a pangolin in the wild. Headlamps and flashlights in tow, we walked over to the tree around 8:30 p.m. I asked one of my companions what other animals we might find out here. \"Oh, tigers and leopards,\" he said. \"You can see leopards in the secondary forest like this.\" Great, I thought. Tigers by dark. The first hour was marked with lots of activity. One man climbed at least 20 or 30 feet into the tree to look for a pangolin that turned out, fittingly, to be a chameleon, the master of disguise. Some of us paced circles around the tree. Others walked the nearby forest, panning our lights like prison wardens. At one point, there was a faint light moving among the roots. A pangolin eye? Nope, lightning bug. Around 10 p.m., we decided to have a seat and wait. \"Everyone turn off your flashlights,\" said Q, who still was traveling with me. \"Let's try being silent.\" The next hour and a half was one of the most magical periods of my trip to Southeast Asia. I looked around, checking for pangolins and leopards, then lay down on my back and listened. The jungle will play music for you if you let it. An owl hooted on the upbeats; birds in the distance sounded like they were shooting lasers in video games; frogs squeaked like chew toys; and something behind my right ear sounded roughly like a car with an ignition struggling to fire. (Please be a tiger. Don't be a tiger.) The longer we were quiet, the more layers of sound revealed themselves. Sumatra is home to incredible plants and animals -- to elephants, rhinos, orangutans and the largest known flower in the world, Rafflesia arnoldii, with a bloom 3 feet across. All of those icons of nature are featured on national park brochures and Wikipedia pages. But in the echoing silence of that night, I was reminded of why the diversity of life matters. The insect string section. The faint WHOOP WHOOP of the gibbon. All of them are needed for the song to continue. We've discovered and named perhaps 10% of the species that exist on this incredible planet, according to Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson. The unknowns are mostly the little guys -- the fungi, bugs and microbes. For me, the personal list of \"unknowns\" included the pangolin. It was new to me at the start of my journey. Who doesn't want to live in a world where those discoveries are possible -- where the planet is full of possibility and wonder? The alternative is awful: Knowing that we live in a place that is continually getting less diverse, less interesting, less capable of supplying humanity with scientific discoveries and medicines and better/stronger materials. And, most importantly, less capable of supporting life. The planet, like the pangolin, is surprisingly fickle. \"As extinction spreads, some of the lost forms prove to be keystone species, whose disappearance brings down other species and triggers a ripple effect,\" Wilson wrote in his 1992 book, \"The Diversity of Life.\" \"The loss of a keystone species is like a drill accidentally striking a power line. It causes lights to go out all over.\" Perhaps that could be the case with pangolins. Too little is known to be certain. 7 ways to help save the pangolin A group in Vietnam will make a pangolin public service announcement if it raises $5,000 from CNN readers. Read full story \u00bb But everything in the natural world is connected. All of it matters. As one wildlife crime expert, Crawford Allan, put it to me: What's the point of saving Mona Lisa's smile if the rest of the painting is gone? That's the perfect metaphor for what's happening with the wildlife trade. Advocates have become so focused on nature's celebs -- the rhinos, the elephants, the tigers -- that they've neglected the bigger picture. It's easy to ignore a species like the pangolin. But we do so at our peril. At first, lying there on the ground, I was telepathically willing a pangolin to emerge from the dark. Come on pangolin -- this would be the perfect way to end this story. Us meeting out here in the wild, under the \"Tree of Life\" no less. I need an ending here! But the more we waited, the more at peace I was with the idea that I likely never will see a pangolin in the wild. Right then, under the tree, that seemed perfect. Not just OK, but better. I knew from what Suyratin and the others had told me that at least two pangolins actually do live in the tree. If they're smart enough to hide from us, they're probably better off than the pangolins in Vietnam, whose developed need for attention has cost them their freedom. These pangolins are wise -- and they're lucky. They live in a village where, even if they did present themselves, they would be protected. People here realize the world is a better place with the pangolin -- a little stranger, a little more wonderful. They're protected because they're understood. That's the best the lowly pangolin can hope for. And that's actually quite a lot.",

    "text": "Last November, to give the topic a generationally specific space, Ms. Soffer and Gabrielle Birkner, 34, started Modern Loss, a website geared to people around their age to address many permutations of loss, from miscarriages to a parent\u2019s death. Both women have confronted the latter: Four years before Ms. Soffer\u2019s father\u2019s heart attack, her mother was killed in a car accident. And in 2004, Ms. Birkner\u2019s father and stepmother were murdered at their home in Sedona, Ariz., by a methamphetamine addict.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Soffer and Ms. Birkner found the emotional and psychological support resources for people in their early adult life-stage lacking. \u201cI went to a family of homicide victims support group run through Safe Horizons in a church basement in Harlem when I was living on the Upper West Side and there was no one in my generation,\u201d said Ms. Birkner, a Brooklyn-based writer and editor. \u201cStill, it did save my life.\u201d Ms. Soffer said she was the only person under 65 at the grief support groups she joined, adding that among those her own age, \u201cI barely know anyone who had lost both their parents.\u201d\n\nFor a generation known for broadcasting internal monologue across the Internet, some of its members seem eager for spaces to express not just the good stuff that litters everyone\u2019s Facebook newsfeed, but also the painful. In November, Melissa Lafsky Wall, 35, the founder of New York-based Brick Wall Media, turned to Modern Loss after a miscarriage, posting an essay called \u201cThe Silent Sorrow.\u201d \u201cThe Internet should speak to the parts of life that we all experience, but aren\u2019t represented in most media, a large one being grief and loss,\u201d Ms. Wall said, adding that the feedback she got was all positive, which she attributes to the site. \u201cIf you are going to write about your miscarriage on Reddit, for instance, it\u2019s going to be a very different community.\u201d\n\nModern Loss is a repository of essays, resources and advice that the founders try to edit so that it doesn\u2019t sound glib, overly religious or trite. For instance, you\u2019ll never hear, \u201cAt least they are in a better place.\u201d (\u201cOur least favorite line ever,\u201d Ms. Soffer said.) The website also examines decidedly 21st century topics like what to do when Gmail keeps suggesting someone who has died as a contact, a topic that Esther D. Kustanowitz, the founder of the blog My Urban Kvetch, explored in a post called \u201cDeleting My Mother.\u201d Befitting the target audience, it is not overly earnest. \u201cStay tuned for upcoming Modern Loss events in real life,\u201d the site\u2019s \u201cabout us\u201d page says. \u201cBecause misery loves company, and nachos. And margaritas.\u201d\n\nMs. Soffer, a former producer at \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d said of the site, \u201cYou have to have a sense of humor.\u201d\n\nAnother mourning site speaking to the younger generation is Lisa Frank Mixtape, promising \u201c90s Music, 21st Century Grief.\u201d Its founder, Zoe Feldman, 29, solicits essays about human loss (sorry, no pets), sending her contributors a mix tape in return for submitting an essay about a human loss they have experienced. Named after the company Lisa Frank, known for its brightly colored products that Ms. Feldman said are to her the antithesis of grief, the venture was inspired after her former girlfriend and Smith College classmate, Rebecca Rosenthal, known as Becca, died in October 2012 at age 27.\n\n\u201cI went to a Shaman, a healer and every psychiatrist in Manhattan, and the only thing that helped me was talking to people my age who had experienced some devastating loss,\u201d said Ms. Feldman, who works on business strategy for PepsiCo in New York and has mailed around 50 mixtape cassettes (she will burn a CD for those who don\u2019t have a tape player). \u201cOne person wrote and said it\u2019s like being part of a weird, sad tribe,\u201d she said.\n\nThose who are accustomed to social media as a way to tout how fabulous your life is, beware: these sites can be unflinchingly graphic and wrenching. In November, K. H. (submitters use their initials on Lisa Frank Mixtape) wrote, \u201cMy dad passed away on May 31, 2003 in my arms as I tried to give him CPR.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Doughty, the author of a forthcoming book \u201cSmoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons From the Crematory,\u201d to be published by W. W. Norton in September, said she is seeing a cultural shift happening around what she calls \u201cdeath awareness.\u201d Her peers are engaging in more-open and public discussions about mortality and loss, a movement of which her \u201cAsk a Mortician\u201d channel on YouTube is on the frontier.\n\nToday\u2019s Headlines Wake up each morning to the day\u2019s top news, analysis and opinion delivered to your inbox.

On Ms. Doughty\u2019s blog, contributors discuss issues like, \u201cWhat do dead bodies really look like?\u201d and \u201cSuicide is the cause of death. Do you share?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cGirls,\u201d the HBO show about young people making their way in modern-day Brooklyn, has twice tackled the issue of grief and death this season, first when Hannah Horvath\u2019s e-book editor, David, is found dead in the Hudson River. \u201cDo you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?\u201d Ms. Horvath asks her editor\u2019s widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)\n\nThe show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual, and therefore more fraught. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you mourning quietly?\u201d asks Adam, Hannah\u2019s boyfriend, after she reads him a part of her editor\u2019s obituary on Gawker, which in real life has a tag called \u201cAnd Now They\u2019re Dead.\u201d Twitter responses to death, like the hashtag RIP, which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer L\u2019Wren Scott\u2019s suicide, can also seem more like display than distress.\n\nMs. Birkner, a former obituary writer, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the nature of social media, generally, to react thoughtfully to things and think, \u2018How can I really help?\u2019 It would be great if everyone said, \u2018Can I buy your groceries, or can I start a meal train?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast February, on what would have been Ms. Rosenthal\u2019s 28th birthday, Ms. Feldman found a long post on her dead friend\u2019s Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms. Rosenthal had died. \u201cA lot of what she wrote wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. \u201cBecca\u2019s mother was so upset, and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management.\u201d Ms. Feldman\u2019s explanation for that kind of behavior is \u201cperformative grief,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the only excuse I can think of. The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, \u2018look at me\u2019 behavior.\u201d On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, \u201d said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.\n\nThen there\u2019s the lingua franca of social media \u2014 the like button \u2014 that\u2019s totally discordant with death. \u201cMy God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing \u2018136 people like this\u2019 underneath?\u201d Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a \u201csympathize button,\u201d something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company. (Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, but allows friends and family, depending on privacy setting, to leave posts on the timeline.)\n\nThe fact that the Internet is perhaps not the best channel for grief (with gaffes immortalized in cyberspace) is why David Fajgenbaum, 28, the founder of National Students of AMF, a support network for college students with sick or deceased parents, said his organization of 40 chapters on campuses has been cautious about integrating an online component. \u201cSomeone could say the wrong thing online, and could really hurt someone,\u201d said Mr. Fajgenbaum, who started the support group in his mother\u2019s memory while an undergraduate at Georgetown.\n\nMiss Manners, a.k.a. Judith Martin, writes rather unequivocally on the matter. \u201cLetters of condolence should be written by hand,\u201d she said. \u201cBurdensome as it may be, it offers the comfort of knowing that one is representing the deceased to those who cared about him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut as Mr. Fajgenbaum acknowledged, young people are eager for that virtual connection; after all, technology and the Internet are a ubiquitous part of their existence. That\u2019s what Jason Feifer, 33, creator of the instantly viral Tumblr \u201cSelfies at Funerals,\u201d discovered when he posted a few dozen photos of teenagers taking pictures of themselves at funerals. In doing so, Mr. Feifer, an editor at Fast Company magazine, said he was documenting a newfangled mourning practice. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the older generation to see more than disrespect and to see some kind of genuine communication,\u201d he said.\n\nAdmittedly, though, some of the images made him cringe, in particular the young woman who wrote: \u201cLove my hair today. Hate why I\u2019m dressed up #funeral.\u201d\n\nMr. Feifer said, \u201cI think there are a lot of kids who saw this Tumblr and will not take a selfie at a funeral, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the kids who did take these photos don\u2019t know how to grieve.\u201d",

But there's a big difference between tinkering with the past or future once and getting away with it -- as in a movie like \"The Terminator\" -- and making a weekly habit of it.\n\nTwo reasonably interesting new series explore the topic premiering the same week: NBC's \"Timeless\" and CW's \"Frequency.\" The latter network's \"The Flash\" also continues to muck around in what-if and alternate-universe scenarios in its third-season debut, offering further evidence of how tricky this territory is to navigate.\n\n\"Timeless\" is perhaps the most direct contemplation of what's known as \"the butterfly effect,\" in which messing with time can have unforeseen consequences, large and small.\n\nPerhaps appropriately, the NBC drama dips into the way-back machine, recalling everything from the 1960s series \"The Time Tunnel\" to the movies \"Timecop\" and \"Terminator\" -- both of which, incidentally, became short-lived TV shows.\n\nHere, time travel becomes a kind of procedural, with a crack team dispatched into the past each week to thwart attempts to alter history.

    "text": "CNN is working together with Italy\u2019s Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) to educate young people across the country about human trafficking and modern-day slavery.\n\nA Memorandum of Understanding signed in Rome by Minister of Education Stefania Giannini and CNN Freedom Project Executive Editor Leif Coorlim agreed to incorporate the ground-breaking CNN Freedom Project into the Italian education system. Effective from this current year, CNN Freedom Project materials will be made available through the network of educational institutions across Italy.\n\nUnder the agreement \u2013 facilitated by CNN International Commercial and CNN Freedom Project supporter The Essam & Dalal Obaid Foundation (EDOF) \u2013 video material from CNN Freedom Project will be used to increase awareness about human trafficking and modern-day slavery among Italian students. The award-winning journalism \u2013 spanning reports, documentaries and digital content \u2013 will be used in classrooms to promote practical solutions to improving the care of people affected by such issues. Italian students will also be encouraged to join and contribute to the CNN Freedom Project\u2019s efforts.\n\nThis development is part of the Italian government\u2019s initiative to tackle such issues at a time when there is greater risk of human trafficking due to increased levels of migration across Europe. The initiative is the latest step in CNN\u2019s commitment to helping end modern-day slavery through the CNN Freedom Project.\n\nWith a remit to enact change, educate and advocate against human trafficking, CNN Freedom Project special reports and documentaries have been on CNN International since 2011. Since it was founded, CNN Freedom Project has provided documented evidence leading to the rescue of over 1,000 people worldwide, sparked over $24 million in donations to anti-trafficking organisations, changed laws and corporate policy and inspired NGOs and campaigns around the world. The project has won dozens of journalism and human rights awards, and the U.S. State Department last year honoured CNN International Executive Vice President and Managing Director Tony Maddox as a 2015 Trafficking in Persons Report Hero.\n\nLeif Coorlim, Executive Editor, CNN Freedom Project, said: \u201cThe CNN Freedom Project has told hundreds of stories across the globe, focusing on all types of modern-day slavery. In that time, we\u2019ve come to understand education as a key component to solving this problem. If young people are aware of the risks, they can avoid being trafficked. If they know the signs of trafficking, it may lead to identifying victims and saving lives. That\u2019s why this agreement is so important. We commend the Italian Ministry of Education for its forthright leadership in addressing this issue, and hope more school systems will follow its example.\u201d\n\nStefania Giannini, Minister of Education, said: \"Education is crucial to help solving the problem of all types of modern-day slavery. If young people know the signs of trafficking, it may help to identifying victims and saving lives. For this reason, knowing the commitment of the CNN Freedom Project on this issue, we launched a cooperation project between the Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) and CNN aimed at distributing CNN Freedom Project-created content as educational materials within Italian school to increase awareness about human trafficking and modern-day slavery and encouraging Italian students to join and/or contribute to the CNN Freedom Project\u2019s efforts. We are proud to be the first Ministry in the world to co-operate with the CNN Freedom Project in addressing this issue.\u201d\n\nCNN Freedom Project is supported by The Essam & Dalal Obaid Foundation (EDOF), which shares the same values of the initiative and has a commitment to pursue peace and remedy injustices in areas such as human trafficking. EDOF has supported CNN Freedom Project since March 2015 and collaborated with CNN on a number of initiatives including a high-profile special event at Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center that explored ways that elected officials, policymakers, law enforcement, activists and survivors can combat modern slavery.\n\nEnds\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\n\n\nDan Faulks\n\nVice President, Communications\n\nCNN International Commercial\n\nTel: + 44 20 7693 1362\n\nDan.Faulks@turner.com\n\nAbout CNN International\n\nCNN\u2019s portfolio of news and information services is available in seven different languages across all major TV, digital and mobile platforms reaching more than 420 million households around the globe.

    "text": "Could snapping photos of food help you eat healthier?\n\nThat's the promise of Snap It. Launched by digital health and weight-loss platform Lose It!, the new feature of an already existing app proposes a simple solution to those who struggle to keep track of their caloric intake: Take a photo of your food, and Snap It will immediately display its calorie count\n\nShowing people the caloric value of their foods before they eat them can help modify their eating habits. Some studies have shown that keeping a food journal helps people stick to their diet. And in an effort to fight rising obesity rates, the FDA announced in 2014 that chain restaurants throughout the U.S. will have to post calorie information in their menus (the rule is set to go into effect sometime next year).\n\nBut the FDA rules won't apply to all restaurants. And food diets are cumbersome, tending to go the way of new year's resolutions.\n\nLose it! thinks that Snap It could be the solution.\n\nBut right now Snap It, still in beta, needs some help figuring out what it's seeing. Snap It might be able to identify your roll of sushi as a roll of sushi, but it needs you to specify the type of rice, the type of fish, and any garnishes.\n\nRelated: Facebook, Google, Amazon create group to ease AI concerns\n\nCharles Teague, cofounder and CEO of Lose It!, likes to compare Snap It's trajectory to that of self-driving cars. \"Early autonomous vehicles are doing driver assist, like Tesla's auto pilot,\" Teague told CNNMoney in an interview, adding, \"you need to keep your hands on the wheel too.\"\n\nRight now, the technology behind Snap It limits it. Teague explained that the new feature relies on a neural network that classifies images -- in other words, artificial intelligence that can identify categories of photos.\n\nAt this point, Teague said, the technology is sophisticated enough to recognize an apple and classify it as such, but not smart enough to figure out the size, variety or other traits that affect the apple's caloric value.\n\nEventually, Teague believes the tech should be able to identify foods so well that it won't require any more data to calculate caloric information.\n\n\"We want to get to the point where you take the photo and let our intelligence do the work,\" he said.\n\nBut machine learning is tricky, as is counting calories. For Snap It to function as planned, it'll have to overcome some serious challenges.\n\nTake, for example, the difference between a meal with condiments and one without. Dr. Barbara Rolls, who serves as the Helen A. Guthrie Chair of Nutritional Sciences at Penn State, pointed out that modifying a recipe in a way that might not be visible in a photograph could significantly affect its calorie count.\n\n\"You could vary the proportions of fat and water and get standard portion variation of a couple hundred calories,\" she told CNNMoney.\n\nRelated: Robot pizza place introduces high-tech delivery trucks\n\nSnap It draws from a wide database that includes information from the FDA, food manufacturers, restaurants and others, but it might not be able to detect deviation from a standard recipe through a photo alone.\n\nThat doesn't mean Snap It can't be useful in its current form.\n\nAt this point, Rolls suggests dieters ask themselves a question when deciding whether to use products like Snap It: \"Is getting the wrong information better than using your senses?\" If you don't trust your senses, the answer may be yes.\n\nFor some, tools like Snap It can serve as a general guideline -- a way to get a sense of how many calories, on average, are in a plate of fries or a bowl of soup. But, Rolls says, it likely won't be an accurate way for people adhering to strict calorie-based diets to figure out if they've exceeded a limit, or reached a minimum.\n\nSo you can keep taking photos of your food. But when it comes to slimming down, you might want to trust your gut more than an app -- for now, anyway.",

They may not even realize it, but they've changed,\" Sears tells CNN's Sailing Success show.\n\n\"They have learned what only sailing can accomplish, which is better than anything I've ever encountered in my life -- sailing has the ability to convert fear into confidence and to create a sense of self-reliance that's kind of absent today.\n\n\"Kids today, they go to their cellphones every time there's a problem, but when you're out there in the middle of the ocean and a gale comes, you're in it and you have to make it happen so you can safely return to port.

Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nUltimate competition\n\nWhile the world's best sailors are taking cutting-edge yachts around the globe in preparation for their bid to claim the America's Cup -- Japan is the next stop in November -- Sears and crew are making their year-long trip in a grand vessel that echoes the very beginnings of the sport's ultimate competition.\n\nSears is the owner/operator of the 139-foot schooner America -- a replica of the boat that won the first America's Cup in 1851.\n\nIn April, it began a voyage that will conclude in Bermuda mid-2017, when the 35th edition of the oldest international sporting contest takes place.\n\nSears has more than 8,000 hours on the water under his belt, having started sailing as a nine-year-old after buying his first yacht with money earned from delivering newspapers. However, the four \"kids\" -- as he calls them -- had never gone offshore before this adventure.\n\n\"They're doing such a fantastic job, and they have developed so much courage out there,\" he says.\n\n\"They all come from such different walks of life, and yet on the boat we're just one big family.\"\n\nTroy Sears at the helm of America, with Chris Childers in support.\n\nInspiring\n\nChris Childers is the most experienced of the quartet. He teaches sailing in San Francisco, having overcome a car accident which resulted in his left leg being amputated below the knee.\n\n\"He doesn't let that affect anything he does on the boat or his state of mind,\" Sears says.\n\n\"He's taken a challenge and said, 'I'm going to move on in life and keep on going,' and that's also really inspiring.\"\n\nA New Jersey native, Childers was delighted when America dropped anchor in Manhattan for May's leg of the Louis Vuitton World Series -- the first time an America's Cup event had been held in New York since 1920.\n\n\"One thing I always tell my students out in California is that seeing your home from a different perspective is incredibly powerful, liberating and brings a whole new light to what you're living and doing,\" he tells CNN.\n\n\"Seeing New York from this perspective is one that I haven't before, so it was really, really neat.\"\n\nBrie Busey working on the deck of America.\n\nComing into the fog-shrouded harbor at 6.30 a.m. was also a new experience for Brie Busey, who grew up over 4,000 miles away in Anchorage, Alaska and had never before visited the Big Apple.\n\n\"I walked out on deck and saw the Statue of Liberty, so that was a pretty amazing entrance,\" she recalls. \"Wow, just wow.\"\n\n\"Brie has the most amount of courage on the boat of any of us, and I'm constantly having to remind her to tone it down,\" Sears adds. \"She's by far the strongest person on the boat. She has the strongest personality and the most confidence.\"\n\nSea puns\n\nIf Busey is providing the bravado, then Tasha Ellis keeps the crew's spirits buoyant.\n\n\"I hired her exclusively because she has an infectious smile and laughter, and that's so important to have,\" Sears says.\n\n\"She's responsible for attitude on the boat, and the more her personality can rub off on us, the better people we'll be.\"\n\nTasha Ellis keeps the crew entertained with her sense of humor.\n\nWhen bad weather struck during the 5,000-mile journey from San Diego to New York, even Ellis' enthusiasm was put to the test.\n\n\"The storms are the craziest part. First we saw small waves crashing onto the boat, then it started going crazy -- it was like the elements were out to get us!\" she says.\n\n\"It was really hot, then a couple of days later it was freezing, then raining and lightning. We cuddle, we sit in the cockpit and hold each other and hope the lightning will go away.\n\nEast coast friends will know a storm like this, but for my California friends: this beast was about 500 miles wide.

So it probably makes people a bit annoyed, but they're laughing so it's okay.\"\n\nAfter the lightning -- \"It was an incredible light show, it lasted for hours ... like I've never seen before,\" says Sears -- came a fierce gale initially undetected by the weather forecasters, then dense fog in the Ambrose Channel threatened to scupper their deadline for arriving in Manhattan.\n\n\"It really made me pause,\" Sears reflects. \"The original captain of America in 1851 was a pilot from New York Harbor, and it just showed what an incredible job they did in the mid-19th century dealing with the conditions out there.\n\n\"It's incredible they did it at all -- no GPS, nothing that would tell them where to go. And here we are in the middle of fog where you can't even see the bow of the boat in the middle of the night ...\"\n\n'Sweet, sweet relief'\n\nFor Cragan Smith, the adventure has been a big step up from sailing dinghies at college and high school. Before this, she had been working in a coffee shop.\n\n\"Being on the ocean is awesome,\" she says. \"I've never sailed on big boats before, so that's my favorite part -- learning.\"\n\nCragan Smith is \"a navy kid, so I grew up moving around.\"\n\nSears believes Smith, the daughter of a navy sailor now stationed in Washington D.C., has \"grown the most\" of the quartet.\n\n\"She had a lot of fear earlier but every day you can see how much she's growing in confidence as a person,\" he says.\n\nSmith describes arriving in New York as \"sweet, sweet relief\" after barely sleeping the previous 48 hours.\n\nThough the conditions have at times been dangerous, the seasoned Sears has experienced backup on board in the form of Mark Stevenson -- a former US Naval Academy graduate who flew jets on an aircraft carrier before studying for a PhD in physics and returning to navy work.\n\n\"If anything breaks on the boat, he can understand how to fix it, and that's a very valuable skill to have out in the middle of the ocean,\" he says of the San Diego native.\n\nSears descirbes his friend Mark Stevenson as a \"Mr. Fixit.\"\n\nStevenson adds: \"There's a sense of fulfillment, accomplishment, a sense of how men felt a thousand years ago when you do this kind of thing and bring a boat across the ocean.\n\n\"Most of it is just work -- you're trying to do a job and do it safely.\"\n\nDear USA, Happy 240th Birthday.

I find they enjoy hearing where the America's Cup intersects with history.\"\n\nThe original America was built to showcase US naval architecture at the first World's Fair in London, Sears says, at a time when relations with the UK were strained -- the White House was burned down by British troops in 1814.\n\nThe first series was held around the Isle of Wight, with America beating 15 entries from the host nation.\n\n\"Queen Victoria and Prince Albert came on board very publicly to congratulate the crew and make sure the press was there and reported it,\" Sears says.\n\n\"That was seen as a catalyst of improving relationships between England and the United States.\"\n\nGot back from Bermuda this morning.

    "text": "Carol Costello anchors the 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET edition of CNN's \"Newsroom\" each weekday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single.\n\nI did. And I do.\n\nRecently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want.\n\n\"I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom,\" 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. \"There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well.\"\n\nJackie Demate, also 21, agreed. \"I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe.\"\n\nCarol Costello\n\nAt first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, \"Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!\"\n\nJackie didn't blink. \"But, Europe!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy.\"\n\nBefore you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once . That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960.\n\nWhat a fine example my generation is! Not.\n\nStill, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29.\n\nReligious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction.\n\nA study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says: \"From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being.\" On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be \"more desirable marriage prospects.\"\n\nBingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt.\n\n\"Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt,\" Emily Crille told me. \"That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home.\"\n\nI felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable?\n\nPerhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right.\n\nScandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today : \"In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying.\"\n\nThe article also points out that \"Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth.\"\n\nIn an effort to understand the joys of \"sambo,\" the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n\"To put it short,\" he told us, \"marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation.\"\n\nWow.\n\nFifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, \"I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it.\"\n\nMaybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: \"The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities.\"\n\nMy Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, \"Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for.\"\n\nMarriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough.\n\nWhich brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point?\n\nIn the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with \"I dos\"?\n\nI don't know. But I would love to know if you do.\n\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.",

    "text": "BOSTON (CBS) \u2014 A retired Marine who lost all four limbs in combat in Afghanistan six years ago is recovering after getting a double arm transplant at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nSergeant John Peck, 31, is currently working to gain use of his new arms after his surgery.\n\n\u201cEvery day, it\u2019s a learning experience,\u201d he said at a press conference at Brigham and Women\u2019s Wednesday.\n\nAnd he says that he\u2019ll use the arms to fulfill his life-long dream of becoming a celebrity chef.\n\n\u201cMy dream job since I was 12 was to be a chef,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because of my donor\u2019s gift, I actually have a chance of doing this.\u201d\n\nIn August, Dr. Simon Talbot, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s, led a team of 60 surgeons, nurses, and technicians for that 14-hour bilateral arm transplant.\n\nDoctors expect it will take 9-12 months of rehabilitation.\n\nIt was the fourth surgery of its kind performed at the Boston hospital.\n\nThe new arms were from a donor who had died only 36 hours earlier.\n\nOn Wednesday, Peck thanked his deceased donor and their family, who will remain anonymous.\n\n\u201cEvery day I look down at our new arms, I will drive through the pain and never give up,\u201d he said. \u201cI will remember his selflessness and his gift until the day I die, and I will not take it for granted.\u201d\n\nHe also thanked his wife, Jessica, for helping him through his recovery.\n\n\u201cWithout you I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he told her during the press conference. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come so far so fast. I love you, and I will continue to love you, and I hope you will stand by my side until the day I die.\u201d\n\nHe said one of the best things about having arms again is that he can hold Jessica\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cOne day very soon, I\u2019ll be able to hold Jessica\u2019s hand and actually be able to feel it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that truly is a precious gift.\u201d\n\nPeck said he found out about the surgery while searching for information about leg transplants online.\n\n\u201cImmediately, I just started blowing up their email,\u201d he said.\n\nHe completed an extensive evaluation in 2014 to become eligible for the transplant. Dr. Talbott said the evaluation was long and complex, and took about a year.\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s a great candidate for a number of reasons,\u201d Dr. Talbott said. \u201cHe is young and enthusiastic \u2026 as you can see, he\u2019s really enthusiastic about his therapy.\u201d\n\nPeck is currently undergoing outpatient therapy at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. There, he\u2019s working on physical therapy, as well as re-learning simple tasks that many take for granted, like dressing, grooming, and brushing his teeth.\n\n\u201cLiterally, people have a dominant hand and the other\u2019s a helper hand,\u201d said Dr. David Crandell, medical director of the Amputee Program at Spaulding Rehabilitation Network. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s got two helper hands.\u201d\n\nWatch: Q&A With Brigham And Women\u2019s Arm Transplant Patient\n\nHis nerves have to grow down into his new arms and into his fingertips, a process that could take a year\u2013and one that can prove very painful.\n\nPeck said the pain was \u201ctremendous\u201d at first.\n\n\u201cThere was one night in the ICU, I believe it was the first night that I had a bad night, I believe the anesthesia was starting to wear off and I actually wanted to call Dr. Talbott and tell him to re-amputate my arms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a moment of weakness, but I\u2019ve overcome it.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019ll have to get used to using real arms instead of prosthetics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things with prosthetics that I can\u2019t do\u2014like circular doorknobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWith prosthetics, I couldn\u2019t feel temperature. I literally dipped my prosthetic hand into the grill, and was just like, it\u2019s not a big deal to me. Now, I can\u2019t do that, I actually have to wear an oven mitt.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s since moved off pain medication, and once he regains feeling, Peck said he plans on living his dream.\n\n\u201cI plan on going to culinary school, travelling to Paris and Italy to learn about their techniques, coming back, and competing on The Next Food Network Star, to hopefully hear Giada and Bobby Flay say, \u2018John Peck, you are the next Food Network Star,'\u201d he said.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about John\u2019s journey or donate, visit his Facebook page or fundraising website.\n\nWBZ NewsRadio 1030\u2019s Kim Tunnicliffe reports\n\n",

    "text": "(CNN) Sunday's Malaysian GP looks set to deliver a tale of two former world champions who have fallen on hard times.\n\nWhile Jenson Button will be looking back on a stellar career as he marks his 300th grand prix start, teammate Fernando Alonso will be looking forward as he starts from the very back of the 22-man Sepang grid.\n\nBack to front?\n\nPreparation has not been ideal. Alonso incurred a 30-place penalty for trialing an upgraded Honda power unit in practice Friday.\n\nBut what the Spaniard loses in qualifying position he may gain later in the season from a lighter engine block and redesigned exhaust aimed at boosting the power unit's efficiency.\n\n\"We knew these penalties would come,\" admitted Alonso, who was also dealt an engine-related penalty at Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps circuit last month.\n\n\"One of the best places [to trial a new power unit] was Spa because of the conditions of our engines at that point. The second best was maybe Malaysia because the weather could play a big factor in the race.\"\n\nWhile the big points may once again be beyond Alonso on Sunday, the two-time world champion has every reason to be confident, having made up 14 places to seventh in this scenario last time out.\n\nPit to Fernando: \"Absolutely Awesome Fernando. P7. You beat both Williams, a Ferrari & a Red Bull after an awful start to the weekend.\" \u2014 McLaren (@McLarenF1) August 28, 2016\n\nAnd he has pedigree in Malaysia, too.\n\n\"I've won this race three times before so I have happy memories,\" Alonso told reporters. \"The Malaysian Grand Prix is always a fun event and among the drivers' favorites on the calendar.\n\n\"We'll be aiming to continue the momentum from the past couple of races and get a strong result there again this year.\"\n\n300 Club\n\nBut even if neither is where they ought to be in the standings -- with an inferior car hampering the quest for serious points since 2015's reformulation of the McLaren Honda partnership -- both can nonetheless reflect on special F1 careers.\n\nSeven years on from his world championship triumph with Brawn GP, Button will become just the third man in history to reach 300 F1 starts.\n\nJUST WATCHED What's the magic formula for making it in F1?

He's now been performing at the top level since the turn of the millennium and, joining Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello in the 300 club, the Englishman admits he never expected to come so far.\n\n\"I remember when Rubens got to 300, it was unbelievable ... I was like, 'I'm never going to race for that long.' And here I am...\"\n\nButton may be coming to the end of the road now -- especially after he announced he'd take up an ambassadorial role with McLaren next season -- but that's not dampened his excitement going forward.\n\nThe 36-year-old calls the undulating Sepang circuit a \"modern classic ... one of those tracks that drivers enjoy going back to.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Button: 'My aim is to always get on the podium' Replay More Videos ...

    "text": "(CNN) If the 19th century belonged to iron and steel and the 20th century belonged to concrete, could timber be the building material of our age?\n\nThat is the question posed by architect Alison Brooks' \"The Smile,\" currently on display at the Chelsea College of Art and Design as part of this year's London Design Festival\n\nConstructed out of tulipwood, \"The Smile\" is a 34-meter long, 3.5-meter high (111.5 feet by 11.5 feet) rectangular tube that curves at both ends into a huge Cheshire cat grin. Viewers can wander through the hollowed interior, while holes in the walls cast light patterns across the floor.\n\nIt is the most complex structure ever to be made out of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and, as such, it is one of the most exciting installations at the UK's largest design festival.\n\n\"It's going to open up a whole new world of possibility,\" says Brooks. \"It reveals the possibility of buildings being completely fabricated in wood.\"\n\nThe secret of strong wood\n\nA collaboration with Arup and the American Hardwood Export Council, \"The Smile\" is an experimental building -- part pavilion, part sculpture -- designed to showcase the structural and spatial potential of a material that could transform the way architects and engineers approach timber construction.\n\n\"I think the potential of hardwood is yet to be discovered, it's the next step,\" Brooks says.\n\nTulipwood CLT is light but naturally strong, allowing the two ends of \"The Smile\" to soar into the sky.\n\n\"I think what's kind of amazing is how thin the walls and floor are,\" she adds. \"Tulipwood has a tight grain and a really rich variation in color. It has a lot of warmth.\"\n\nWhile steel and concrete have been used as structural materials in buildings for decades or even centuries, the use of timber has long been hampered by the fact that it did not come in panels large enough to be used in a building's fabric or structure, for instance in the core.\n\nThis issue has been resolved by the development of CLT.\n\n\"CLT is a really clever way of making very large panels from small trees,\" says Andrew Lawrence, timber specialist at Arup.\n\nThis is achieved by gluing planks together in layers. The planks in each layer are turned at right angles to the next in a crisscross effect.\n\n\"The Smile\" is made of just 12 panels manufactured by German CLT pioneers Zublin-Timber, and held together by screws.\n\nThe largest panel is 14 meters (46 feet) long and 4.5 meters (15 feet) wide, a size that can compete with precast concrete.\n\nA sustainable future\n\nTimber has other properties that make it attractive to engineers and architects. CLT lends itself to prefabrication, explains Lawrence, because it can be cut precisely in a factory and is easily assembled on site.\n\n\"A building of CLT is like a giant piece of flat-pack furniture. That's why the construction industry has fallen in love with it, because it's so easy to transport, crane and assemble,\" Lawrence says.\n\nThough CLT made from softwood such as spruce has been in use for some time, the full potential of hardwood has not been explored until now.\n\nPhotos: Timber and bamboo -- wooden buildings are branching out Wooden skyscrapers \u2013 This floating wooden pavilion is the Pavillion of Reflections in Zurich.

(WJZ) \u2014 The Maryland U.S. State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office has charged a man from Hyattsville with federal crime complaint in attempting to provide material support and resources to foreign terrorist organization, the Islamic State of of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n\nThe U.S. State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office says 24-year-old Nelash Mohamed Das, a legal permanent resident originally from Bangladesh, was charged attempting to provide material support to ISIL in a plan to kill a U.S. military member. The FBI became aware of Das through his postings on social media, and had him connect with an undercover source, who Das believed was a fellow ISIL supporter.\n\n\u201cMr. Das is suspected of having actually tried to identify US military members who he could attack here in Maryland, also that he traveled to Virginia to purchase ammunition to be used in the attack,\u201d U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein tells WJZ.\n\nIn January 2016, Das is reported to have tweeted a picture of an AK-47 assault rifle along with the words \u201cThis is more than just a gun. This is a ticket to Jannah.\u201d \u201cJannah\u201d is a reference to the Islamic concept of paradise.\n\nDas attended a Handgun Qualification License class and is reported to have practiced with firearms and submitted fingerprints to obtain a handgun permit.\n\nIn May 2016, the FBI connected with Das through an agent working undercover as a confidant. Das told the source about his plot to kill a member of the military who lived in Maryland. He also said he had interest in traveling overseas for ISIL and carrying out multiple killings, specifically on military officials.\n\nIn a meeting on September 11, 2016, Das confirmed that he was committed \u201c100%\u201d to conducting an attack and said \u201cthat\u2019s like my goal in life.\u201d\n\nFinally, on September 30, Das, along with the undercover FBI source, went in a car loaded with weapons and ammunition to the false address of a supposed target, but was ambushed by authorities and taken into custody by FBI agents.\n\nIt can be hard for authorities to pin-point which alleged ISIL-supporters to target online, with an endless range of online threats from real to fake, and mediums, from Twitter, to Facebook and Youtube.\n\n\u201cThis makes for a more complicated and challenging Homeland Security public safety environment,\u201d said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.\n\nWith others like Das lurking online, cybersecurity experts like Steve Taormino says \u201cNo longer are you looking for actions. But you\u2019re looking for perceived actions.\u201d\n\nThe FBI and cyber security experts have special software that can help them detect who to target for closer watch. \u201cThe software is actually created to do nothing but search for specific phrases that may lead to some type of terrorist act,\u201d said Taormino.\n\nDas faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nDas had an appearance in federal court Monday afternoon, and was ordered to be detained pending a detention hearing, scheduled for this Thursday.\n\nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook",

But now, 101 years since it first hosted the US national tournament, the site is enjoying something of a renaissance.\n\nThanks to the New York Empire, a new franchise in the World Team Tennis competition, famous names like McEnroe and Roddick are helping to revive the famous old venue.\n\nPhotos: Can tennis reign again in Queens?

It also staged the Davis Cup final 10 times, more than any other venue worldwide. The courts were originally all grass until 1974 when, in line with the global trend, there was a switch to clay.\n\n\"What made Forest Hills appealing to spectators of all economic brackets was that you could take the subway from New York and be there in no time flat,\" recalls Steve Flink , a journalist, commentator and lifelong tennis fanatic.\n\n\"You could drive from Connecticut, or Westchester, or Rhode Island,\" he tells CNN's Open Court show.\n\n\"I used to see players on that No. 7 train, heading out there as a young fan. There was something very special about that, kids about to go back to school but being able to end their summers with what was the great American championships. It had a great atmosphere in that way, of families and business people coming together.\"\n\nRemembering the 1974 US Open final between Billie Jean King and Evonne Goolagong, Flink says he had \"never seen a crowd more electrified by a women's tennis match, ever.\"\n\n\"There were fans sitting at courtside because there was such a big crowd that day,\" he says. \"They got really close to the action. Even if you were in the top row of the stands you felt like you were right on top of the match.\"\n\nWest Side Tennis Club moved to Forest Hills Stadium in 1912.\n\nThe intimacy of the Forest Hills Stadium made it such a special place to play tennis; it also, however, contributed to its decline.\n\n\"There was just a little fence that would separate the fans from the players, so you could get up close and personal,\" 1971 US Open champion Stan Smith told CNN.\n\n\"But when you look back and think of the concept of playing this grand slam event at this little venue -- it is not even conceivable. At Flushing Meadows they probably have four times as much space as they did at Forest Hills.\"\n\n'Gazing into the future'\n\nThe move to the nearby Flushing Meadows came with a touch of inevitability, but Flink says it also brought \"a sense of sadness\" to longtime Forest Hills patrons.\n\n\"To leave an elegant, private club setting to a public park facility? Some people weren't ready to embrace that,\" he explains. \"But I believe that the USTA leaders who brought about that change were smart because they were gazing into the future.\"\n\nArthur Ashe Stadium, now featuring a retractable roof, dwarfs the 14,000-seat stadium at Forest Hills.\n\nMaria Bueno, a tennis star of the 1950s and '60s , won four of her seven grand slam singles titles at Forest Hills.\n\n\"It was really very beautiful,\" the Brazilian told CNN. \"The clubhouse was beautiful, the courts were beautiful, and everything was great. But then it became too small to hold any tournaments there.\n\n\"We had a tea party atmosphere at Forest Hills. You have flowers, you have grass. But the US Open now is huge -- it's very, very nice too, but it's totally different. It's not a private club.\"\n\nA source of invention\n\nBueno paints a picture of a bygone age, when sports stars still traveled by public transport.\n\n\"When I won I got a huge trophy, so I put the trophy under my arm with my rackets and off I went on the subway back to downtown New York where we were staying. It was what we were used to.\"\n\nBillie Jean King was a pioneer in the quest for equal rights between men and women in tennis.\n\nQuaint as it may seem now, Forest Hills helped pioneer the evolution of tennis.\n\nIn 1927, seeding of players was introduced. In 1950, Althea Gibson became the first black player to compete in a tennis grand slam.\n\nIn 1970, after experimenting with table tennis-style scoring, tiebreaks were invented at Forest Hills -- \"the single most important innovation in the history of tennis,\" according to Flink.\n\nIn 1973, equal prize money was awarded to men and women for the first time. In 1975, floodlights were installed, meaning businessmen from New York could watch games after work.\n\nA new lease of life?\n\nIn recent years, Forest Hills Stadium has been renovated as a concert arena. Having hosted stars such as The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Jimi Hendrix, Diana Ross, and Bob Dylan in the 1960s and '70s, it wasn't until 2013 that its days as a music venue returned.\n\nBut Forest Hills made its name as an international tennis ground, and fans want it to return as such.\n\n\"There's been a lull, and most of us believe that there should be something very big at this facility,\" Flink says. \"Keep it at a distance from the US Open, but maybe in the spring put on a big event, men and women, something that has real stature, something that reflects the importance of the club and represents the history of the game.\"\n\nWorld Team Tennis , founded in 1973 by US tennis legend King, could be starting to fill the tennis-shaped hole at Forest Hills.\n\nA mixed-gender competition with an alternative five-game scoring system, it attracts some of tennis' biggest names.\n\nKing, who won four US Open titles at Forest Hills, brought in Patrick McEnroe -- brother of tennis legend John and a US Davis Cup-winning captain -- to head the New York Empire team.\n\nThe New York Empire team in action at Forest Hills in 2016.\n\nIts lineup includes former world No. 1 Andy Roddick, a regular in the competition even before his retirement from top-level tennis in 2012.\n\nChristina McHale is among those on the team roster still active on the pro circuit.\n\n\"It's so exciting,\" McHale told CNN. \"When I found out I was drafted into the team I was super pumped. There's so much history here. We've a lot of people coming out.\n\n\"I heard (Forest Hills) was very rundown and a few years ago they thought about knocking it down. Now it's looking so nice and I hope they continue to play WTT, that it continues to grow and people keep coming to watch.\"\n\n93 years ago today, the stadium at the West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills was christened with the Wightman Cup pic.twitter.com/jW1bIPfgZW \u2014 This Day In Tennis (@ThisDayInTennis) August 11, 2016\n\nMcEnroe is upbeat about the tennis-playing culture World Team Tennis is creating at Forest Hills.\n\n\"When you see these players get together -- we've got a couple of players from England, from Argentina, we've got a local American in Christina McHale -- everybody really pulls together as a team,\" he told CNN. \"The camaraderie and the passion of the players is great.\n\n\"We've had nice crowds and I think the club and its members have been happy to have us. I'll be back here. We've had some real hardcore fans come out and get behind the team. I'm hoping for bigger and better in 2017.\"\n\nIt may be a long way from the heady days of that Vilas-Connors final. The crowds are thinner, and the stakes not as high. But if tennis keeps being played, then maybe it won't be long until Flushing Meadows has a noisy neighbor to contend with.",

    "text": "CNN columnist John D. Sutter is reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the \"2 degrees\" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . He's jdsutter on Snapchat.\n\n(CNN) Update: This poll is now closed and the results are in: Readers selected food and meat's impact on climate change as the next topic for CNN's Two\u00b0 series. Thanks to everyone who voted! Sign up for the Two\u00b0 newsletter to get updates about that story and this series.\n\nPrevious story below:\n\nEvery story needs a villain -- and climate change is no exception.\n\nKnowing which countries and industries contribute to climate change, and in what proportions, is key to understanding how we can fix this problem and avoid 2 degrees Celsius of warming , which is what policymakers regard as the threshold for \"dangerous\" climate change.\n\nPlus, this story is complicated by the fact that nearly all of us -- certainly those reading this column on a mobile phone or computer -- contribute to climate change in some way.\n\nWe're all partly to blame.\n\nI'm going to be exploring this idea of \"climate villains\" for the next month or so, as part of CNN's Two\u00b0 series , which looks at that threshold for dangerous warming. That's the point at which some island nations are expected to be submerged , drought risks go up considerably and water availability goes down.\n\nI'd like your help in deciding which bad guys to target.\n\nBelow, you'll find a Facebook poll that lists four of my favorite climate villains, all of which came from your suggestions. Pick the one you find most interesting and I'll go out into the world to report on the winner. The poll closes at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, August 16.\n\nMEET THE CLIMATE CHANGE VILLAINS -- the people and industries whose actions researchers say are causing global warming.... Posted by CNN on Thursday, August 13, 2015\n\nBefore you vote, though, you should know some of the basics. In talking to people about climate change this year, I've found there is SO MUCH confusion about what's causing warming and why.\n\nI've met people -- smart people, reasonable people -- who think that climate change is caused by aerosols from hairspray (it isn't) or that it's just part of a natural warming cycle (it's not). Burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat, as well as chopping down rainforests, contributes to climate change.\n\nHere's a breakdown of global greenhouse gas emissions by sector, according to 2012 data synthesized by the World Resources Institute. This is kind of a \"blame\" chart.\n\nOn Wednesday, I asked people on Facebook to identify their preferred climate villains . Among the most interesting (and sometimes humorous) responses you submitted: dinosaurs (\"they turned into the oil that we want to get at, right?\"); millennials (\"It is always millennials' fault for everything ...\"); parents (\"the process of procreation ... results in increases in demand of the earth's resources and is the driving force for most of our planet's woes\"). I was mentioned by name (\"John Sutter. I bet he's double secret super villain. No doubt.\"), as was Willis Carrier , the guy who commercialized the modern air conditioner, and James Watt, who invented an efficient steam engine\n\nYou also identified more nebulous bad guys, like apathy, greed, ignorance and consumerism. Geography found its way into the mix, too. China, America and the \"3rd world\" all made your list.\n\nSome countries are more to blame than others, sure. But it turns out that the most industrialized countries -- the United States, European countries and, increasingly, China and India -- are among the biggest contributors to climate change, because they burn the most fossil fuels.\n\nHere's a list of the top 10 countries in terms of their overall contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions. This list is measured from 1850, the start of the Industrial Revolution, to 2012, and it's based on data synthesized by the World Resources Institute\n\nUnited States China Russia Germany United Kingdom Japan India France Canada Ukraine\n\nThose are the countries most responsible for the warming we're already seeing, as well as for much of the warming that we will seen in coming years. According to the World Bank, the atmosphere already has warmed 0.8 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times , and about 1.5 degrees of warming is already \"locked in\" to the atmospheric system because of how much carbon we've burned.\n\nRemember, 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is the danger mark.\n\nJUST WATCHED 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change 01:16\n\nFor context, here's a list of the top climate polluters today. They create about 70% of all current greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, according to the World Resources Institute\n\nChina United States European Union India Russia Indonesia Brazil Japan Canada Mexico\n\nAll of this data is a rough guide to help you vote. Each of the four topics you suggested for this poll is a worthy candidate. Our diets, our reliance on fossil fuel reserves, our willingness to turn precious forests into farms and our addiction to gas-burning cars and other dirty modes of transit -- all of these contribute to climate change. And each is worth exploring in depth.\n\nI don't want to play the blame game forever. I agree with those of you who said we need to move past finger-pointing and toward solutions. I do think, however, that by exploring who and what's causing climate change, we'll have a better sense of how to solve this urgent problem.\n\nSo, please vote. Tell your friends. And thank you for helping decide where I'll focus my energy.",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) A majority of Americans say relations between blacks and whites in the US have worsened under President Barack Obama, according to a new CNN/ORC poll .\n\nThe survey results come as an increasing number say discrimination against blacks is a very serious problem and concerns about bias in the criminal justice system remain widespread.\n\nOverall, 54% say relations between blacks and whites have gotten worse since Obama became president, including 57% of whites and 40% of blacks. That's up sharply compared with last June, when 43% said things had gotten worse shortly after a racially motivated shooting at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nA similar share, 52%, say the criminal justice system in the US favors whites over blacks, while 36% say it treats blacks and whites equally, down 6 points since February 2015.\n\nAbout three-quarters of blacks and one-half of whites feel the system favors whites. Whites are sharply split by education level on this question, with 62% of whites who hold college degrees saying the system favors whites over blacks vs. just 42% among whites who do not have college degrees. And urbanites are more apt to say the system is discriminatory than are suburban or rural Americans: 62% who live in urban areas say so, above the 53% of suburbanites and 38% of rural residents who say the same.\n\nThe share describing discrimination against blacks generally as a very serious problem has inched up from 37% last June to 42% now, a high point during Obama's time in office. Much of the recent shift comes among whites, 34% of whom now see it as a very serious problem, up from 28% last June. Among blacks, that figure has softened somewhat and remains starkly higher than the share among whites, 80% said it was a very serious problem in June 2015 and 73% say so now.\n\nFew Americans see their local police as prejudiced against blacks, but there are sharp differences by race and between those who live in urban areas vs. rural ones.\n\nNationwide, 18% say at least some of their local police are prejudiced against blacks. That climbs to 43% among blacks, and dips to 13% among whites. Among urbanites, 25% see at least some of their local police as prejudiced vs. just 10% among those who live in rural areas.\n\nIn general, Americans have broadly favorable opinions of their local police, 86% view them favorably, 10% unfavorably, with blacks and other non-whites a bit less likely to hold a favorable opinion (91% of whites have a favorable view, 77% of all non-whites, and 69% of blacks feel the same).\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged after several incidents in the last few years in which unarmed black people were harmed or killed at the hands of police, holds a narrowly net-positive favorability rating: 44% view it favorably, 40% unfavorably, and 16% have never heard of the movement or don't know how they feel about it.\n\nAwareness of the movement has grown since last summer, when 33% had no opinion or had never heard of it.\n\nAmong blacks, 78% have a favorable view of the movement, higher than the 38% of whites who feel the same. There's a sharp divide among whites by education level in perceptions of Black Lives Matter, with 50% of whites who hold college degrees saying they see it favorably vs. 32% among whites without college degrees.\n\nTwo-thirds of adults say that peaceful protests are justified in response to those recent incidents where blacks where harmed or killed by police, and 14% overall, including about one-quarter of blacks, consider violent protests in response justified.\n\nIn findings from the same poll released earlier this week, voters were about evenly split between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on who would do a better job handling the criminal justice system. About 48% said Clinton would do the better job and 46% said they preferred Trump's approach.\n\nAmong whites, Trump held an edge 49% to 42% while blacks favored Clinton's approach 85% to 11%. Overall, Clinton held a wide advantage on improving the lives of racial minorities, 60% to 32% who thought Trump would be better on that score.\n\nThe CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 28 through October 2 among a random national sample of 1,501 adults, including 1,086 non-Hispanic whites and 140 non-Hispanic blacks. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among the full sample, 3 points for results among whites and 8.5 points for results among blacks.",

The rise of the voluntarily single woman has been happening in Western societies slowly, over time, concomitant with well-paying jobs, legal protection from economic or physical abuse, reliable birth control and the possibility of fulfilling careers and adventures.\n\nWomen are marrying at a later age these days, cohabiting with their partners or going in and out of short-term relationships without ever walking down the aisle.\n\nCurrently, 53% of women over 18 are in the singles column. Put another way, women now have choices that allow them to customize the arc of their lives and some of them find that it is best for them to put marriage aside.\n\nIs this natural? Is this bad? Is this cause for alarm?\n\nWe have long counted on women's sacrifices and the compromises they've made to lift societies all over the world. We are worried that if women delay or forgo marriage, the all-important family unit will suffer.\n\nAs much as I admire happy couples and families, I think this may be one of the few times in history when so many women could choose from such a full range of life choices without penalty or stigma. Since few people \"have it all,\" why not choose being single if that's the best option?\n\nWhat it comes down to is people get married when it's a good deal. The question is why isn't marriage a good deal anymore? Here are some considerations.\n\n1. A useless husband\n\nIf a woman is poor and only meets equally poor or poorer men, she's in a tough spot. It is no secret that many women do not choose to marry if the available partners will make their economic situation worse.\n\nIn some of these cases, even if a woman has a child, she may be better off with government help than a nonworking, noninvolved husband.\n\n2. Success changes everything\n\nWhen a woman is very privileged or highly successful, marriage could come very easily -- or not. Think of the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times. Or Oprah Winfrey, who for personal or professional reasons, is not married.\n\nMoreover, a woman doesn't need a husband who is a high-powered corporate attorney if she is a high-powered corporate attorney. Taking advantage of economic and professional opportunities could be undermined by committing to a partner with an equally ambitious, or different, life agenda. This kind of woman may wake up every day to new and exciting challenges and think, \"best to wait.\"\n\n3. Unwilling to make traditional compromises\n\nA woman who doesn't want to settle for cooking and cleaning and being the primary parent that society prefers. She is not meeting guys who want the kind of woman she is.\n\n4. The marriage penalty tax\n\nSome women are in an income bracket where marriage inflicts economic costs. She would have to pay more taxes if she marries someone who earns approximately what she makes or more.\n\n5. Avoiding cheating men\n\nA few years ago when I was in China, I had a conversation with some very beautiful female Chinese TV personalities about their personal life. I asked them why they were single and if they wanted to get married.\n\nThe three women all said they didn't want to marry because \"the men of our class will all expect to have mistresses, and it is better not to marry than have to put up with that.\" I have no idea if this was an exaggeration or not -- but they believed it.\n\n6. Waiting for the \"one\"\n\nThese women wait for the perfect guy, or the guy who they would fall in love with and love them back just as much. If that man doesn't come along, they prefer to go alone. As women get pickier, more factors enter into the marriage equation.\n\nThey may find someone who doesn't quite go the distance even after years of dating. They cohabit with someone and it doesn't work out. Singlehood, never intentional, becomes a fact. But they will not marry just to marry as their mothers or grandmothers might have.\n\nIn social psychology, there is a classic theory called \"exchange theory.\" It is a bit cold-blooded, but it predicts that a person's actions will be based on trying to find a balance of give and get. Each person's resources -- of all kinds, including money, looks, background -- are traded back and forth for a \"good deal.\" For example, a \"good deal\" scenario could be a woman who makes an excellent living pairing up with a man who is a writer and is willing to work at home and be the primary child care person.\n\nWhen women's life choices were highly constrained, they had little negotiating power. They had to marry or were seen as damaged. A few got away with being \"free spirits\" but usually they were exceptional in wealth or lineage -- and even so, it wasn't easy.\n\nIt's different now. While most women still want marriage, they don't want it at just any price. They don't want it if it scuttles their dreams. Marriage is not dead -- not by a long shot. It is still, to most of us, the house we wish to build for our love, our lover and our children.\n\nBut women want to craft a life instead of having it pressed upon them. And that means some of us will be single for a long time, and some of us will be single for life.\n\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\n\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion",

Photographer Arthur Grace struck up a friendship with Williams while capturing him for a 1986 Newsweek cover story, and from there the pictures -- for work, for the star, for whatever -- kept coming. Grace has compiled 190 of those photos for a book, \"Robin Williams: A Singular Portrait 1986-2002.\" Here, Grace shows Williams with the entertainer's daughter, Zelda, and Williams' then-wife, Marsha, in 1989.

    "text": "(CNN) CNN Opinion commentators share their thoughts in real time on the one and only debate between vice presidential candidates, Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democrat, and Gov. Mike Pence, the Republican:\n\nCommentary from Tim Naftali\n\nGovernor Pence won the debate by pretending that his running mate was Ronald Reagan. He will suffer from the fact checking tomorrow, but most Americans may not notice or care. A frustrating night for Tim Kaine, who thought there might be a chance for real engagement. The good news for Clinton/Kaine is that this night's contest matters more for 2020 than 2016.\n\nTim Naftali is a CNN presidential historian. He teaches history and public service at New York University and was the former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nKaine won, but the race is in the same place it was 2 hours ago. A close national race with a large electoral advantage for Clinton\n\nIf the point of debate was to support their Presidential candidates, @timkaine served #Hillary better than #Pence served #Trump . VPDebate\n\nIt turns out, if you refuse to acknowledge any of the horrible things that Donald Trump has actually said, it's pretty easy to defend him.\n\nWe saw sides of both VP candidates not yet seen. So much for the \"Mr. Nice guy\" routines. Much more contentious than expected. #VPDebate\n\nI have to say that @gop release that dropped too early was a bit prescient #VPDebate\n\nThere is no question that, for viewers, Pence won this debate. Which is baffling, considering he lied every damn second!!! Argh. #VPDebate\n\nKaine had a plan for this debate and he has executed relentlessly with a smile and the Clinton Campaign is better off for it\n\nThis is the essence of the Trump-Pence argument; and in an insider v. outsider race, probably a good contrast for them https://t.co/IiuRyjUfPd\n\nI understand having a faith-based objection to abortion. But I do not understand not upholding the laws of the nation you serve #VPDebate\n\nKaine making a profound point here \u2014 that in America, a public servant should not let her/his own religious views restrict rights of others\n\nMike Pence believes in the sanctity of life. Unless it's Muslim life, black life, Latino life, or a woman's life.\n\nSo @timkaine 's best, least-caffeinated moment came with 5 minutes left in the debate, when he talked (calmly) about his faith. #VPDebate\n\nPence gives great indictment of Clinton Foundation corruption & Kaine comes right back w/Trump's foundation problems. Draw. #VPDebate\n\n. @mike_pence doing a service here for @realDonaldTrump in recasting his bromance w/Putin as something Trump has never suggested. #VPDebate\n\nI finally figured it out: when Pence shakes his head and laughs it means he, too, is astonished about the outrageous things Trump has said.\n\nSpeaking of insults, this is the right forum to ask Pence about his bigoted stances on LGBT issues. #VPDebate https://t.co/XvKFsoTwUn\n\nThis election is the alternative reality of Washington, D.C. versus Reality TV. It is the season finale of American civilization #VPDebate\n\nMike Pence stays positive while Tim Kaine continually goes negative. Voters want solutions not insults. #VPDebate\n\nCommentary from Ruth Ben-Ghiat\n\nPence was brought on the ticket as the link to mainstream GOP politics. And in fact he perfectly expresses the core folly and failing of the GOP's leadership: their denial of what they have unleashed in America by nominating Trump. Pence denies the insults, the racism, the admiration for dictators, acting as though Kaine is saying \"ridiculous\" things by even raising them. He is there to soothe the conscience of Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain and all other GOP leaders who refuse to retract their endorsement of this rogue individual, no matter what he says or does.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University.\n\nTrump has no integrity on Putin or controlling Russia. That's unfortunate because the US will have to contend with Russia #VPDebate \u2014 RoxanneJones (@iamroxannejones) October 5, 2016\n\nPence brings up Ronald Reagan's positions, to avoid defending Trump... the guy running for President now. #VPDebate \u2014 Nayyera Haq (@nayyeroar) October 5, 2016\n\nCommentary from Timothy Stanley\n\nIn another year, Mike Pence would've been considered a risky choice for a Republican ticket -- being a very conservative governor. This year he brings maturity to the debate. So marked is the contrast with Trump that Pence's assured performance might reassure voters that Trump is outrageous but he knows how to hire well.\n\nKaine is punchy and making some good points, but many viewers will simply be distracted by Pence's relative smoothness. That said, Kaine's gag that Trump has a \"personal Mount Rushmore\" of Putin, Saddam, Gaddafi and Kim Jung-il was brilliant.

He appeals to those conservatives who have been dissatisfied with Trump, by demonstrating both good temperament and familiarity with policy. His answers sound surprisingly normal compared to those given by his running mate at the first debate last week. Tim Kaine, on the other hand, seems to be content to take the Donald Trump approach to debating -- interrupting, hectoring, and insulting. Pence's performance tonight will make some wonder why he's not the one at the top of the ticket.\n\nLanhee J.

Not for any specific party, just asking people if they were registered to vote and handing out forms. Indiana was my state. At one door, a teenage girl answered the door, saw my brown face and whispered: \"Please get off my porch. If my daddy sees you he might shoot.\" She was trying to warn me and looked slightly ashamed. Luckily, I had an older white woman with me, we were partners. We both left immediately.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his\n\n(CNN) Once again during \u202aMonday night's presidential debate, Donald Trump -- a man with zero law-enforcement experience -- misled the American people about crime in New York City. According to Trump, the overuse of stop-and-frisk policing is what made New York City the safest city in America.\n\nHe couldn't be more wrong.\n\nBill de Blasio\n\nHere in the safest large metropolis in the United States, where the greatest police force on the planet has been driving down crime for decades, we know better than Trump. We have actual facts about crime and they are clear: When we ended the overuse of stop-and-frisk more than two years ago, crime continued to go down.\n\nWith stop-and-frisk down nearly 97% from its high point in 2011, crime in New York City is now at record lows. Shootings are down. Murders are down. Serious felony crime is down. We're taking more guns off the street, our officers are safer than ever and there are fewer civilian complaints about their work.\n\nExcessive stop-and-frisk divides communities. That's why the New York City Police Department has moved away from it. Under our new Police Commissioner, James O'Neill, we're investing in real neighborhood policing. It will bring cops and communities closer together and make everyone safer.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) Seventeen alleged members of a global trafficking ring have been charged with transporting hundreds of women from Thailand to the United States for commercial sex purposes.\n\nAn indictment unsealed this week accuses the 12 Thai nationals and five Americans of recruiting the women in a sophisticated scheme that dates back to 2009.\n\nThey used fraudulent means to obtain visas for the women's relocation to major cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Department of Justice alleges.\n\n'Forced to work long hours'\n\nIn Minneapolis, their alleged activities raised red flags.\n\n\"Once in the United States, victims were allegedly placed in houses of prostitution, where they were forced to work long hours -- often all day, every day,\" the Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nJUST WATCHED State Department releases human trafficking report Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH State Department releases human trafficking report 04:24\n\n\"The women were not allowed to leave the prostitution houses unless accompanied by a member of the criminal organization.\"\n\nIn Minneapolis, authorities started investigating after they noticed Thai women getting transported to hotels and apartments all over the city, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nFederal authorities got involved, leading to the arrests and charges Wednesday. Suspects came from all over the US, including Georgia, Minnesota, Illinois and California.\n\n\"The 17 people charged in this indictment ran a highly sophisticated sex trafficking scheme,\" said US Attorney Andrew Luger of the District of Minnesota.\n\n\"They promised women in Thailand a chance at the American dream, but instead exploited them, coerced them and forced them to live a nightmare. In short, the victims lived like modern day sex slaves.\"\n\nCharges against the suspects include conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, coercion, forced labor, money laundering and visa fraud.\n\nPromises of a good life\n\nTo lure the women out of Thailand, recruiters allegedly promised them a better life in the United States and a loan of between $40,000 and $60,000. Once in the US, they were required to pay off their debt using earnings from prostitution, the statement says.\n\nIn some cases, the women owed even more money because the suspects allegedly demanded they get breast implants before leaving Thailand and added the cost to the victims' debt.\n\nVisa fraud\n\nIn addition to the trafficking accusations, the document alleges, the suspects also obtained fraudulent visas and travel documents to speed up the victims' relocation.\n\nAuthorities detailed an intricate operation that used nicknames to refer to the various players involved in the trade. \"House bosses\" were the owners of the homes used for prostitution while \"flowers\" were the women exploited for commercial sex, according to the indictment.\n\nJUST WATCHED Police save girls from trafficking in Vietnam Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police save girls from trafficking in Vietnam 03:16\n\n\"House bosses were responsible for day-to-day operations, including advertising the 'flowers' for commercial sex, maintaining the houses of prostitution, scheduling appointments with sex buyers ...\" the document alleges.\n\nOther operators included \"facilitators,\" who spearheaded the victims' movements in the US, and \"runners,\" who mostly accompanied the women when they left the prostitution house to ensure they don't try to escape, according to the documents.\n\nThailand human trafficking\n\nThe indictment comes months after Thailand received an upgrade in this year's US State Department report on human trafficking. After two years on the list of worst-rated countries, Thailand's efforts in the fight against human trafficking seemed to be paying off.\n\nAlthough the July report determined trafficking is still a significant problem in Thailand, it cited major improvements in investigations, prosecutions and convictions.\n\nThai officials said they're aware of the indictments against the 17 suspects, and are working with the US on the case.\n\n\"Thailand has adopted a zero tolerance policy toward human trafficking,\" the nation's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.\n\n\"Such cases exemplify the need for concerted efforts between nations in bringing the offenders to justice. Thailand stands ready to cooperate with the US.\"",

These are Republicans saying they will never vote for you. Marco Rubio himself even used that hashtag. What do you think of that?\"[TRUMP] \"Well, he can do whatever he wants. You know, I signed a pledge. And the pledge is a two-way street. And if it's not that way, you're going to have a big problem. They're going to have a big problem with me. We have tremendous amounts of people. We have - as you know, you know, I'm going to Alabama today. We're going to have 25,000 people and probably more than that. We had to go to a football stadium because no building held it. And we're going to have an amazing crowd. And yesterday in Tennessee, I had 15,000 people in a hangar. In Arkansas, you probably saw that one in the morning. In Arkansas, we had about 15,000 people in a hangar. And, you know, we have a lot of people. I'm representing people. I'm not representing myself. I'm representing a lot of anger out there, and there's - we're not angry people, but we're angry at the way this country's being run. And a lot of them are angry - angry at the way the Republican Party is being run, Jake\u2026.. [TAPPER] I want to ask you about that, because Republicans in Washington, D.C., are starting to tell Republican senators that they don't have to go to the convention if you're the nominee, that they should think about running against you if you're the nominee. That, combined with Marco Rubio doing the #neverTrump hashtag, do you think Republicans are violating the pledge? [TRUMP] Totally. Totally. I mean, if they want to play that game, I can play it much better than they can. And I have a lot more people than they do - and, you know, totally. If they're doing that, that's a total violation of the pledge, yes.\n\nTrump on his tax returns: \"Well, number one, I fully disclosed my financials. And I put them in actually right on time. And nobody else did, by the way, but I put them in on time. And it's almost 100 pages of financials. And it shows over $10 billion. If you figure it out, it's over $10 billion in net worth. And it's an amazing company with great cash flow, very little debt, all of that. You can't tell anything from tax returns, because you take deductions, massive deductions and lots of other things. And you can't tell very much from a tax return. You really can't tell anything as to that. As far as gifts, I give a lot of money. I could probably release a lot of the gifts that I have given over the years. And I probably will do that some time next week. We will just make a listing of the various monies that I have paid for two charities. And I think that's a good idea, actually. But I can't release tax returns when there's an audit. Now, it's very unfair. I have been treated very unfairly by the IRS, because I have been audited almost every year for 10 or 12 years. And I have friends that are very rich people.

OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. \" [TAPPER] \"But I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is, even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing you. Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support? \" [TRUMP] \"Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I would have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong. \" [TAPPER] \"The Ku Klux Klan? \" [TRUMP] \"But you may groups in there that are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So, give me a list of the groups, and I will let you know.\" [TAPPER] \"OK. I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...\"[TRUMP] I\" don't know any - honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him.\"\n\nTrump on who he would choose as his Vice President: \"Well, I have a great business ability. I have always had a great business ability. And I built a great company. And I don't need that, really, I don't believe, for what I'm doing. I would want somebody that can - you know, that does have a little bit of an insider track, so we can get things through Congress. He can work - he or she can work with me on getting, you know, papers filed, papers approved, so we don't have to use executive orders, like President Obama is always using his executive orders because he can't get - he just can't get anything approved. He can't get anything through. So, I would like the idea - I mean, just conceptually - it doesn't mean I'm going to do that, but, conceptually, I like the idea of a political person to go along with my abilities. Now, I'm a very political person also, which people are just about starting to find out. But I would rather have, I think, somebody that's political that can help. But the most important position - now, look, for vice president, you have got to pick somebody who's going to be a great president, because, if something should happen - hopefully not - but if something should happen, the single most important quality would be a person that can be a great president.\"\n\nFULL POST",

Hide Caption 17 of 17\n\nIt hasn't always been like this.\n\nFor most of aviation history, airlines operated in a tightly regulated, uncompetitive environment, where air fares usually cost a small fortune.\n\nDiscounted tickets weren't unheard of, but usually came with lots of strings attached, such as having to spend a certain number of nights at the destination.\n\nInternational routes were usually operated by the flag carriers of the countries involved, who would take a gentlemanly approach to competition and fare-setting.\n\nDeregulation -- a global liberalization trend which began with the US Deregulation Act of 1978 -- swept everything before it, from the industry structure to the way we think about air travel and airline fares.\n\nFiercely competitive\n\nIt's now all about revenue management, says Robert W. Mann, a consultant and former airline planning executive.\n\nAnd that's something, he says, has become increasingly complex and fiercely competitive in the past few decades.\n\n\"The growth of the network airline and the drop in the cost of computing has brought revenue management to whole new levels of sophistication,\" he tells CNN.\n\n\"Techniques such as Expected Marginal Seat Revenue (EMSR) look at the best ways to optimize fares in real time, not only on a given route, but taking into account revenue-generating opportunities across the whole airline network\".\n\nThis is why, for example, flying from London to Dubai may cost pretty much the same as flying all the way to Manila, also via Dubai.\n\nThat's because the airline may prefer to keep seats on the London-Dubai leg for higher-value passengers that fly longer onward journeys, and will use pricing to discourage those aiming to fly shorter trips.\n\nJUST WATCHED Playing the points game: Airmiles explained Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Playing the points game: Airmiles explained 06:25\n\nCustomer profiling\n\nBut how does the airline know who the higher-value passengers are and how much to charge them?\n\nStuart Barwood, founder of Travercial, an airline consultancy firm, says airlines can make a number of reasonable assumptions about the profile of traffic on a certain route and then adjust their prices accordingly.\n\n\"The London to Majorca route, for example, has a marked leisure profile. This has implications not only for fare levels but also for the way pricing changes over time.\n\n\"If the airline assumes that leisure passengers will tend to book relatively early, months before their holidays, it may be tempted to start pricing seats on that route relatively high. It would then adjust them according to the market response.\n\n\"Meanwhile on a typical business route -- let's say London to Frankfurt -- the airline may start with low prices to fill a minimum of capacity, then raise prices steeply for business travelers that book at the last minute.\"\n\nIn fact, those last-minute high-value passengers are so precious that some airlines go the extra mile to make room for them.\n\nFor example, a service developed by Barcelona-based company Caravelo helps airlines identify those passengers most likely to accept a flight swap in exchange for compensation, such as vouchers or frequent flier miles, and offers to rebook them on a later flight.\n\nWith space then cleared, the high-fare passengers are then booked onto the previously full flight.\n\nTowards total customization\n\nYou might think of fare classes in terms of economy, business and first class, but the reality is airlines have dozens of subdivisions.\n\nThe airline will adjust the number of seats allocated to each fare class. When one class has been sold, the sale price will leap to the next one.\n\nThis is how most fares are currently set, but it's still some way off from the ultimate goal: Airlines want to know their clients so well they're able to offer fully personalized pricing.\n\nLoyalty programs, registered users and cookie tracking can give airlines some valuable clues, but even when an airline has gathered a lot of data about its passengers they still might not be putting it to profitable use.\n\nAdding up the extras\n\n\"In reality, it is quite common for passenger data to be scattered throughout several functional areas within an airline, kept in data silos where it is of little use to the revenue management department,\" says Barwood.\n\nAirlines might be lagging behind the likes of Amazon when it comes to personalized marketing, but Barwood says many are getting up to speed with data management and this is already being felt in pricing and marketing.\n\nRevenue management systems will increasingly take into account not only the air fare itself, but the total value a passenger can generate for the airline, including ancillary revenue.\n\nThat's all the extras that can be added to your base fare, and it's a growing source of profit.\n\nUsing seat choice as an example, many airlines now charge for the privilege of picking your seats in advance.\n\nThis could, in theory, be managed dynamically. Why not base seat prices on the occupancy of a given flight? Or charge less to members of your loyalty program?\n\nThis kind of profiling might be beneficial to the loyalty program customer in this instance, but what about when a frequent business traveler is then consistently shown higher fares when they're trying to book a family vacation?\n\nIt could well prompt a backlash among the sort of high value customers that every airline hopes to retain.\n\nProtecting the brand\n\nJUST WATCHED The loophole letting passengers fly on the cheap Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The loophole letting passengers fly on the cheap 06:33\n\nAnd while airlines may have good reasons not to overcharge their best customers, they also have to be careful not to undercharge the other classes of client.\n\nThe temptation is to aggressively lower prices when there are still empty seats left before a flight departs -- but if this becomes the norm there's a serious risk of undermining the brand and alienating higher-value passengers.\n\nA number of companies, such as Bidflyer, Plusgrade and SeatFrog, have come up with applications that allow airlines to sell upgrades to the highest bidder through an auction mechanism -- an efficient but anonymous way to get passengers to tell the airline how much they're willing to pay for premium services.\n\nBack to basics\n\nThe apparent randomness of airfares makes for an excellent conversation topic with friends and colleagues, but it can also be a source of anxiety for many travelers.\n\nPerceptions that prices are immensely variable can add to the fear that customers may be overcharged for any extras they inadvertently purchase, or the worry that they might not be getting the best deal out there.\n\nWhich is why many airlines have opted for a different approach: go back to basics and offer branded fares -- a bundle of services for a closed price.\n\nThis shouldn't be confused with the rigid fare system that prevailed when the first low-cost airlines hit the scene.\n\nThis is more like an evolution of the low-cost fare system which lets customers choose the extras they want to add to the base fare.\n\nThis approach means re-bundling a bunch of services -- from checked-in luggage to a wider, more spacious seat --- into a number of fare package options of varying complexity, all selling for a set price.\n\nThink of it as like the menu options at a fast food joint.\n\nThe airfare arms race\n\nAirlines might have a whole battery of tools to help them extract the most revenue from their passengers, but travelers can also call on their own arsenal of technological countermeasures.\n\nCompanies such as Skyscanner and Kayak have introduced fare alerts which allow you to monitor fares for specific flights and get automated alerts the moment they change.\n\nSome companies are also developing fare prediction technology that promises to help travelers book their flights at the optimal moment, when the fare is likely to be lower.\n\nIn order to do this they rely on their own algorithms, plus a heap of historical data on air fares.\n\nCalifornia-based FLYR uses its own proprietary fare prediction technology to offer fare lock-in insurance in partnership with TripAdvisor.\n\nThis service is similar to buying a financial option where you pay a relatively small premium in advance, to make sure you won't pay more than a certain amount at a later date.\n\nIt also works with travel agents and other distribution partners to optimize bookings.\n\nSeizing the moment\n\nFLYR's founder, Dutch entrepreneur Alexander Mans, says that outside a 30-day window of a flight's date of departure, there is a 60 to 70% chance that a specific air fare will drop in price at some point.\n\n\"It is practically impossible for someone to monitor this manually, but with our computing resources we can predict pretty accurately the chances of a fare coming down and advise on the best course of action.\n\n\"If we think a fare is going to be lower in the future, we recommend waiting, before hitting the 'book' button.\"\n\nHopper is another company specializing in the field of airfare prediction. Its mobile app, which has been downloaded more than eight million times, uses big data technology to predict fares as much as 12 months in advance.\n\n\"Our system looks at six to eight billion air fares every day. Our database has five years of historical fares, that means trillions of prices!\" Frederic Lalonde, Hopper's founder and CEO, declares proudly.\n\nHe claims their algorithms are capable of accurately predicting an airfare within $5, up to six months before departure.\n\n\"We are confident enough in our system to predict actual figures and to tell our customers whether they are getting a good fare or not.\n\n\"We have tracked our accuracy to 95%. Whether people later follow our advice or not is another story...\"\n\nWith this amount of computing power being thrown into the field of airline pricing and the expectation that artificial intelligence technology will go mainstream, it might ultimately be up to the robots to fight the airfare war.\n\nThis isn't necessarily bad news -- it may result in better choices and more efficient booking processes.\n\nWith virtually millions of different air fares -- as many as the number of passengers airlines carry every year -- what seems assured is that airline fares will continue to be a topic of conversation by the office cooler for years to come.",

    "text": "Zeba Khan is a writer focused on how Islam intersects with race, politics, and identity. Follow her @zebakhan . The views expressed are her own.\n\n(CNN) Last week, President Barack Obama held a town hall at which he was asked why he doesn't use the term \"Islamic\" terrorism. The president's explanation was similar to the one he has given in the past -- groups like ISIS \"have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam,\" he explained. As commander-in-chief he does not \"want to validate what they do\" and potentially alienate Muslim allies in the fight against them.\n\nThe president is right. Unfortunately, his solution isn't much better.\n\nAlthough most of the U.S. media refer to the terrorist group as ISIS or their preferred name, the Islamic State, President Obama almost exclusively refers to them as ISIL, an acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The term Levant is a historical term for Greater Syria, which includes many of the countries on the eastern side of the Mediterranean.\n\nSome conservatives have suggested that Obama's insistence on using the term ISIL is a strategy to avoid dealing with Syria . Donald Trump called it a tactic to \"bother people .\"\n\nThe problem is that whatever his motivation, the term ISIL still validates the terrorists' claims in the exact way \"Islamic\" terrorism does.\n\nSo, what should President Obama call the group? The same thing most of our allies in the region -- and increasingly around the world -- call them: Daesh.\n\nDaesh is the Arabic acronym for ISIL. It spells out word for word in Arabic what ISIL spells out in English. But the term Daesh doesn't carry the same meaning in an Arabic-speaking context as ISIL does in an English-speaking context. In fact, it has the exact opposite effect than the terrorists want.\n\nAcronyms are not common in Arabic as they are in English, so an Arabic acronym as a concept comes off as a weird invention -- something that is made up and not real. The acronym can also be seen as a play on words given it is just one letter away from the Arabic word 'daes' meaning something or someone who crushes or tramples.\n\nSo where the idea behind the names ISIS, ISIL, and the Islamic State is to evoke power and authentic religious authority, Daesh as a name undermines those goals in the ears of native Arabic speakers. Muslim satirists in the region have taken advantage of that fact, and are using the term as part of subversive comedic critiques of the militants.\n\nDaesh may technically just be the Arabic acronym for ISIL, but it is a name that actively undercuts the power these militants wish to convey to native speakers. And because each letter represents an Arabic word, it weakens the terrorists' ability to convey the narrative they want to non-Arabic-speaking audiences as well.\n\nThe group is sensitive enough to this aspect of its usage that they've threatened to cut the tongues out of anyone who refers to them by Daesh. That alone should be reason enough for the Obama administration to make a complete switch, something I argued back in 2014.\n\nBut it's not just the terrorists who understand the strategic value the name Daesh has for their enemies. Over the past several years, Daesh has become the preferred term of the global community and specifically of our partners in the fight against terror. The leadership of ally countries, including France, the UK, Australia and Turkey, have shifted primarily if not exclusively to using the term Daesh. Last year, Russia also made a complete switch throughout its government and media.\n\nThese countries followed the example of heads of state and media in the Middle East as well as non-state actors, such as the Iraqi Kurds, Assyrian Christians, and Syrian activists, one of whom created the acronym in 2013. Larger organizing bodies such as the Arab League also adopted the term.\n\nTrue, Secretary of State John Kerry uses the term Daesh regularly, particularly when speaking to international audiences. Yet the administration continues to maintain an official policy of using ISIL. And just as the President remarked this past June that the term \"radical Islam\" serves no military strategy, neither do the names \"ISIL,\" \"ISIS,\" or \"IS.\"\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSome commentators believe that because it is an Arabic acronym, Daesh is too difficult or confusing for the American public to understand or say. Some have also suggested that because we've been using \"ISIL\" and \"ISIS\" for years, it's too late to change how we talk about them.\n\nBut the American people deserve more credit than that. Americans understand the Arabic words \"Taliban\" and \"al Qaeda\" -- the U.S. government never felt the need to translate those into their English equivalents, \"Students\" and \"The Base.\"\n\nAnd while there may be some confusion initially, if President Obama makes the decision to officially change how his administration talks about these terrorists and explains to the country why he's doing so as part of our overall strategy, the country will follow.\n\nGiven what's at stake, and the low cost of shifting our language, there's no reason not to make this change -- and plenty of reasons why we should.",

Bombardier's new CS100 feels roomy, like a double-aisle widebody airliner, even though it only has one aisle.\n\nAvgeeks at Farnborough got a good look at this plane as pilots put it through its paces in the sky over southern England.\n\nYou may be flying on this plane soon because Delta Air Lines, the world's second largest carrier, agreed to buy at least 75 of them earlier this year. The airline has left the door open to the possibility it may buy more.\n\nWith a seating capacity of 110-125, it's the first narrow body airliner designed from scratch in nearly 30 years. Range: about 3,500 miles.\n\nBombardier designed the plane to be very efficient, with lightweight, super-strong carbon fiber wings and fuel-sipping jet engines.\n\nKey consumer features include high cabin ceilings, larger lavatories, bigger windows and quieter engines.\n\nThe CS100 will be followed by larger versions.\n\nAirbus A350-900\n\nIn action: Airbus's next-gen A350 XWB.\n\nFarnborough has seen this twin-engine marvel before -- but it remained a big hit again this year -- thrilling crowds Tuesday with stunning tight turns and low passes over the airfield.\n\nAirbus test pilot Isabelle de Montet-Guerin shows #avgeek @thompatterson the A350 flight management system at #FIA16 pic.twitter.com/7ZW1zukjGs \u2014 CNN Travel (@CNNTravel) July 13, 2016\n\nOne thing that sets the A350 apart is that more than 50% of it is made of strong, lightweight carbon fiber instead of traditional aluminum.\n\nBuilding airliners with carbon fiber is expensive, but it gives back a lot in return -- like low-pressure cabins that help prevent passenger jet lag. Lightweight carbon fiber saves fuel, which can cut operating costs for airlines. Whether those savings are passed on to consumers... well that's up to them.\n\nDelta Air Lines is set to begin flying the A350 in 2017.\n\nThe planes seat 315 passengers in a two-class layout. They have a top speed of about 85% of the speed of sound. Their amazing range has allowed airlines like Qatar Airways to use them on ultra long-haul routes like Doha, Qatar, to Boston. Flight time: 12 hours.\n\nWhat's the next trick for the amazing A350?\n\nThe next version is called the A350-1000. Sir Richard Branson stopped by the airshow on Monday to let us know that the airline he founded is going to add a dozen A350-1000s to its fleet starting in 2019.\n\nInvesting in 1 of the youngest, cleanest, greenest fleets in the sky https://t.co/nyarT5FiKM @virginatlantic #FIA16 pic.twitter.com/dfPp7obHy2 \u2014 Richard Branson (@richardbranson) 11 July 2016\n\nBoeing 787-9 Dreamliner\n\nBy the end of 2016, passengers of American Airlines may have the chance to fly on a Boeing 787-9.\n\nAlthough it first entered service in 2014, Boeing's 787-9 still gets star treatment at world-class airshows like Farnborough. And this year has been no exception.\n\nBeginning in November 2016, the world's biggest carrier, American Airlines, is expected to start flying the -9.\n\nLike the A350, the Dreamliner's carbon fiber design is creating new, ultra long-haul routes.\n\nIn 2016, a -9 started flying the longest non-stop route by a U.S. airline: Singapore to San Francisco -- 16 hours, 20 minutes.\n\nThe -9 version is 6 meters (20 feet) longer than the 787-8 and can carry nearly 50 more passengers.\n\nThe next version of the 787 Dreamliner, the 787-10, is expected to make its first flight in 2018.\n\nEmbraer E190-E-2\n\nEmbraer's energy-saving new jet -- the E190-E2.\n\nEmbraer showed off a mockup of its new regional jet at Farnborough -- the E190-E2 \u2014 which made its first flight last May. The plane carries 75-130 passengers and boasts efficient engines and a clever wing design for its ability to slash fuel usage by 14.5%, over previous Embraer jetliners.\n\nThe E190-E2 is expected to start flying paying passengers in 2018.\n\nBoeing 737MAX\n\n737MAX: The latest version of Boeing's most popular selling jet.\n\nHappy birthday Boeing! The same week as the airshow, Boeing celebrates its 100th anniversary. The company that brought you the 737 back in 1967, brought a sweet present to the party this year: the 737MAX -- the latest version of Boeing's most popular selling jet.\n\nThe MAX looks nothing like its stodgy, uncool 1960s relative.\n\nThis guy sits low to the ground, like a stylish, low rider cruising through East LA.\n\nCapacity: You and 162-200 of your friends can enjoy a flight in this plane.\n\nIt's got new, super efficient, super quiet LEAP -1B engines, designed especially for this plane.\n\nAvgeek alert: Plane spotters check the crazy winglets.\n\nBoeing calls them \"AT\" -- for advance technology -- and no other airplane has them. So, if you see these things on the tips of the wings, you'll know without a doubt it's a 737MAX.\n\nFirst taking flight in January 2016, the 737MAX is set to start commercial service with Southwest Airlines in late 2017.\n\nThese five planes -- and others at Farnborough this year -- won't merely transport us, they'll help us cross thresholds of our lives.\n\nThrough leaps in technology, they become more sophisticated with each generation.\n\nWhat will the next generation of airliners bring? I can't wait to find out!",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) The US announced Monday it is \"suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia\" that had come about as part of the short-lived cessation of hostilities in Syria.\n\n\"This is not a decision that was taken lightly,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement announcing the suspension.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, who spent months negotiating with his Russian counterpart in order to bring about a ceasefire in Syria, spoke Tuesday about the end of bilateral talks and emphasized that the US was not giving up on peace or the Syrian people.\n\n\"Yesterday, as most of you saw, the United States announced our decision to suspend the bilateral discussions with Russia on the re-institution of the cessation of the hostilities agreement. A decision that, believe me, does not come lightly,\" Kerry told an audience in Brussels, Belgium, while speaking on Transatlantic relations.\n\nKerry stressed that the US would continue to pursue diplomatic initiatives to curb the violence in Syria that has sprung from the civil war there.\n\n\"I want to be very, very clear to everybody: We are not giving up on the Syrian people. We are not abandoning the pursuit of peace. We are not going to leave the multilateral field. We are going to continue to try to find a way forward in order to end this war.\"\n\nKerry also slammed both Russia and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad for their role in perpetuating the conflict.\n\n\"Together, the Syrian regime and Russia, seem to have rejected diplomacy in furtherance of trying to pursue a military victory over the broken bodies, the bombed-out hospitals, the traumatized children of a long-suffering land,\" he said.\n\nThe White House on Monday had similarly harsh words for Russia's behavior.\n\n\"Everybody's patience with Russia has run out,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.\n\nEarnest said Russia had lost credibility by \"making a series of commitments without any indication they were committed to following them,\" accusing Russia and its Syrian regime allies of trying \"to bomb civilian populations into submission.\"\n\nKerry last week had threatened to call off bilateral talks with Russia unless Moscow took immediate steps to end the assault on Aleppo and restore a ceasefire.\n\nThe statement announcing the suspension said the Russian and the Syrian regime's unwillingness to uphold the cease-fire accord was \"demonstrated by their intensified attacks against civilian areas, targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need.\"\n\nUS military and civilian personnel that were sent to Geneva, Switzerland, to work with the Russians on the Joint Implementation Center will now be withdrawn home, according to the statement and US defense officials.\n\nThe Joint Implementation Center was a key element of the negotiated accord and was intended to facilitate collaboration between the American and Russian militaries in targeting ISIS and al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, the al Nusra front. The center was never launched because the agreement had required that the cease-fire hold and aid deliveries must be allowed for at least seven days prior to the center's starting work.\n\nOfficials said the US and Russia will continue to communicate via previously established direct military-to-military channels as part of a safety effort to \"de-conflict\" Syrian airspace and allow for coalition and Russian warplanes to avoid dangerous accidental incidents.\n\nState Department spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters Monday that US and Russian officials had met through the weekend to discuss Syria. The suspension \"does not preclude multi-lateral dialogue\" with Russia regarding Syria, Trudeau added.\n\nWhen asked if the US had lived up to its end of the cease-fire deal, Trudeau said, \"We believe we did.\"\n\nFor its part, Moscow announced Monday that it was suspending an arms reduction agreement with the US in which both countries agreed to dispose of 34 tons of plutonium, enough for thousands of nuclear bombs, over what it called Washington's \"unfriendly actions\" toward Russia, state news agency TASS reported.\n\nIn a statement published on the Russian Foreign Ministry's website, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said: \"The decision we have made is a signal to Washington: attempts at talking to Russia from the position of strength, in a language of sanctions and ultimatums while continuing selective cooperation with our country ... where this cooperation benefits the United States will not succeed.\"\n\nAsked if the Russian announcement was linked to the recent US decision regarding the suspension of bilateral Syria talks, Trudeau said, \"I would not link those at all.\"\n\n\"We believe it would be a shame if this important agreement was put aside because of an unrelated issue,\" she added.\n\nJUST WATCHED Former Russian FM: Moscow not interested in Syria talks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former Russian FM: Moscow not interested in Syria talks 10:56\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed regret over Washington's decision Monday to stop participating in the bilateral channels with Russia.\n\nShortly after Zakharova's response, Konstantin Kosachev, head of Russia's Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the decision by the US.\n\n\"Russia has striven for continuing dialogue with the US on Syria until the last moment, and only our position was keeping the chance to launch a stable peace process alive,\" he said, according to Russian state-owned Sputnik News.\n\nHe also accused Washington of making the decision because of campaign politics, saying it was based \"to a great extent on subjective factors linked with the current presidential election cycle.\"\n\nThe UN's special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said he \"deeply regrets\" the fact that the US-Russia talks \"did not reach a positive conclusion,\" according to a statement issued in the wake of the announcement.\n\n\"The UN will continue to push energetically for a political solution of the Syrian conflict regardless of the very disappointing outcome of intense and long discussions among two crucial international stakeholders,\" the statement said.",

    "text": "(CNN) Polio is a highly infectious disease that can lead to paralysis -- even death. Thankfully, most children today are unfamiliar with the virus, as it was eliminated from the United States in 1979 .\n\nBut this week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a spike in a mysterious polio-like illness, confirmed this year in nearly half of the states in the country. From January 1 to August 31, 50 people in 24 states were diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis . Most of the cases are in children.\n\nLike polio, AFM affects the body's nervous system -- specifically, the spinal cord -- and can cause paralysis. Unlike polio, there is no vaccine for AFM.\n\nWhat we know: AFM first spiked in August 2014. By the end of that year, 120 people had been diagnosed in 34 states. The year 2015 saw just 21 people diagnosed in 16 states. Cases diagnosed in September of this year will be reported at the end of October.\n\nWhat we do not know: the exact cause of the illness, though scientists think it is most likely the result of a viral infection. Other potential culprits include environmental toxins, genetic disorders and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome , according to the CDC.\n\n\"This is a very rare condition, but I think it's important that we take it seriously because it does have long-term and potentially disabling consequences,\" said Dr. Kevin Messacar , a pediatric infectious disease physician and researcher at Children's Hospital Colorado\n\nWhat is acute flaccid myelitis?\n\n\"The key with AFM is that it's sudden onset,\" said Dr. Manisha Patel, AFM team lead at CDC and a practicing pediatrician. \"Symptoms include limb weakness, facial drooping and difficulty swallowing and talking.\n\n\"AFM is an illness that can be seen with a variety of different causes. The most famous one is polio, but there are also enteroviruses, which are circulating very broadly in the US and other countries.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED What is Enterovirus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is Enterovirus? 01:40\n\n\"What we saw ... is that the majority of children had a fever and a respiratory illness,\" said Messacar. \"Five days later, they would develop pain in the arms and legs, and weakness followed.\"\n\nMessacar and his colleagues have followed their hospital's 12 AFM patients since 2014. He said most of them are doing better than when they first came into the emergency room, but the majority continue to have some level of disability.\n\n\"It's important to understand that there's a wide spectrum of severity of this disease,\" said Messacar. On one end, you see mild weakness in one extremity, he said. On the other, you've got children who have lost the ability to breathe on their own, and exhibit complete paralysis in their arms and legs.\n\nPatel and Messacar agree: There are no known proven, effective therapies. Both doctors stress the importance of recognizing the early signs of AFM and seeking care as soon as possible.\n\n\"A doctor can tell the difference between AFM and other diseases with a careful examination of the nervous system, looking at the location of the weakness, muscle tone and reflexes,\" according to the CDC's website. \"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be very helpful in diagnosing cases of AFM.\"\n\n\"Finally, by testing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, the fluid bathing the brain and spinal cord), clinicians can look for findings suggestive of AFM,\" according to the CDC.\n\nThere is no cure for AFM. Treatment only focuses on alleviating symptoms.\n\nHow worried should you be?\n\n\"CDC is always concerned when there is a serious illness that is affecting the public, especially when it's affecting children,\" said Patel. \"We're looking closely at what might be causing this, and what might put someone at risk for AFM.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Patel encourages practicing what she calls \"general prevention strategies\" -- washing your hands with soap and water, getting vaccinated and preventing mosquito bites.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThere is some good news here. \"Enteroviruses tend to appear in the late summer and early fall, and go away in the winter,\" said Messacar. \"So we expect to see [AFM cases] decrease based on the epidemiology of enteroviruses.\"\n\n\"We understand this condition better than we did in 2014, but there's still a lot to learn,\" said Messacar. \"The process is slow, but progress is being made.\"",

Abbott is vice chair for education at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Boston University School of Medicine. Eugene Declercq, founder of Birth by the Numbers, is professor and assistant dean at Community Health Sciences Department, Boston University School of Public Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\n\n(CNN) Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are going to have a baby girl.\n\nIn his public post that went viral, Zuckerberg wrote: \"We want to share one experience to start. We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way. You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience.\"\n\nZuckerberg's frank admission of his wife's three miscarriages led to a vast outpouring of stories from women and families who have faced a similar situation.\n\nMillennials have become accustomed to posting their lives online, and yet, as they are coupling and starting families they are discovering that few experiences are as isolating as losing a desired pregnancy.\n\nEugene Declercq\n\nJodi F. Abbott\n\nOn top of that, there is a certain stigma associated with miscarriages, as though it's the fault of the parents. But it isn't, and the stigma will be removed only if we talk about it more -- openly and honestly. There is no shame in having a miscarriage.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "But according to a survey by StubHub, in this era, there's one key desire that can't be overlooked: bandwidth.\n\nThe ticket seller's 2014-15 study of consumer insights (PDF) , shared with CNN, shows that smartphones and social media have become increasingly important in this Internet-encrusted age. It's not enough to attend the game; you have to show everyone you're there, too, preferably with a selfie or Facebook tag.\n\nTechnology is \"really changing the way fans are attending live events, whether it be sports, concerts or otherwise,\" StubHub spokesman Cameron Papp said.\n\nFor example, Super Bowl data usage has more than tripled since 2011. At the 2011 Super Bowl, fans used 177 GB of data. Three years later, that number had shot up to 624 GB.\n\nMoreover, the number of social posts uploaded from the event jumped from 500,000 to 1.8 million.\n\n\"It seems like you can't attend a sports event without taking a picture now,\" Papp said.\n\nHere are some other takeaways from StubHub's research:\n\nThe most popular North American pro sports team by Twitter followers is from the NBA.\n\nThat would be the Los Angeles Lakers, which has about 4.5 million followers.\n\nThe leading squads from the other three major pro sports leagues -- the New York Yankees (MLB), the New England Patriots (NFL) and the Chicago Blackhawks (NHL) -- have between 1.1 and 1.7 million followers.\n\n\"The NFL dominates American conversations,\" Papp said. \"But the NBA is much more of a global brand, and the Lakers are a global brand.\"\n\nPro baseball teams dominate the list of top sellers overall -- but for individual games, college teams have some power.\n\nThat's partly because there are 81 home games for each MLB team, says Papp, so teams such as the San Francisco Giants, the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have more events to sell. (StubHub did not reveal prices.)\n\nIntriguingly, however, the single-game leader is the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team. That's a case of a high-performing team and the laws of supply and demand, says Papp, since capacity at tiny Cameron Indoor Stadium is fewer than 10,000 seats.\n\n\"When you think about the hardest ticket to get and the hottest ticket, it makes sense,\" he said.\n\nOther college teams on the per-event list include the Notre Dame, Texas A&M and Alabama football teams, popular squads all.\n\nThe musical tastes of sports leagues' fans don't necessarily fit the leagues' popular images.\n\nStubHub asked, \"If you bought a specific (pro team's) ticket at StubHub in the past 5 years, what other concert purchase have you made this year?\"\n\nThough the answers were necessarily skewed by who was touring in the past couple years, there were still a few surprises.\n\nSure, some relationships fit expectations. The NFL skewed more country than the other pro leagues, with top draws including Luke Bryan and Garth Brooks. New Yorker Billy Joel was the top selection for fans of the Jets, Devils, Islanders, Knicks and Mets. Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers rooters both had the Bay Area's Grateful Dead at the top of their lists.\n\nBut NHL fans weren't all hard rockers -- Ottawa Senators fans picked One Direction -- and MLB fans, perhaps tabbed as old, included matchups with Ariana Grande (Milwaukee Brewers) and the ubiquitous Taylor Swift (Atlanta Braves, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates and Tampa Bay Rays).\n\nMore bandwidth? Or less?\n\nSmartphones and other portable devices aren't going away. Will venues accommodate them or stick with the idea that the game's the thing?\n\nPapp isn't sure.\n\n\"I don't think stadiums have really caught up to this yet,\" he said.\n\nCertainly, newer facilities are focusing on multimedia fan experiences. Levi's Stadium, where the 2016 Super Bowl will be held, was called \"the most high-tech sports venue yet\" in a 2014 Time article -- which only makes sense, since it's in the heart of Silicon Valley.\n\nComcast, one of the country's biggest bandwidth providers, will have a prominent presence at the Atlanta Braves' new SunTrust Park, scheduled to open in 2017.\n\nBut fans are also keenly familiar with the sensation of sitting down at their seats, trying to post something to social media -- and being met by the \"spinning wheel of death.\" Moreover, as technology ventures into new areas, such as the live streaming of Periscope or Meerkat, venues and teams may consider it a threat, not a boon.\n\nOn the concert side, there has already been a backlash against fans using cellphones, Papp observes, with some venues blocking signals.\n\nSports, too, is part of an ever-evolving relationship.\n\n\"As far as a team is concerned, they just want to get butts in the seats,\" he said. \"You want to get people in, and if you can do it with technology, you're going to do that, and you'll make it easier to share with their friends.\"",

My generation, we Gchat, a million tiny windows blinking orange with hopes and dreams and YouTube links, with five-year plans and lunch plans. So as I began to search for a single phrase that could, preposterously, describe our entire cohort, post-crash, I did what I always do in moments of crisis. I Gchatted my 24-year-old sister Clare, who happens to be living back at home with our parents while she looks for a job:\n\n(10:24 p.m.) CLARE: how about they just call us SAA\n\nself-absorbed assholes\n\nME: booo\n\nCLARE: we need a D\n\nto make it really good\n\nSAD\u0097self-absorbed delusionals\n\nps\n\n(10:26) can i send you a cover letter right quick?\n\nME: sure\n\n(10:28) CLARE:\n\nour generation is:\n\ndelayed\n\nafraid\n\nimmature\n\n(10:29) independent\n\nfame and glory hungry\n\n(ambitious?)\n\nweirdly apathetic when it comes to things outside of the internet\n\n(10:32) ME: delayed is not our fault\n\nCLARE: ok, you know what i always think about when i think of our generation? i read the david brooks book, \u0093the social animal\u0094 and while it was only mediocre, he had this one really great bit that really stuck with me\u0097the Greek ideal of \u0093thumos\u0094, which is the lust not for money or success (in the conventional sense) but the lust for glory\n\nwe want glory through our ideas-we want to know we matter\n\n(10:33) the cold truth is that not all of us are brilliant\n\nwe are not all big thinkers. Not everyone\u2019s TED talks will change the world\n\nsome of us will just dissipate into the ether\n\n(10:34) but it is the digital connectivity, that proximity to these people, that makes us think that perhaps we will succeed as well\n\n(10:35) ok, i\u2019m done\n\n(10:36) no i\u2019m not\n\nhere\u2019s why the recession is so devastating to us\n\nwe grew up, all the way through college, with everything seeming so ripe and possible\n\n(10:37) we had a PC education\u0097people tried to hide from us as long as possible that not everyone is equal\n\nwe were told we all have a fair chance of making it\n\nthat\u2019s just not so\n\nand we\u2019re starting to realize that\n\n(10:39) are you even listening to me anymore?\n\n(10:41) ME: hi sorry\n\n(10:42) i was writing an email\n\ni am filing your comments\n\nin my file.\n\n(10:43) i think\n\nyour cover letter is good!\n\nCLARE: i thought it was ok\n\n(10:47) but I am, to be honest, expecting a rejection.\n\nI know this might read as very woe-is-us, but these are the facts: Nearly 14 percent of college graduates from the classes of 2006 through 2010 can\u2019t find full-time work, and overall just 55.3 percent of people ages 16 to 29 have jobs. That\u2019s the lowest percentage since World War II, as you might have heard an Occupy Wall Street protester point out. (Not coincidentally, one in five young adults now lives below the poverty line.) Almost a quarter more people ages 25 to 34\u0097in other words, people who should be a few years into their independent lives\u0097are living with their parents than at the beginning of the recession.\n\nBeing young is supposed to mean you have the luxury of time. But in hard times, a few fallow years can become a lifetime drag on what you earn, sort of the opposite of compound interest. Because the average person grabs 70 percent of their total pay bumps during their first ten years in the workforce, according to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, having stagnant or nonexistent \u00adwages during that period means you hit that springboard at a crawl. Economist Lisa Kahn explained to The Atlantic in 2010 that those who graduate into a recession are still earning an average of 10 percent less nearly two decades into their careers. In hard, paycheck-shrinking numbers, the salary lost over that stretch totals around $100,000. That works out to $490 or so less a month, money that could go, say, toward repaying student loans, which for the class of 2009 average $24,000. Those student loans (the responsible borrowing option!) have reportedly passed credit cards as the nation\u2019s largest source of debt. This is not just a rotten moment to be young. It\u2019s a putrid, stinking, several-months-old-stringy-goat-meat moment to be young.\n\nEarlier generations have weathered recessions, of course; this stall we\u2019re in has the look of something nastier. Social Security and Medicare are going to be diminished, at best. Hours worked are up even as hiring staggers along: Blood from a stone looks to be the normal order of things \u0093going forward,\u0094 to borrow the business-speak. Economists are warning that even when the economy recuperates, full employment will be lower and growth will be slower\u0097a sad little rhyme that adds up to something decidedly \u00adunpoetic. A majority of Americans say, for the first time ever, that this generation will not be better off than its parents.",

    "text": "Erbil, Iraq (CNN) On a dusty plain to the east of Mosul, cranes are lowering concrete walls into place as prefabricated living quarters are trucked in.\n\nIt's a race against time: this will be an improvised base for troops from Iraq's 9th Armored Division amid final preparations for the assault to end ISIS' control of Iraq's second largest city and the group's last major stronghold in the country.\n\nIraqi troops were last in this part of northern Iraq in summer 2014, when they were fleeing the rampant advance of ISIS fighters.\n\nNow, as part of an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government and the United States, they are preparing to reverse that humiliating loss.\n\n\"Today, you are closer than any time in the past to get rid of Daesh's injustice and tyranny,\" Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi told the people of Mosul on Tuesday, in the first live official telecast of state media to Mosul from Baghdad.\n\nSome 4,000 troops of the Iraqi Security Forces are expected to arrive in this sector within days. Among the advance party of some 160 soldiers, relations with local Kurdish Peshmerga officers appear cordial and the mood relaxed.\n\nThere are regular meetings between the two sides and a Joint Operations Room has been set up. The Kurds -- who have played a key role in the fightback against ISIS -- say their role will be to support the ISF when the offensive gets underway, but they won't enter Mosul itself, a largely Sunni-Arab city.\n\nAt newly established front lines, bulldozers carve deep trenches out of the flinty soil to deter the most feared of ISIS' weapons: large suicide truck bombs. The villages immediately behind the front lines, occupied by ISIS until recent months, are still empty, some of their buildings obliterated by airstrikes.\n\nMoats filled with oil\n\nWhen asked when the attack will begin, Iraqi and Peshmerga officers have the same one-word answer: \"Soon.\" It's widely thought that the multipronged offensive will begin in the second half of this month. In the meantime, there's been an uptick in coalition airstrikes -- mainly by US, French and British aircraft -- in and around Mosul.\n\nBy day there is scant evidence of movement or an ISIS presence among the ruined villages they still control to the east of Mosul. But Kurdish fighters say the enemy uses the cover of night to approach their positions with mortars and snipers.\n\nEveryone expects a tough battle ahead. In the two years it has held Mosul, ISIS has built an elaborate network of defenses, including moats filled with oil that stretch around the outskirts of the city, ready to be set ablaze to obscure the vision of coalition air power.\n\nUS military officials estimate there are 3,500-5,000 ISIS fighters, a mixture of Iraqis and foreign fighters, in Mosul. ISIS supporters claim there are at least 7,000 fighters there.\n\nJUST WATCHED ISIS' battle tactics Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH ISIS' battle tactics 02:19\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nBut there are many other unknowns as the battle for Mosul looms:\n\nHow many ISIS fighters will stay to fight -- and how many will try to escape to fight another day? If not captured or killed, they could splinter into terror cells across a wide swath of Iraq.\n\nHow much support does ISIS retain in the city, if any, and where is it concentrated?\n\nHow many among the approximately 1 million civilians still thought to be trapped in the city will try to leave, and how many will hunker down?\n\nAnd will there be an uprising against the ISIS presence among the city's people as the offensive nears the gates of Mosul? There has already been sporadic resistance, according to reports from inside Mosul.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mosul's secret resistance against ISIS Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mosul's secret resistance against ISIS 02:39\n\nSome Peshmerga commanders expect it will take at least three months to clear the city as ISIS leaves sleeper cells behind. Others expect a quicker victory, with ISIS leaders choosing to retreat to the vast desert west of Mosul.\n\nUntested alliance\n\nThere are also plenty of questions about the forces ranged against ISIS in Mosul. The offensive will be led by the Iraqi Security Forces. Some, such as the Golden Division, have had plenty of battle experience -- in Fallujah, Ramadi and elsewhere. But some contingents have only just finished training. Their relationship with the Peshmerga is untested.\n\nPrime Minister al-Abadi and KRG President Masoud Barzani have agreed that only the ISF and Peshmerga will take part in the operation, but a variety of other militia also want to be involved.\n\nThey include Yazidi, Turkmen and Christian battalions trained and armed since the fall of Mosul, as well as a contingent of former Mosul military and police trained by Turkey and under the command of the city's former governor, Atheel al Nujaifi.\n\n\"We will raise the Iraqi flag in the center of the city of Mosul as we have raised it in Qayyara and Shirqat, and before it in Baiji, Tikrit, Ramadi, and Falluja and many other towns and villages that have been returned to the people of Iraq,\" al-Abadi said in his radio address.\n\nThe Turkish trainers -- and heavy artillery -- remain on Mount Bashiqa some 15 kilometers (9 miles) northeast of Mosul. CNN has witnessed Turkish guns opening up against ISIS positions on the plains below.\n\nThe Iraqi government has told Turkey its presence is unwelcome, but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Turkish parliament on Saturday: \"We will play a role in the Mosul liberation operation and no-one can prevent us from participating.\"\n\nBut the powerful Shia militia, known as the Hashd al Shabi, is not expected to have a direct role in the offensive to take Mosul, an overwhelmingly Sunni city. Human rights groups have accused the Hashd of widespread abuses during assaults on other largely Sunni areas.\n\nCivilian exodus?\n\nThe longer the offensive continues and the worse the destruction gets, the more likely that a tide of civilians will try to escape.\n\nThe UN refugee agency's Iraq representative, Bruno Geddo, said last week that the exodus from Mosul could be \"one of the largest man-made displacement crises of recent times.\" They will need transport and basic necessities; and the Peshmerga and ISF will need to screen those leaving.\n\nJUST WATCHED Risking death to flee from ISIS Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Risking death to flee from ISIS 02:41\n\nThere is anxiety about suicide bombers -- especially teenage boys -- infiltrating the outflow. The ISF has already stated it won't allow civilians to leave in cars for fear of vehicle bombs.\n\nFrantic preparations are being made to prepare camps for as many as 700,000 people leaving Mosul -- but aid agencies can only guess how many will flee and in which directions.\n\nThe 11 camps completed or planned will only accommodate 120,000 people, according to the UNHCR. Geddo says that only a third of the $196 million budget required has been funded.\n\nRelief agencies are also dealing with people displaced by recent fighting south of Mosul, and expect as many as 100,000 to flee their homes as Iraqi and Kurdish forces close in on another ISIS pocket around the town of Hawija. There are already 3.3 million internally displaced people in Iraq.\n\nThere's also great concern among diplomats and Kurdish officials about plans for securing, stabilizing and governing Mosul once ISIS is evicted. US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a Senate committee last week that some 15,000 Sunni tribal elements are being trained and equipped to be the holding force once Mosul is liberated. \"We're well on track\" to meet that goal, he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Iraqi PM: We're preparing for months-long fight in Mosul Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iraqi PM: We're preparing for months-long fight in Mosul 09:02\n\nIn the longer run, integrating the various militia that have sprouted since Mosul fell to ISIS, devising better governance for the city, and making it liveable again, are challenges as great as liberating it in the first place.\n\nUS and Iraqi officials have spoken of creating eight self-governing areas in and around Mosul. Ever since Iraq's new constitution was passed, there's been much talk of local autonomy, but it's rarely been delivered. To many observers, Mosul will be the acid test of Iraq's viability -- and whether its complex mosaic of sectarian, tribal and ethnic groups can live in peace, if not harmony.",

It's unclear whether he's found love.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles Rams score a reality show with E!\n\nPlayers like Jerry Rice, John Elway and Bo Jackson have all turned to reality TV, appearing on shows like \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"Pros Vs.

Show.\" Like its star, the show was very dramatic.\n\n-- Like Kelce, Chad Ochocinco wanted to find love. The former wide receiver's show, \"The Ultimate Catch,\" had him pick a partner out of 85 women.\n\n-- Primetime himself, Deion Sanders, has had two of his own reality shows. The first was with his then-wife Pilar Sanders. The second, \"Deions' Family Playbook,\" aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network and gave fans a look at his life after retirement and the charter school he founded, Prime Prep Academy. (The school has since closed.)\n\n-- The Los Angeles Rams moved to a new city and landed two shows to document a new era for an old franchise: \"Hard Knocks\" and \"Hollywood & Football.\"",

His own beers soon caught people's attention.\n\nThree years on, he launched Sierra Nevada Brewing, named after his favorite hiking spot in the nearby mountains.\n\nBack then, large breweries dominated the U.S. market, producing mainly lagers.\n\n\"In 1980, there were roughly 45 companies making beer,\" Grossman says. \"It was pretty much the low point in the U.S. brewing industry after prohibition.\"\n\nSince then, the U.S. craft beer scene has exploded.\n\nRead: There's a bull market for ... beer!\n\nThere are now more breweries in the U.S. than ever before, and annual craft beer retail sales are worth about $22.3 billion, or roughly 12% of the market. The number of breweries operating in the U.S. grew 15% in 2015, with 620 opening and 68 closing, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nAnd Sierra Nevada has seen growth to match. It now produces 1.2 million barrels of beer annually from its two breweries.\n\nLast year, it brewed nearly 200 different beers (most were small-batch, draught-only releases) and sales grew by 17.3%. But its flagship Pale Ale still tops the charts, accounting for 49% of total sales.\n\n\"It's a fantastic beer and I drink it regularly. I always enjoyed that style of ale,\" says Grossman.\n\nArt and science\n\nNow 61, Grossman is a hands-on CEO, tasting new beers and working with a team of scientists designing and tweaking new recipes.\n\nInnovation aside, Grossman thinks it's his firm's commitment to tradition and high quality that keeps it growing.\n\n\"We maintain very much our original roots as far as what we brew and how we brew it,\" he says. \"It has obviously grown over the years, but we still maintain the same principles that we started with. I think the consumers and our peers respect that.\"\n\nSierra Nevada is expanding globally, and the brand is already popular in the U.K., Australia and Italy, Grossman says. \"The demand is there and we are increasing substantially in that area.\"\n\nAnd even after all these years, he hasn't lost his passion for brewing.\n\n\"I love the alchemy, the science, the flavors, the creativity,\" he says. \"There's just so much to like about making beer.\"",

His teams have won five national championships and advanced to the \"final-four\" of a national championship tournament nine consecutive years. He's been recognized three times as the national debate coach of the year. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Last night, Tim Kaine and Mike Pence took up their most public roles yet as surrogates for their leaders in the vice presidential debate.\n\nKnowing this, they each had three roles:\n\nFirst, defend the top of your ticket. Second, attack the top of the other ticket. Finally, prove you are capable of being president. Once I got past the interruptions, here's what I heard.\n\nDefend the top of your ticket\n\nTim Kaine: B+\n\nI thought the email attacks hit home , especially when Pence hammered away at the fact that it was dangerous for American security. Kaine's answer was only that it was not \"criminal.\" OK, but that's not really the point. He defended everything else pretty well, from the Clinton Foundation to the Iran deal. He was ready with the fact that Clinton apologized for the \" basket of deplorables\" line . Indeed, Kaine used the old backward-step-pivot-forward debating technique by turning this into an indictment of Trump's lack of apologies for anything.\n\nMike Pence: D-\n\nPence was clearly uncomfortable. This reminds me of so many debates my teams have had. In every debate, we are a team of two members. When one of my debaters is young or inexperienced, they make a lot of mistakes that the older member tries to overcome in the final speech.\n\nThat's precisely what happened here. Trump, in his stump speeches and the first presidential debate, was like my younger, inexperienced debaters, just saying things without thinking about the ramifications. Pence was like my seasoned veterans, trying to gloss over, re-explain, and even change the direction of the answers given by their partner.\n\nJUST WATCHED What Mike Pence thinks vs. What Donald Trump says Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What Mike Pence thinks vs. What Donald Trump says 02:14\n\nUnfortunately, it usually leads to double-turns. (A double-turn is when a team directly contradicts something they've said earlier.)\n\nSince Pence didn't want to contradict Trump, his only other option was silence. And it was painful to watch him getting hammered again and again by Kaine. Kaine even asked, \"How can you defend that?\" multiple times on these subjects:\n\n-- The Trump insult about John McCain and prisoners of war\n\n-- The Trump insult about the Indiana judge not being qualified because of his heritage\n\n-- The Trump birther nonsense\n\n-- The Trump claim that more countries getting nukes is a good thing\n\n-- The Trump argument questioning NATO and alliances\n\n-- Trump's (and Pence's) comments about how Vladimir Putin is a strong leader\n\n-- Trump's taxes\n\n-- Trump's line that Mexico is sending criminals, drug dealers and rapists across the border\n\nJUST WATCHED Reality check: Kaine claims Trump, Pence praised Putin Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Reality check: Kaine claims Trump, Pence praised Putin 01:38\n\nIn debate terms, Pence got \"spread out of the debate.\" There were too many attacks and he had too few answers for them. Plus, his heart wasn't there. Pence defended his own positions just fine; defending Trump was another thing.\n\nMultiple times, I thought he just gave up. He seemed frustrated, saying \"did you work on that for a long time?\" and \"don't put words in my mouth.\" Unfortunately, it was Trump who put the words there, and Trump's own words were Pence's undoing.\n\nAttack the top of the other ticket\n\nTim Kaine: A+\n\nMike Pence: B+\n\nKaine found the sweetest fruit to be the lowest hanging.\n\nFinally, immigration and deportation was debated. These were the attacks Pence at least tried to defend. The rest he tried to brush off and ignore, which left Kaine free to attack Trump at will.\n\nJUST WATCHED Poll: Mike Pence wins VP debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Poll: Mike Pence wins VP debate 00:52\n\nAs for Pence, he had his own good moments with criticisms of Clinton. He hammered the emails, the server, and our security several times. He was also pretty effective with his \"Clinton reset Russia\" argument (but honestly, I wish he'd spent 30 seconds explaining the term \"reset Russia\" and what, exactly, that meant).\n\nPence was also prepped to debate the lack of action by Obama and Clinton led to the creation of ISIS. Finally, he got to use the \"basket of deplorables\" line against Clinton and how she'd insulted too many people. All these were reasonable criticisms of Clinton that scored to some extent.\n\nBut in an emergency...\n\nTim Kaine: A-\n\nMike Pence: A-\n\nBoth candidates demonstrated the experience necessary to take over the role of president if needed. They both had detailed answers on questions ranging from the economy to their religious beliefs and abortion. Based on this debate only, yes, I think they are both qualified to be president. Not perfect, but qualified.\n\nOverall grade\n\nTim Kaine: B (I deducted a letter grade for excessive interrupting)\n\nMike Pence: C (Defending Trump isn't his forte)",

    "text": "Sheena Meredith is a doctor, writer and healthcare communications consultant. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\n(CNN) There are two major factors that influence life expectancy : smoking habits and weight. And they're heading in opposite directions.\n\nObesity -- dragged into the presidential race last week by Republican nominee Donald Trump -- is a bigger threat to health and linked to higher rates of chronic illness than smoking, problem drinking or poverty.\n\nThese two trends are not unconnected. The average tobacco quitter gains 11 or 12 pounds over the long run . Although the benefits of not smoking are calculated to offset damage from the increased risk of obesity, the obesity tide is eroding some of the gains in life expectancy from reduced smoking.\n\nObviously, therefore, physicians are enthusiastically advising their heavier patients to lose weight , hoping for the same success as they have achieved with smoking, right? Well, no. In fact, even when doctors inform patients that their body mass index (BMI) is too high, few offer constructive guidance about how to lose weight, citing barriers such as lack of time, training and confidence.\n\nAlthough physician advice can significantly boost the success of weight-loss efforts, the proportion of people receiving such advice has fallen . Even among patients consulting for obesity, physicians offer diet and nutrition education to only one in three.\n\nWhy is it that the public health approach applied so effectively to tobacco fails to translate to being overweight? Doctors have little hesitation about telling their smoking patients to quit, but a certain ambivalence seems to creep in when it comes to talking to patients about being overweight.\n\nThis is mirrored by official guidance. On smoking, the Surgeon General's advice to physicians is blunt: \"Talk to your patients. Tell them that quitting smoking is the most important step they can take to improve their health. They will listen to you .\"\n\nIn contrast, six pages of advice from the National Institutes of Health on talking to patients about weight loss describes obesity as a \"sensitive topic,\" advises speaking \"caringly,\" opening discussion \"in a respectful way\" and using the patient's preferred terms to describe being overweight.\n\nBeing overweight is less obviously a choice, and not a yes-no lifestyle issue where doctors can confidently say, \"just stop.\" Moreover, official guidelines on diet and weight are notoriously inconsistent, and environmental influences on weight are far more widespread.\n\nJUST WATCHED Clinton: Who gets up at 3 a.m. for a Twitter attack?

He eats buckets of fried chicken. He knows he should lose weight but his lifestyle gets in the way. He says he's always been overweight.\n\nIn other words, he's like an awful lot of Americans. So perhaps Trump is doing us a favour, making it fair game to talk about his size as a way to open discussions about obesity without upsetting those of a more sensitive disposition.",

    "text": "(CNN) From runway chic to psychedelic space cadet, flight attendants have worn a staggering variety of outfits in nearly nine decades in the air.\n\nUniforms were mandatory from the get-go, with the first flight attendants in the 1930s wearing reassuringly nurse-like kit to inspire confidence in plane passengers.\n\nNo, this space helmet didn't supply her with oxygen.\n\nSince then, uniforms over the years have woven together aviation history and vintage fashion, with female attendants regularly being at the forefront of popular imagination.\n\nSome uniforms were impractical, but memorable -- such as one airline that had its hostesses wear bright, candy-colored coats with bubble space helmets.\n\nThe problem was, they took up a lot of space in the overhead bins.\n\nOther uniforms have a sharp, ageless style that wouldn't look out of place on the runway today.\n\nThe SFO Museum at San Francisco International Airport 's new \"Fashion in Flight\" exhibition features 70 women's uniforms from 1930 to the present day and features work by designers including Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Ralph Lauren.\n\nThe pieces are on display throughout the International Terminal.\n\nEllen Church, the godmother of cabin crew\n\nSan Francisco was the logical place to host the show, because the world's first female flight attendant, Ellen Church, was hired in the city in 1930.\n\nChurch was a pilot and registered nurse. Boeing Air Transport (now defunct) wouldn't hire her as a pilot, but she did manage to persuade them that nurses could reassure passengers and attend to their needs if health issues occurred in flight.\n\n\"The uniforms have many demands on them,\" says John Hill, assistant director at SFO Museum, who curated the exhibit.\n\n\"It needs to have function, project an authority and identity while coupling it with fashion trends. It has to be current, appealing and eye-catching.\n\n\"It's a tremendous challenge and there are some brilliant successes.\"\n\nHere are some of the pieces on show at the SFO Museum, worn by the women who followed in Ellen Church's footsteps. Most of the pieces are from U.S. airlines.\n\n1930\n\nA United Airlines reproduction of a woolen uniform worn from 1930 to 1932.\n\nBoeing Air Transport -- later United Airlines -- was the first airline to have female flight attendants (the first male attendant was Heinrich Kubis, who began serving on German airships in 1912).\n\nThe uniform came in dark green wool with a heavy cape and cap. It might look like a cross between Florence Nightingale and Peter Pan -- but perhaps that's fitting to the attendant's role as a nurse figure gifted with the power of flight.\n\nAttendants wore block-heel Oxford brogues for stability, and with planes having to make landings to refuel, those capes helped keep them warm during pit stops.\n\n1939\n\nThis look was created for United Airlines by in-house designer Zay Smith.\n\nAs more flight attendants were hired by more airlines, their uniforms evolved.\n\nIn 1939, United Airlines departed from masculine, serious suits to a more sunny, cheerful look.\n\nThe uniform matched the color of the airline with a clean short-sleeve dress in white crepe and a navy wool jacket with puffed shoulders.\n\nThe above outfits were used for the airline's Douglas DC-3 service.\n\n1944: Howard Greer\n\nThis look by Hollywood fashion designer Howard Greer featured TWA lettering on the shoulder.\n\nWith World War II efforts under way, austerity affected the garment industry.\n\nWith less fabric available, outfits became more streamlined.\n\nDesigners opted for slimmer silhouettes, and the attire became decidedly more military in style.\n\n1959: Don Loper\n\nThis piece by Hollywood designer Don Loper celebrates the Jet Age with sharp, angular features.\n\nAs flight became more accessible for more people, the uniforms began to take on a more cheerful tone.\n\nTo celebrate flight, the Pan Am attendant uniform mimicked the shape of the jet.\n\nThis suit in Tunis blue has flares on the cuff, an angular cut and a fin motif, all in homage to the Jet Age.\n\n1965: Emilio Pucci\n\nEmilio Pucci captures the '60s in full swing.\n\nAs the free-wheeling 1960s rolled in, some airlines began doing away with the traditional suits.\n\nIn a bold move, now-defunct Braniff International Airways hired Italian designer Emilio Pucci to reimagine its stewardess outfits. In came bold prints, pastels and bursts of color that jolted the airline industry.\n\nAttendants wore bright green, striped calfskin boots, mini dresses, smocks, palazzo pants and nylon jerseys.\n\nThey were \"non-uniform uniforms\" but reflective of Braniff Airways' brand identity.\n\nOne of the most outlandish looks was a space bubble helmet that hostesses wore over their heads as passengers boarded the flight.\n\nThe helmets were not worn during flight, and they were inconvenient to store. But the Florentine designer was tipping his hat to the space age.\n\n1969: Cristobal Balenciaga\n\nThis winter suit for Air France was one of Cristobal Balenciaga's last works before closing his fashion house.\n\nFashion designer Cristobal Balenciaga demanded perfection when he partnered with Air France in the late '60s.\n\nHe wanted individual fittings because he didn't want to see ill-fitting uniforms, says SFO's John Hill.\n\nThe result was this bespoke, navy winter suit in woolen serge with flap pockets and a riding hat.\n\n1970: Hanae Mori\n\nThis Japan Airlines uniform incorporates two national symbols: a crane and the rising sun.\n\n1970 was the time of micro-mini skirts and laid-back California cool.\n\nThis uniform designed by Japan's Hanae Mori for Japan Air celebrated national symbols in both the red belt buckle -- the rising sun -- as well as a crane motif on the hat.\n\nThe dark blue polyester knit dress was a departure from JAL's earlier uniforms and yes, they're shorter.\n\n1980: Yves Saint Laurent\n\nYves Saint Laurent designed this jacket and dress combo with kangaroo print.\n\nWelcome to the era of \"Dynasty\" and shoulder pads.\n\nThis Qantas Airways uniform, designed by Yves Saint Laurent, featured a distinctive kangaroo pattern that could not be mistaken for any other airline.\n\nThe cropped jacket and giant shoulders make for a classic 1980s power suit.\n\n1990: Eastern Air Lines\n\nThis nostalgic look includes slacks, a midi-skirt, a matching blazer and a hat.\n\nThis look just screams uniform.\n\nEastern Air Lines (no longer in service) celebrated traditionalism in this design and brought back a retro hat invoking the golden age of air travel.\n\n2000: Christian Lacroix\n\nChristian Lacroix designed this robe-manteau dress with a Japanese-style tie belt.\n\nChristian Lacroix joined the long line of famous French designers including Pierre Cardin, Hermes and Dior who've created uniforms for France's national carrier, Air France.\n\nThe atelier designed over 100 pieces for the airline including this robe-style, wool-blend dress that was both chic and comfortable and came in navy and blue-gray.\n\n2014: Vivienne Westwood\n\nVivienne Westwood brought her aesthetic to Virgin Atlantic with this tailored suit.\n\nIn a world of muted uniforms, Virgin Atlantic's electric red uniform stands out.\n\nDesigned by Vivienne Westwood, the uniform has angular details and a jacquard blouse with a high collar and asymmetric frills. Even the buttons have small wings.\n\nYou can still see Virgin Atlantic attendants rock this outfit today.\n\nThe SFO Museum's \"Fashion in Flight\" exhibition runs until January 8, 2017.",

For the most part they are brutalist, utilitarian blocks that are built to house row after row of prison cells and which offer altogether dismal living conditions.\n\nBut a few disused penitentiaries have had their potential unlocked by redevelopers -- and in these second leases on life, former jails have been transformed into everything from luxury hotels to schools, shopping complexes, or even a film lot.\n\nOne 18th-century jail in Louviers, France, has been reincarnated as an elegant music academy. Its award-winning design features a modern glass orchestra hall juxtaposed above its classical stone facade.\n\nMeanwhile, the shuttered Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island in New York is in the process of becoming a studio for TV and film production in the hopes that celebrities, not convicts, will one day walk its grounds.\n\nMore and more former prison sites are being opened up to redevelopment in the US, thanks in no small part to the government's decision to move away from controversial for-profit prisons. The announcement in August that the US federal government would stop using private operators is expected to force many private facilities to close. That's alongside lower overall incarceration rates, that stem from a rejection of the old 1990's \"tough on crime\" stance.\n\nRead More",

The opinions in the article below belong to the author.\n\n(CNN) \"We came from wars and places where governments are threatening people,\" 20-year old Nasratullah, an asylum seeker fleeing violence in Afghanistan, told me last week. \"And then we came to Hungary and police beat us a lot. I want to know why they are doing this to us. We are not animals and we are not criminals.\"\n\nI met him days after Hungarian border officials beat him severely in late May, then pushed him back to the Serbian border.\n\nNasratullah is not alone. During the past two years, I have documented first-hand Hungary's response to the refugee crisis : the appalling conditions and overcrowding in camps, restrictive laws aimed at making it hard for asylum seekers to enter the country and obtain protection, and policies to make life as hard as possible for those who do.\n\nThe government doesn't just make life miserable for asylum seekers and refugees . It wants the Hungarians to hate them too. The government has relentlessly stirred up xenophobic sentiments against refugees and migrants by spewing hateful and misleading messages on billboards , in booklets, and on TV and radio nationwide. Anti-migrant rhetoric by decision makers and high-ranking public officials has become commonplace.\n\nAsylum seekers, migrants and refugees are called \"intruders\" and \"potential terrorists,\" and described as people who don't abide by laws and who are unable to integrate into Hungarian society. According to the distorted government-driven narrative, refugees pose a danger to Hungary's Christian values and traditions. In July, Prime Minister Viktor Orban himself referred to migration as \"poison.\"\n\nOn October 2, in contempt of that history, the government is holding a referendum asking Hungarians to reject an EU agreement to share responsibility for asylum seekers. Under the deal, Hungary, a country of some 10 million people, has been asked to take a mere 1,294 asylum seekers, but the government has objected to even this small number and is trying to overturn the deal in the EU Court of Justice.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the referendum, the taxpayer-funded anti-refugee campaign has intensified, with thousands of billboards across the country carrying hateful messages like \"Did you know? Brussels wants to forcibly resettle numbers of illegal migrants the size of a city into Hungary,\" and \"Did you know? From the beginning of the migration crisis, abuses against women in Europe have skyrocketed.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Police throw food to desperate refugees Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police throw food to desperate refugees 02:10\n\nIn August, the government distributed an 18-page booklet containing factual distortions and outright lies about migration and asylum to over four million Hungarian households. It links migration to increased terrorism and refers to non-existent \"no-go\" areas in European cities with large migrant populations, including London, Paris and Berlin, where it claims authorities have lost control, and law and order are absent.\n\nThe campaign has cost the Hungarian taxpayers the equivalent of over 16 million euros -- or approximately 12,000 euro per asylum seeker that Hungary has been asked to take. This money would be far better spent improving conditions in refugee camps and establishing integration support programs for refugees and asylum seekers in line with Hungary's obligations under international and EU law.\n\nWith Hungary's leaders encouraging hostility against asylum seekers, it is hardly surprising that its border officials show little humanity for those they actually encounter at the country's borders.\n\nJUST WATCHED Police throw food to desperate refugees Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police throw food to desperate refugees 02:10\n\nThose who cross the razor-wire fence that Hungary erected on its border with Serbia in September 2015 stand a very real risk of being pushed back to the Serbian border, often violently, as Nasratullah was. I have interviewed dozens of asylum seekers and migrants, including some women and children, with similar stories. They told me that border officials pummel them with fists, kick them, use pepper spray, and beat them with batons, often laughing all the while, then push them back to the border. The few investigations opened into the abuse have gone nowhere.\n\nNasratullah is now safe in Austria. But instead of fueling xenophobia and treating asylum seekers like him with contempt, Hungary's government should remind the country of its own history and create a more welcoming and humane attitude to those fleeing war and persecution who are seeking safety in Hungary today.",

Also, text highlights and a transcript of the discussion are below.\n\nMANDATORY CREDIT: CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\n\nContacts: Lauren Pratapas \u2014 Lauren.Pratapas@turner.com; 202.465.6666; Brooke Lorenz- Brooke.Lorenz@turner.com\n\nCNN STORY\n\nGiuliani: False claims about Clinton's marriage are 'fair game'\n\nGiuliani claims Trump 'a genius' for not paying taxes\n\nVIDEO HIGHLIGHTS\n\nRudy Giuliani full interview\n\nTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\n\nGiuliani on The New York Times report that Trump has not paid federal income taxes for 18 years: Well, all I have is \"The New York Times\" story to go by, so let me - let me comment on it as if it's true. First of all, what you failed to leave out of what you said - and it's not your fault - it's \"The New York Times\"' fault - is that this is perfectly legal. And \"The Times\" makes that point about 26 paragraphs into the opinion. Number two, \"The Times\" fails to point out that he has an obligation, as the head of a business, to take advantage of the tax advantages of and to use the lawful deductions and tax advantages that are available to you. I advise my clients to do that, because, if they don't do it, they get sued by their co-investors, by their investors, they lose jobs for their employees. And the reality is, this is rather common in large, gigantic American businesses, loss carry-forwards\u2026You might remember - you might remember, a few years ago, it was pointed out that GE paid no taxes\u2026So, the reality is, this is part of our tax code. The man is a genius. He knows how to operate the tax code for the benefit of the people he's serving.\n\nGiuliani on Americans paying income taxes: TAPPER: Well, that's interesting, because, Mr. Mayor, you say that he's a genius. Donald Trump said during the debate that not paying federal income taxes makes him smart. Does that mean that the rest of us who don't look for every possible loophole and provision to avoid paying our fair share of taxes, does that mean the rest of us are stupid? GIULIANI: No, absolutely not. In fact, 44 percent, 45 percent of America doesn't pay income tax. TAPPER: A lot of them are below the poverty line, not - they are not billionaires. They are below the poverty line, and they don't make enough to be taxed. GIULIANI: But someone told them that they - they - they don't have to pay taxes. And anybody that goes and has an accountant, H&R Block, or just goes online, figures out all the deductions available - available to them. I mean, the reality is that most Americans take advantage of every deduction available to them. And, of course. TAPPER: Most Americans pay federal income taxes, sir, and Donald Trump apparently did not. GIULIANI: No, just a little bit over most Americans pay federal income taxes. TAPPER: Yes, a majority of the American people pay federal income taxes. GIULIANI: And very - and very large businesses very often take advantage of these kinds of losses. Jake...\n\nGiuliani on if he pays federal income taxes: TAPPER: Do you pay federal income taxes? You're a successful businessman. Do you pay federal income taxes? GIULIANI: Well, that's between me and my accountant and the IRS. And the reality is, I pay my lawful tax, and he paid his lawful tax.\n\nGiuliani on Trump not releasing his tax return: TAPPER: He's the first - he's the first major party nominee since 1976 to not release his tax returns. If you're proud of that, that's great. But it - I don't think he should be. GIULIANI: And I am saying, the way all of you are treating this is a very good indication of why someone might not want to release their tax returns, because you take something that is perfectly legal, something he had no choice but to utilize - and if he didn't utilize it, he would have been in a lot of trouble - and you try to make it into - he did no wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has violated probably 30 federal statutes. He did nothing wrong. The headline should have been Donald Trump takes advantage of legal provisions in tax code. That's - that's the story. TAPPER: OK, that's an interesting - that's an interesting headline. I think most Americans are probably interested - most Americans pay their federal income taxes. Most Americans...GIULIANI: Well, I don't know. You don't know most Americans, and I don't know most Americans. TAPPER: I know that most Americans pay their federal income taxes, sir. Let me ask you something. In 2012... GIULIANI: I also know - I also know that most Americans take advantage of every deduction and every legal opportunity there is to save some taxes, so they don't have to pay as much as they are paying to the government\u2026And I know most Americans would - I know most Americans would rather be paying lower taxes than a Donald Trump and 10 percent or 20 percent more under Hillary Clinton.\n\nGiuliani on the Trump campaign spreading allegations that Hillary hasn\u2019t been loyal to Bill: TAPPER: Mr. Mayor, is that normal, stable behavior for a presidential nominee to launch an unsubstantiated attack? GIULIANI: Well, after - after she called him a racist and misogynist, a xenophobic, I don't know, schizophrenic, and I don't know what else she called him at the end of that debate, I think it's fair - it's fair game. TAPPER: Just to make stuff up, just to say wild accusations, Hillary Clinton is cheating on Bill, no proof of it whatsoever? Everything is fair game? GIULIANI: What - what - that was a sarcastic remark pointing out that Bill Clinton has, you know, quite a past, and Hillary Clinton has done quite a job on attacking the people who were victims of Bill Clinton. And not only that. She poses as a feminist, and she's taken money from countries that stone women, kill women, have women...TAPPER: Bill Clinton is not the nominee, sir. Bill Clinton is not the nominee. And this is my last question for you. GIULIANI: And he is...TAPPER: Is the Trump campaign - is Donald Trump and the people around Donald Trump really the ones to be casting aspersions on the marriages of anyone else? GIULIANI: It isn't a marriage. It isn't the marriage. It's the way she goes on the attack and tries to hurt victims of sexual predations. I mean, she's the one who says that victims should be taken seriously. TAPPER: That wasn't about her marriage? Him saying that she's not loyal to Bill isn't about her marriage? GIULIANI: I am saying the problem with Hillary Clinton has nothing to do, as far as I'm concerned, with her marriage. It's her protection of Bill Clinton for 20 or 25 years against allegations of rape, taking advantage of an intern, and going on the attack and trying to make those women appear to be insane in some cases. Also, it's her posing as a feminist and taking millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars, from countries that kill women, stone women, don't allow women to drive, don't allow women to have rights, use women as property. TAPPER: I just - I just - I - I mean, I just find it hard to believe that Mr. Trump would want to start leveling accusations about people's marriages. But that's all the time we have, Mr. Mayor. GIULIANI: I think the - I think the accusations are about Hillary Clinton taking money from countries that kill women. TAPPER: The accusation was that Hillary Clinton was cheating on Bill. That's what the accusation was. GIULIANI: That's\u2026TAPPER: It was an unhinged and wild accusation. I can understand why you can't defend it, because it's indefensible. Mayor Giuliani, thank you so much. I appreciate it. GIULIANI: Well, that's your opinion. And thank you for allowing me to reply to that.\n\nFULL TRANSCRIPT\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Jake Tapper.\n\nQuote: \"She's nasty, but I can be nastier than she ever can be.\"\n\nThat's what Donald Trump told \"The New York Times\" this weekend. And then he proved it at a rally last night.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She can't make it 15 feet to her car.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Give me a break.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Give me a break.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: While he was working that crowd, \"The New York Times\" published a story revealing that the paper had seen pages from Donald Trump's 1995 tax returns, which suggested a near-billion-dollar loss, a deduction so huge, it could have allowed Trump to not pay any federal income taxes for as long as 18 years.\n\nWe have lots to talk about with top Trump adviser and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who joins me now live from New York.\n\nMr. Mayor, thanks for being here.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: No, thank you very much, Jake. Nice to be with you.\n\nTAPPER: So, Mr. Mayor I have got to start with this bombshell report in \"The New York Times\" that Donald Trump may have avoided federal income taxes for almost a generation.\n\nIs your campaign disputing the authenticity of these documents from Donald Trump's 1995 tax returns that was mailed by an anonymous source?\n\nGIULIANI: Well, all I have is \"The New York Times\" story to go by, so let me - let me comment on it as if it's true.\n\nFirst of all, what you failed to leave out of what you said - and it's not your fault - it's \"The New York Times\"' fault - is that this is perfectly legal. And \"The Times\" makes that point about 26 paragraphs into the opinion.\n\nNumber two, \"The Times\" fails to point out that he has an obligation, as the head of a business, to take advantage of the tax advantages of and to use the lawful deductions and tax advantages that are available to you. I advise my clients to do that, because, if they don't do it, they get sued by their co-investors, by their investors, they lose jobs for their employees.\n\nAnd the reality is, this is rather common in large, gigantic American businesses, loss carry-forwards.\n\nTAPPER: But - but, Mr...\n\nGIULIANI: You might remember - you might remember, a few years ago, it was pointed out that GE paid no taxes.\n\nTAPPER: Yes.\n\nGIULIANI: So, the reality is, this is part of our tax code.\n\nThe man is a genius. He knows how to operate the tax code for the benefit of the people he's serving.\n\nTAPPER: Well, that's interesting, because, Mr. Mayor, you say that he's a genius.\n\nDonald Trump said during the debate that not paying federal income taxes makes him smart. Does that mean that the rest of us who don't look for every possible loophole and provision to avoid paying our fair share of taxes, does that mean the rest of us are stupid?\n\nGIULIANI: No, absolutely not.\n\nIn fact, 44 percent, 45 percent of America doesn't pay income tax.\n\nTAPPER: A lot of them are below the poverty line, not - they are not billionaires. They are below the poverty line, and they don't make enough to be taxed.\n\nGIULIANI: But someone told them that they - they - they don't have to pay taxes.\n\nAnd anybody that goes and has an accountant, H&R Block, or just goes online, figures out all the deductions available - available to them.

And, of course...\n\nTAPPER: Most Americans pay federal income taxes, sir, and Donald Trump apparently did not.\n\nGIULIANI: No, just a little bit over most Americans pay federal income taxes.\n\nTAPPER: Yes, a majority of the American people pay federal income taxes.\n\nGIULIANI: And very - and very large businesses very often take advantage of these kinds of losses. Jake...\n\nTAPPER: Do you pay federal income taxes? You're a successful businessman. Do you pay federal income taxes?\n\nGIULIANI: Well, that's between me and my accountant and the IRS. And the reality is, I pay my lawful tax, and he paid his lawful tax.\n\nTAPPER: Well, let me ask you another question, sir.\n\nDonald Trump has...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGIULIANI: And, Jake - no, no, no, Jake, wait a second. This is really very unfair.\n\nIf he didn't take advantage of those tax deductions or tax advantages that he had, he could be sued, because he - his obligation, as a businessman, is to make money for his enterprise and to save money for his enterprise. It would have been insane for him to take advantage of them.\n\nTAPPER: Sued by whom? Who would sue him for his own personal income taxes?\n\nGIULIANI: Investors in his business, people who loan money to his business, banks that loan money to his business.\n\nIf I have a $200 million loss carry-forward that I can use, and I don't lose - and I don't use - use it, and I end up costing my company $200 million more, don't you think a bank that I borrowed money from is going sue me for mismanaging my business.\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Mayor, let me ask you another question.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Donald Trump, his pitch is...\n\nGIULIANI: That's why you are - that's why the simplistic analysis of an extraordinary, complex code is so unfair. The reality...\n\nTAPPER: I think that there are a lot of very, very successful business men and women who pay federal income taxes and don't look for every single opportunity there is to avoid paying them.\n\nBut let me ask you another question. Donald Trump has been selling himself as a brilliant businessman.\n\nGIULIANI: Wait a second, Jake. Wait a second. No, no.\n\nTAPPER: He has been selling himself as a brilliant businessman.\n\nGIULIANI: No, wait a second.\n\nTAPPER: He lost almost a billion dollars in 1995.\n\nGIULIANI: You got to let me - you got to - you got to - there are not very many smart businessmen who don't take advantage of the tax - legal tax laws that are there.\n\nAnd if they are, then they are not very good businessmen, and no one wants to go into business with them. They don't have very good lawyers and they don't have very good accountants.\n\nTAPPER: OK.\n\nBut, let me ask you, sir, he's selling himself as a brilliant businessman. He lost almost a billion dollars in 1995.\n\nGIULIANI: Correct.\n\nTAPPER: That doesn't sound particularly brilliant to me.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, yes it does.\n\nTAPPER: It does?\n\nGIULIANI: Since he came back. Since he came back. And he came all the way back.\n\nAnd isn't that the history of America? I mean, people like Steve Jobs were fired - was fired by Apple and came all the way - and came all the way back. Churchill was thrown out of office twice and came all the way back.\n\nIt shows what a genius he is. It shows he was able to preserve his enterprise and then he was able to build it. And the idea that he could carry it forward for 18 years means that at no time in 18 years did he make $916 million.\n\nAnd, of course, we know, last year, he made $685 million. We know that from his financial disclosure form.\n\nTAPPER: But he hasn't released his tax returns. The only reason we know anything about this is because somebody released this to \"The New York\" - somebody leaked this to \"The New York Times.\"\n\nGIULIANI: No.\n\nWe know - we know that he made $680 million last year from his 104-page financial disclosure form...\n\nTAPPER: All right, Mr. Mayor...\n\nGIULIANI: ... which - which describes considerably more about his finances than the tax return. And the reason...\n\nTAPPER: He's the first - he's the first major party nominee since 1976 to not release his tax returns. If you're proud of that, that's great. But it - I don't think he should be.\n\nGIULIANI: And I am saying, the way all of you are treating this is a very good indication of why someone might not want to release their tax returns, because you take something that is perfectly legal, something he had no choice but to utilize - and if he didn't utilize it, he would have been in a lot of trouble - and you try to make it into - he did no wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary Clinton has violated probably 30 federal statutes. He did nothing wrong. The headline should have been Donald Trump takes advantage of legal provisions in tax code. That's - that's the story.\n\nTAPPER: OK, that's an interesting - that's an interesting headline. I think most Americans are probably interested - most Americans pay their federal income taxes. Most Americans...\n\nGIULIANI: Well, I don't know. You don't know most Americans, and I don't know most Americans.\n\nTAPPER: I know that most Americans pay their federal income taxes, sir.\n\nLet me ask you something. In 2012...\n\nGIULIANI: I also know - I also know that most Americans take advantage of every deduction and every legal opportunity there is to save some taxes, so they don't have to pay as much as they are paying to the government.\n\nTAPPER: In 2012...\n\nGIULIANI: And I know most Americans would - I know most Americans would rather be paying lower taxes than a Donald Trump and 10 percent or 20 percent more under Hillary Clinton.\n\nTAPPER: OK.\n\nMr. Mayor, in 2012, Donald Trump tweeted: \"Half of Americans don't pay income tax, despite crippling government debt.\"\n\nHe is in that half that does not pay federal income taxes, despite crippling government debt. When he rails against the junky infrastructure, when he rails against La Guardia Airport, when he talks about how bridges are collapsing, is he not responsible, at least in part, for the fact that these things are not being repaired?\n\nGIULIANI: No. No.\n\nTAPPER: He's not at all?\n\nGIULIANI: Absolutely not.\n\nTAPPER: Not at all? No?\n\nGIULIANI: The law is responsible for it.\n\nIf you have a sensitivity laws, you live by those laws. And the reality is, you are ignoring completely the fiduciary obligation that he has to all the people around him to run his business at the lowest possible expense.\n\nEvery businessman takes advantage of it, including Warren - Warren Buffett. And Warren Buffett think we should be paying 90 percent in taxes. So, why doesn't he voluntarily send in that extra 40 percent? Let him voluntarily make out a check and send it in if that's what - he does exactly the same thing. He takes advantage of the law.\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Mayor, I have one last question for you.\n\nDonald Trump launched a wild and unsubstantiated attack against Hillary Clinton last night. Take listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, you want to know the truth.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: And, really, folks, really, why should she be, right?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Mayor, is that normal, stable behavior for a presidential nominee to launch an unsubstantiated attack?\n\nGIULIANI: Well, after - after she called him a racist and misogynist, a xenophobic, I don't know, schizophrenic, and I don't know what else she called him at the end of that debate, I think it's fair - it's fair game.\n\nTAPPER: Just to make stuff up, just to say wild accusations, Hillary Clinton is cheating on Bill, no proof of it whatsoever?

    "text": "Demetria Lucas D'Oyley is a contributor to theGrio and the author of \" Don't Waste Your Pretty : The Go-to Guide for Making Smarter Decisions in Life & Love.\" Follow her on Twitter: @abelleinbk . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) Deadline's TV editor Nellie Andreeva created a stir with her latest column , originally titled \"Pilots 2015: The Year of Ethnic Castings -- About Time or Too Much of Good Thing,\" and now headlined simply \"Pilots 2015: The Year Of Ethnic Castings.\"\n\nIn the piece she suggests that television may have gotten too diverse and that blacks may now be overrepresented on cable and broadcast television programs.\n\nAndreeva says some wonder, in this \"sea of change\" if \"the pendulum might have swung a bit too far in the opposite direction.\" This is like wondering if there are too many kids with high SAT scores at college, too many women in the workforce or too many gays getting married.\n\nMy grandpa was born in 1922 and was nearly 30 by the time the first black TV show, \"Amos 'n' Andy,\" debuted in 1951. He didn't have a television set at the time, just a radio.\n\nMy mom says he bought a black-and-white TV for the family in the early '60s. His favorite TV shows were the news and anything with \"colored people\" on it. He'd sit in his favorite chair, flipping through maybe six channels, stopping excitedly on whatever channel showed the rare black face.\n\nFrom \"The Flip Wilson Show,\" \"Good Times,\" \"The Jeffersons\" and \"Sanford and Son\" in the '70s, to \"The Cosby Show,\" \"A Different World\" and \"Amen\" in the '80s, he was enthralled. In the '90s, a heyday of black folk on TV, he just went overboard, because he could. Grandpa's downtime was packed with \"The Steve Harvey Show,\" \"Hangin' With Mr. Cooper\" and \"Living Single.\" He couldn't get enough of black faces.\n\ntheGrio.com: State senator who stood by SAE frat member is no 'Uncle Tom' or hero State senator who stood by SAE frat member is no 'Uncle Tom' or hero\n\nToday I watch, and occasionally hate-watch -- the act of watching a show where the lead characters drive you nuts -- \"Scandal,\" \"Empire,\" \"How to Get Away With Murder\" and \"Being Mary Jane\" nearly every week.\n\nLike my grandfather I can't get enough, not only of black faces but my options of them. There are finally enough black people on TV that I can skip a couple of predominately black shows and not feel bad about not \"supporting.\"\n\nI no longer feel obligated to watch the bad black show just because it's got black people. (Yes, many black people think this way.) This freedom is what I imagine white people feel like except they can always, at any time of day, any day of the week, any month of the year and in any year since the dawn of television -- including today -- turn on the television and see their faces and culture reflected. I still have designated nights.\n\nBut this is progress, however, small it might be. Diversity on TV is worth celebrating, even if Andreeva, feels \"ethnic\" people have overrun television like Atlanta zombies in \"The Walking Dead.\" This year is one of the first since the '90s, where black folk can flip around from channel to channel on an occasional night and see a variety of themselves.\n\nFrom ghetto fabulous (Taraji Henson as Cookie Lyon and Terrence Howard as Lucious Lyon) to beyond bourgeoisie (Gabrielle Union as Mary Jane) to conniving and complicated (Viola Davis as Annalise Keating) to so damn confusing (Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope), black thespians, black actresses, especially, have been making big waves in prime time despite their minuscule numbers. Yes, minuscule. Two to three predominately black shows per network -- and I'm being very generous -- per week isn't domination; it's an introduction to the possibilities. And while I'm loving this start, it seems Andreeva isn't.\n\ntheGrio.com: Liking blacks on TV so long as it's not 'too much' Liking blacks on TV so long as it's not 'too much'\n\nAnother concern of hers is that \"there has been a significant number of parts designated as ethnic this year, making them off-limits for Caucasian actors.\" Oh, the horror! White actors whose faces have been overrepresented on television since its origins are losing (some of) their exclusivity and privilege and must (finally) make (just a little) room for people with more melanin.\n\nI'm curious as to exactly what will happen because there are people of color taking up an exaggerated \"half\" the roles for new shows. Will white actors starve in the streets of Hollywood? Will white viewers stop watching TV because you know, relating to a character or family \"of color\" must somehow be impossible for them? Will white people stop winning nearly all the acting awards? The end is nigh.\n\nAndreeva asserts that the market for ethnic shows has reached its saturation point among black viewers. \"(African-Americans) were grossly underserved,\" she writes. \"But now, with shows such as 'Empire', 'Black-ish,' 'Scandal' and 'HTGAWM' on broadcast, Tyler Perry's fare on OWN and Mara Brock Akil's series on BET, they have scripted choices, so the growth in that fraction of the TV audience might have reached its peak.\"\n\nHold up. There are dozens of shows on TV at any given moment, and no one wonders if white people will ever get tired of watching white people. But black people get a half-dozen scripted shows in one season, and Andreeva thinks the black audience is at capacity. Did she bother to ask a black person about this instead of assuming for an entire TV audience she clearly knows nothing about? Because no one black and self-respecting is spent.\n\nThis season of programming has been a good start, and the lengthy list of pilots with faces of color detailed in Andreeva's exhausting article, sounds promising, and fun, and after a long wait, progress. My grandfather would be pleased.",

    "text": "(CNN) The Secretary of Explaining Stuff sometimes explains stuff a little too well.\n\nBill Clinton, who earned his nickname from President Barack Obama after making a resounding case for his 2012 candidacy, is facing heat after showing the flip side of his political genius.\n\nSpeaking at a Democratic rally this week in Flint, Michigan, Clinton offered a frank assessment of problems with the health care law that is Obama's signature domestic achievement, calling it \" the craziest thing in the world .\"\n\nClinton later sought to clean up the comments, but the resulting storm is renewing a debate that has flared throughout Hillary Clinton's political career: Is the 42nd President his wife's best asset or biggest distraction? Or both?\n\nRepublicans, including Donald Trump, seized on the Obamacare remarks to claim that Clinton is his wife's worst surrogate, seeking to drive a wedge between Obama supporters and the current Democratic nominee who badly needs their votes.\n\nPhotos: Bill Clinton's life and career Photos: Bill Clinton's life and career Bill Clinton served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001.

After all, it was not the first time he veered off message during the 2016 campaign.\n\nHis decision this summer to stride across the runway at the Phoenix airport to greet Attorney General Loretta Lynch sparked accusations he was trying to compromise the Justice Department's probe into his wife's private email server. Days of unflattering headlines and memories of Clinton's past scandals followed.\n\nClinton also got into a fiery back-and-forth about criminal justice with a protestor at a rally in Philadelphia in another counter-productive moment.\n\nAllegations of ethical wrongdoing, and ghosts of his past infidelities, as well as more recent questions about the management of the Clinton Foundation, have given ammunition to Republicans keen to sideline the former president.\n\nAll of this doesn't just add fuel to questions about Clinton's campaign role.

Hide Caption 55 of 55\n\n\"So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world,\" Clinton said.\n\nAlthough he tried to walk back his remarks on Tuesday and Wednesday, Republicans took the words \"crazy\" and \"craziest\" from his larger argument to proclaim Clinton just ripped into Obama's proudest achievement.\n\nOn Wednesday in Ohio, Bill Clinton moderated his language on Obamacare but did not dilute his point.\n\n\"I strongly supported that bill, and it's given more than 20 million people more insurance,\" Clinton said. \"But there are problems with it. There are problems with it, and everybody knows it.\"\n\nStatement of fact\n\nIt might have been a political gaffe. But Clinton's comment was a simple statement of a fact that everybody in politics understands.\n\nIf Obamacare is to work and survive, like many laws after they are enacted, it must be adjusted for prevailing economic and social conditions. But with Republicans -- who voted more than 50 times to repeal the law -- in control of Congress, there is no chance of a simple overhaul.\n\nThat means the law's fate depends on who wins in November.\n\nIn that sense, Clinton's remarks, though they might have infuriated the White House, likely infuriated congressional Democrats running for re-election and embarrassed his wife's campaign, could represent an effort to create political distance for his wife at a time of rising premiums and deductibles that are coming due just as voters go to the polls.\n\n\"He can be colorful but I think that really hit the point he was making, which is we've got to keep what's good and we've got to fix the problems,\" Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta said on \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\" this week.\n\nIndeed, the \"good\" Bill Clinton that can be a political gift to the campaign comes as a package with the undisciplined version. Patrick Maney, a Boston College historian who recently published a book about the Clinton presidency, which he dubbed \"A New Gilded Age,\" disputed the idea that the Obamacare comments were a gaffe.\n\n\"He will do things and you think he has lost a step and you think, 'Boy that was not a smart thing to do.' But then you think about it, you realize there is a really astute political mind at work there,\" Maney said.\n\nPositive role\n\nThe latest Obamacare spat aside, it is easy to overlook the fact that Clinton actually has played a more positive role in the 2016 campaign than in his wife's bitter 2008 race against Obama. The former president's role in a racially charged, losing primary race with Obama left deep political wounds on all sides.\n\nBut in politics, if not in life, Clinton learns from his mistakes.\n\nThere has been no repeat of the competing power centers loyal to Clinton and his wife that were ruinous to her primary effort in 2008. And despite a few controversies, he's mostly been an effective behind-the-scenes player.\n\n\"From everything I can tell, President Clinton has always been a good soldier to the best of his ability,\" said Joe Conason, author of the new book \"Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton.\" \"It is not that he never makes a mistake but he does mostly what he is asked to do to the best of his ability.\"\n\nFollowing his controversial comments in the 2008 primary that were seen as a racially charged dismissal of Obama, Clinton spent years repairing his ties with South Carolina Democrats and other African American leaders. That helped build Hillary Clinton's unassailable Democratic bastion among black voters in 2016, which helped her build a wall against Bernie Sanders in the South during the primaries.\n\nAfter a few frosty years, Bill Clinton accepted the olive branch offered by Obama and made the case for the nation's first African-American President's re-election during the 2012 Democratic National Convention in a way that Obama was unable to do for himself.\n\nThe snapshot of current relations between the two presidents came last week when Clinton dawdled at the foot of the stairs to Air Force One at the Tel Aviv airport after the funeral of former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama shouts to Bill Clinton at Air Force One: 'Let's go!' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama shouts to Bill Clinton at Air Force One: 'Let's go!' 01:15\n\n\"Bill, let's go!\" Obama cried from the top of the steps, his face a picture of combined exasperation, affection and amusement.\n\nRole reversal\n\nThe Clinton-Obama rapprochement has had real results in 2016. In fact, it sparked a role reversal, with Obama and his wife, Michelle, returning the favor to become the most prominent surrogates for Hillary Clinton's election. Obama's growing popularity -- a CNN/ORC poll released Thursday found his approval rating at 55%, the highest mark of his second term -- lends Hillary Clinton significant credibility in key Democratic blocs.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton may have been less prominent in the 2016 campaign, he has been as busy as ever, heading to places like Youngstown, Ohio, where Trump's populism threatens to eat into Democratic vote counts.\n\nEach event is a chance to enthuse and register Democrats and spreads the campaign to places the candidate herself cannot always reach.\n\nHis gaffes might make headlines but his influence is not always in the news.\n\nConason says that on the same day as the showdown with the protestor in Philadelphia made waves, Bill Clinton enjoyed a rapturous welcome in the city from influential African Methodist Episcopal bishops from across the nation.\n\n\"His speech to them was full of scripture and exhortation and stories about his wife and really nothing about him. He had them on their feet. They all went home, they did what they needed to do for him,\" Conason said.\n\nClinton is just as tireless on the campaign trial as he was when he first ran for the office almost a quarter century ago. His white mane may be thinning and the skin hangs more loosely around his neck, but he was in top form in Ohio Wednesday, characteristically waving his thin index finger and holding small crowds in thrall.\n\nHis speeches are packed with folksy anecdotes about people he meets on the trail, along with issues like energy, college financing, economic policy and retraining. He connects each of these points to a plan his wife is proposing to enact should they call the White House home again.\n\nOn Wednesday, Clinton complained that such nuts and bolts policy never gets an airing in the debates, in a barbed comment about a campaign in which his 1990s style conversational politics has sometimes seemed a throwback.\n\n\"It doesn't do well on Twitter! No one is foaming at the mouth!\" Clinton said. \"I am joking. But I am not.\"",

    "text": "Filmmakers Rod Blackhurst and Brian McGinn can't remember the exact moment when they decided to do a documentary about Amanda Knox, but it was sometime around 2011.\n\nAt that point, it was about four years after British college student Meredith Kercher was killed in an Italian villa she shared with her American roommate Knox. It was a four-year-old story that was still making front page news.\n\n\"For us that was just a confusing thing. We couldn't understand how coverage had stayed this popular for something that was at its heart a tragedy,\" McGinn told CNN. \"Terrible murders like this disappear from the news after a cycle or two, but this was something that really hung around.\"\n\nThe reason, he said, is that the case had -- over the course of the long and winding proceedings -- become personal. The lives of the victim and the accused had been exposed, their online identities woven into narratives and coverage of the case had largely strayed from facts of the crime. Instead, key figures were turned into \"accidentally celebrities.\"\n\nMuch like how the O.J. Simpson case is seen as one of the first instances of \"trial as entertainment,\" Knox's legal proceedings were the first instance of a trial becoming a \"social media extravaganza,\" McGinn said.\n\n\"It had gotten so far away from the bare essentials of the story,\" McGinn said. \"We thought there was something interesting there that not only we could explore from a first person perspective, but also examine the larger phenomenon of these stories in our society.\"\n\nAmanda Knox initially turned down their offer to speak for the documentary. For a moment, they thought their film hopes were dashed. They had only wanted to tell a first-person narrative.\n\nBut after her second conviction in 2014, Knox changed her mind. (In the film, available on Netflix starting Friday, there is footage of Knox celebrating her exoneration in 2015.)\n\n\"After that, that sort of opened the flood gates a little bit,\" McGinn said.\n\nKnox, her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, Italian prosecutor Giuliano Mignini and journalist Nick Pisa, who covered the story for The Daily Mail, are among those interviewed.\n\nEveryone featured in the documentary got to see it before the public. After having their stories controlled by the media for so long, Blackhurst said, \"it was important for each of them to know that the version of them in this film was in their own words and representative of who they were as people.\"\n\nThey believe their mission was accomplished.\n\nThey were also pleased to see their subjects respond to the stories of the other people featured. Knox, for example, hadn't known that Mignini -- a man she knew as an adversary -- had four daughters.\n\n\"[The interviewees] were all marked at how they learned something about the other people involved in this story that they [didn't know]. They hadn't maybe considered them as human beings before,\" Blackhurst said. \"They saw [each other] as a character in the same way they all became characters in the larger narrative.\n\nBlackhurst said they hope the film clears the air for the subjects but also makes viewers \"consider the role that they play in the commodification of tragedy.\"\n\n\"We want people to consider how they consume these types of stories and how they turn these real people and real situations into entertainment,\" he said.",

Most Democrats, including Maloney, opposed the move, blasting Republicans for raiding a preventative care fund in President Obama\u2019s health care law, in order to pay for their bill, accusing those across the aisle of going after women, yet again.\n\nBut when Anderson pointed out Democrats, including Maloney, dipped into that very same fund to pay for an extension of the payroll tax cut earlier this year, things got a little heated. Additionally, the prevention fund does not appear to specifically target women\u2019s health, rather, it paints in much broader brushstrokes. As Maloney points out, the preventative measures funded in the health care bill do benefit women and their families.\n\nBut if Democrats have raided this fund before, and if the fund does not specifically target women\u2019s health programs, can you really call what Republicans did Friday a \u201cwar on women\u201d?",

And it's too soon to pinpoint the exact path the storm will take as it heads northwest.\n\nBut here's one way to think about what could happen: Comparing the projected track of Hurricane Matthew with past hurricanes that traveled a similar path and hit the United States.\n\nMatthew was packing 120 mph winds as the Category 3 storm headed toward the Bahamas on Wednesday.\n\nThe latest projections indicate it could make landfall in Florida on Friday morning as a major hurricane.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "Elon Musk said Tuesday that a self-sustaining colony of people could be living on Mars within 50 to 150 years.\n\nThe SpaceX CEO laid out his plan to colonize the Red Planet at the International Astronautical Congress, a meeting of multiple international space exploration associations in Guadalajara, Mexico.\n\nMusk has long said he wants to make humans an \"interplanetary species,\" and on Tuesday he addressed many of the technical, safety and cost challenges he'll face.\n\nHis goal is to bring the price of a ticket to Mars down to around $200,000 per person -- about the median price of a house in the U.S. Compare that to $10 billion, which is what Musk said it would cost to go to Mars using current technology.\n\nHe explained that a few crucial technical advancements must be made to make that price point possible, including making rockets that are reliably reusable.\n\nSpaceX has already been heavily focused on that. The company has successfully landed six rockets that completed missions to orbit, and it intends to send one of those \"used\" rockets back into orbit later this year.\n\nRelated: SpaceX plans return to space by November, 3 months after blast\n\nOn the technical front, Musk has already introduced the world to the Raptor rocket engine he plans to use to take people to Mars, which is different that the engines used for the Falcon rockets that SpaceX has already sent on missions. The Raptor uses a different fuel and is far more powerful. The company completed a successful test fire of a Raptor rocket on Monday.\n\nMusk said a spacecraft headed to Mars would need to use 42 Raptor engines at once\n\n\"You could lose multiple engines,\" he said Tuesday, \"and continue the mission safely.\"\n\nThe initial goal is to pair the enormous rocket with a spaceship capable of carrying about 100 people (plus their luggage.)\n\nWay Up There: Explore the future of space travel\n\nHe admits \"not too many people\" will want to head to Mars at first. But on the bright side, he says there will be plenty of jobs.\n\n\"Mars would have a labor shortage for a long time,\" he added.\n\nOnce people are on Mars, Musk said they'll be able to grow crops in contained buildings with compressed atmosphere. They'll also have the resources they need to make more rocket fuel -- allowing them to send spaceships back to Earth.\n\nAbout an hour before Musk took the stage to unveil his master Mars plan, a video depicting an artificial rendering of SpaceX's \"Interplanetary Transport System\" was posted to YouTube.\n\nMusk has already said he wants to make the first unmanned trip to Mars before 2018. Next, he wants to send the first humans to Mars in 2024, with the spacecraft touching down in 2025.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk says astronauts would have been safe in the blast\n\nAnd since Mars and Earth only line up enough to execute a launch once every 26 months, he said it'll take about 40 to 100 years to make all the trips required to get a sustainable colony of people up and running.\n\nOf course, Musk is known for being overly optimistic with his deadlines, and admitted as much on Tuesday. \"Timelines,\" he said, \"I'm not the best at this sort of thing.\"",

    "text": "Driving in Louisiana? Caution: rough roads ahead.\n\nReader's Digest once ranked Bayou State roads the worst in the nation -- 50th among all states -- when they looked at spending, congestion, road and bridge condition, and safety.\n\nLast year, the US Transpiration Department said 62 percent of Louisiana roads were in poor to mediocre condition. It's one of 14 states to have 60 percent or more.\n\nSo how can Louisiana improve roads? The better question is, how much is Louisiana willing to spend, and willing to take from you?\n\nThere's one plan to pump in hundreds of millions of higher taxes from Louisiana drivers.\n\nThe lower prices we're seeing at the pump won't be as low if a plan from the governor's task force goes through. It would double the state's fuel tax to pay for major road projects.\n\nRight now in Louisiana, we're paying 20 cents a gallon state fuel tax. So the proposal would double that to 40 cents a gallon.\n\n\"That's too much,\" German Gutierrez said as he filled up gas cans. \"It's going to be too much. It's already costing us too much.\"\n\nLisa Welby says the state should raise tax dollars from elsewhere.\n\n\"People have to get to and from work. It's a necessity,\" Welby says about fuel. \"Lottery, beer, cigarettes are not necessities. I always think those are the three things that should be taxed before anything else should be taxed.\"\n\nBut others say they're okay with a gas tax hike.\n\n\"Gotta get it from some place. Why not get it from there?\" Jim Miller said as he finished gassing up his SUV. \"People are using the gas. So they ought to have to pay for it.\"\n\nMotorist and attorney Ransdell Keene says higher gas taxes are fine with one condition.\n\n\"As long as it's dedicated (for roads). I'm in favor of any dedicated expenditure,\" Keene says.\n\nDoubling the state gas tax would raise an estimated $600 million dollars per year. That would start making a dent in the state's long list of so-called\n\nMegaprojects. There are 113 of them.\n\nThe top 20 in priority would cost $4.8 billion.\n\nSuch projects in our area include widening the Red River bridge on I-20 to six lanes, and also widening Benton Road from I-20 to I-220 to six lanes.\n\n\"We have got to have new money,\" says Shreveport Rep. Barbara Norton, who is on the House Transportation Committee. \"We're at a standstill right now where the only options that are on the table right now are the options to do a tax with the gas tax.\"\n\nBut raising the gas tax may not be the only option that's presented to the governor. It's just one of the most controversial. DOTD secretary Shawn Wilson, who is also co-chair on the governor's task force, said in a statement to KTBS 3 News in part, \"The task force is receiving numerous recommendations ... regarding how best to invest in transportation. All funding options are on the table.\"\n\nCould that include spending cuts from elsewhere? Norton says special budget sessions may've cut the budget to the bone. So navigating a funding formula for new and improved roads in Louisiana could be a bumpy ride.\n\nThe task force on transportation infrastructure plans to deliver its recommendation to Governor John Bel Edwards at the start of next year. Another member, Ken Naquin, is also CEO of Louisiana Associated General Contractors. He says Louisiana has the third-lowest fuel tax in the country.",

Another crashed into the Pentagon. The fourth crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people were killed.\n\nYet, for all their tactical success the 9/11 attacks failed strategically and, in the end, achieved precisely the opposite of what Osama bin Laden had intended.\n\nThere are, of course, differences between the post-World War II era and the post 9/11 era. The long-term aftermath of Pearl Harbor was not only a decisive Allied victory in the war but also decades of American leadership and dominance.\n\nAfter its initial success in Afghanistan following 9/11, victory was not decisive for the United States. Instead, American forces continued to be at war with a number of shadowy jihadist groups, most recently ISIS, and this now seems like a quasi-permanent state of affairs that could persist well beyond the next presidency.\n\nWhen Congress passed the Authorization for the Use of Military Force immediately after the 9/11 attacks, no one could have imagined this authorization would continue to be the basis for American wars that persist a decade and a half later.\n\nBin Laden's hope\n\nOsama bin Laden fervently hoped that attacking the United States would create pressure on American leaders to reduce their support for Middle Eastern regimes. Bin Laden believed that without that American support the Arab regimes would collapse and would be replaced by Taliban-style rulers.\n\nIn particular, bin Laden wanted to put pressure on the United States to pull its troops out of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, bin Laden's principal political goal was to overthrow the Saudi royal family.\n\nOn a video that was released four weeks after 9/11, bin Laden made his first public statement since the attacks on New York and Washington, saying \"neither America nor the people who live in it will dream of security before we live it in Palestine, and not before all the infidel armies leave the land of Muhammad [Saudi Arabia].\"\n\nThe video was poorly timed, as it came out on October 7, 2001, the same day the United States began its air campaign against Taliban and al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan.\n\nTwo months later the Taliban was completely routed from Afghanistan and within another couple of weeks those key members of al Qaeda who had survived the intense American airstrikes were fleeing to neighboring Pakistan and Iran.\n\nGambling on weakness\n\nBin Laden disastrously misjudged the likely American response to the 9/11 attacks because he labored under the delusion that the United States was weak. In his first television interview on CNN in 1997, bin Laden claimed the United States was a paper tiger, pointing to the American withdrawals from Vietnam in the early 1970s, Lebanon in the early 1980s and from Somalia in 1993 as evidence of the United States' waning power. Bin Laden told CNN, \"The US still thinks and brags that it has this kind of power even after all these successive defeats in Vietnam, Beirut ... and Somalia.\"\n\nBizarrely, bin Laden believed that al Qaeda's attacks on New York and Washington would result in an American withdrawal from the Middle East. Instead, the United States quickly toppled the Taliban and al Qaeda -- \"the base\" in Arabic -- lost the best base it had ever had in Afghanistan.\n\nJUST WATCHED How Special Ops forces trained for the bin Laden raid Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How Special Ops forces trained for the bin Laden raid 03:57\n\nIn the years after the 9/11 attacks the United States not only did not reduce its influence in the Middle East, but it also established or added to massive bases in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. And, of course, it also occupied both Afghanistan and Iraq. Bin Laden's tactical victory on 9/11 turned out to be a spectacular strategic flop.\n\nSince 9/11 the CIA has eliminated many dozens of al Qaeda's leaders in drone strikes. The CIA also provided the leads that eventually led to the death of bin Laden, when US Navy SEALs raided his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.\n\nMeanwhile, al Qaeda has not been able to strike the United States again after 9/11.\n\nA letter written by an al Qaeda member nine months after 9/11 that was addressed to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the operational commander of the September 11 attacks, gives a sense of how much the attacks had backfired : \"Consider all the fatal and successive disasters that have afflicted us during a period of no more than six months. ... Today we are experiencing one setback after another and have gone from misfortune to disaster.\"\n\nStrategic disaster\n\nIn 2004 Abu Musab al Suri, a Syrian jihadist who had known bin Laden since the late 1980s, released on the Internet a history of the jihadist movement in which he described the strategic disaster that had engulfed the Taliban and al Qaeda after 9/11: \"America destroyed the Islamic Emirate [of the Taliban] in Afghanistan, which had become the refuge for the mujahideen. ...The jihad movement rose to glory in the 1960s, and continued through the '70s and '80s, and resulted in the rise of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, but it was destroyed after 9/11.\"\n\nDespite the fact that after 9/11 it was obvious to al Qaeda insiders that their organization had taken a terrible beating, Saif al-Adel, one of the group's military commanders, explained in a 2005 interview that the strikes on New York and Washington were, in fact, a devilishly clever scheme to provoke the United States into making mistakes: \"Such strikes will force the person to carry out random acts and provoke him to make serious and sometimes fatal mistakes. ...The first reaction was the invasion of Afghanistan.\"\n\nPhotos: Osama bin Laden's Afghan hideout Photos: Osama bin Laden's Afghan hideout Osama bin Laden holds a Kalashnikov rifle in Tora Bora, a mountainous area of Afghanistan, in November 1996.

They prepared instead only for possible US cruise missile attacks by evacuating their training camps.\n\nOf course, making spectacular errors during a war is a prerogative that all sides enjoy. George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in early 2003 will surely rank as one of the greatest foreign policy failures in American history and it's hard to imagine that this misadventure could ever have been undertaken at any time other than in the aftermath of 9/11, when the American public was amenable to what the Bush administration was selling as a quick land war in the Middle East that would help curtail terrorism.\n\nThe rationales for the Iraq War that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was allied in some manner with al Qaeda were, of course total nonsense.\n\nRise of ISIS\n\nWorse, the invasion itself led to the creation of al Qaeda in Iraq in 2004, which is the parent organization of what is now ISIS.\n\nWhen ISIS first gained significant ground in Iraq and Syria in 2014, it focused almost entirely on its actions there and encouraged its overseas followers to join the jihad in the Middle East.\n\nIn 2015, ISIS shifted its strategy, attacking on a large scale outside Iraq and Syria. The group claimed responsibility for the downing of the Russian Metrojet carrying 224 passengers and crew on October 31 in the Sinai in Egypt. Two weeks after the Metrojet bombing, a team of ISIS militants attacked multiple locations in Paris.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThis marked a pronounced shift by ISIS to directing or inciting operations against the West, but it also underlined ISIS' incoherent strategy.\n\nISIS' main goal is to present itself as the Islamic State that it has named itself, the guardian of an expansive caliphate that is both a theological and a geographic entity. But by attacking Western targets ISIS has united a global coalition against it, which is in the process of thoroughly dismantling the ISIS caliphate.\n\nAfter ISIS attacked France in November 2015, the French immediately increased their airstrikes on ISIS targets.\n\nFollowing ISIS' attacks at Istanbul airport in June 2016, the Turkish army attacked ISIS targets inside Syria, quickly taking the city of Jarablus.\n\nISIS' attacks inside Turkey also resulted in a Turkish clampdown on the flow of many thousands of ISIS \"foreign fighters,\" almost all of whom transited Turkey on the way to join the group in Syria.\n\nISIS should have understood that provocative attacks against Western targets would only amplify the war against it. As early as summer 2014, following the murder by ISIS of the American journalist James Foley, the United States substantially increased the number of airstrikes against the group and mobilized a coalition of like-minded nations to join the anti-ISIS coalition.\n\nAccording to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), nations that have conducted strikes against ISIS -- in addition to the United States -- are: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nISIS' terrorist attacks in the West are undermining its overall strategy, which is reminiscent of the mistake al Qaeda made on 9/11, which was to confuse tactical success with strategic victory.\n\nIndeed, according to both Gen. David Petraeus, former US commanding general in Iraq, and Gen Joseph Votel, the commander of CENTCOM, it's quite possible that Mosul, which is the key city that ISIS holds in Iraq, may fall to Iraqi forces by the end of President Barack Obama's term in January 2017.\n\nFrom a purely American perspective, by the time Obama was nearing the end of his second term, the threat from al Qaeda, ISIS and similar groups had receded significantly from its high point on 9/11.\n\nIn the past decade and a half since 9/11, 94 Americans have been killed in the United States by jihadist terrorists. Shocking and tragic as these attacks have been, they still pale in comparison to al Qaeda's murder of almost 3,000 people on the morning of 9/11.",

She has been the creative director of Beijing Design Week since 2013. She is leaving her position after 2016's edition but will remain involved as director of its overseas program and international communication. You can read more about her work at www.baoatelier.com.\n\nBeijing, China (CNN) Over the past decade, the development of Chinese design has been fast-paced, industrious and government-approved. Arguably the output has been of varying quality, given the huge quantity of practices the discipline subsumes.\n\nBut with the growing demand for higher living and environmental standards at home, in the workplace and public spaces, the need for design to play a critical role in China's urban economy is greater than ever.\n\nGenerational and social transformations are also motivating the emergence of different value systems, habits and modes of everyday living.\n\nIn this complex and fragmented context, a notable trait among many young design professionals is a deepening interest in helping to define what design in China means, and what it can do for the China of today and tomorrow. The practical and intellectual ramifications of their designs will be essential to reviving a spirit of cooperation and a social alliance that is vital for the nation today.\n\nRead More",

That includes its broader context, at a time when institutional racism remains very much part of the national conversation; questions of diversity dogging the movie industry; and the personal baggage related to its star.\n\nEverything about this tale of Nat Turner's 1831 slave rebellion has been freighted with significance. For Hollywood, writer-director-producer-star Nate Parker's wrenching look at slavery initially looked like the answer to a prayer -- a sobering work by an African-American filmmaker with major awards potential, amid the absence of minority actors that unleashed the #OscarsSoWhite campaign.\n\nThat gave way to revelations about the rape charge against Parker in college, which, despite his acquittal, has left some of those inclined to root for the film feeling conflicted at best, and repulsed at worst.\n\nAt this point, it's all but impossible to completely separate the film from award politics or Parker's history.

In particular, the [British] Government failed to identify that the threat to civilians was overstated and that the rebels included a significant Islamist element.

That policy was not underpinned by a strategy to support and shape post-(Gadhafi) Libya.

    "text": "Marc J. Randazza is a Las Vegas-based First Amendment attorney and managing partner of the Randazza Legal Group. Follow him on Twitter: @marcorandazza. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Donald Trump has said a lot of strange things -- some funny, some creepy, but none scarier than what he said on Friday : that if he is elected president, he will \"open up our libel laws\" to make it easier to sue the media and \"win lots of money.\" No matter what you may think about his other policy ideas, if he keeps this promise, we won't be able to effectively express dissent against anything else he might want to do. We can fight any bad policy if we have a robust First Amendment.\n\nSome say that Trump is just being a blowhard, that he doesn't know what he is talking about, and that for all his bluster, there is nothing he could or would do.\n\nI am not so sure. Trump has a history of filing SLAPP suits. SLAPP stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. This describes a lawsuit filed against someone for exercising his or her First Amendment rights -- filed with little chance of success, but with the knowledge that the lawsuit itself is the punishment. After all, if people have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves because they criticized Donald Trump, they might think better of doing so again in the future.\n\nHowever, some states, like California and Nevada , have strong anti-SLAPP laws, which dispense with such cases early and force the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorneys' fees. (Full disclosure: I was instrumental in urging passage of the Nevada Anti-SLAPP law.)\n\nTrump recently got stung with an anti-SLAPP decision, which he probably had in mind when he spoke about \"opening up\" our libel laws. In fact, he isn't the first big shot to try to make it easier to sue for defamation after having a SLAPP suit blow up in his face.\n\nTherefore, Trump is clearly frustrated with anti-SLAPP laws (which shows that they work) and the landmark defamation case, New York Times v. Sullivan.\n\nWhen people say that Trump can't do anything about defamation law at the federal level, I think they miss the point that there is a lot of support for a federal anti-SLAPP law. I think we need one, and in fact, HR 2304 was one such proposal this last session. If it passes, we could expect President Trump to veto it.\n\nBeyond new federal legislation, defamation law is a matter of state law, leaving little for a president to do about it. To win a defamation case, the plaintiff must show publication of a false statement of fact that damages the plaintiff's reputation. This standard can vary a bit from state to state, but it generally fits that general set of requirements.\n\nTherefore, what could Trump do to \"open up\" the libel laws? He personally? Nothing legally, but if elected, he could pick Supreme Court justices willing to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan, which is in my view the most important case protecting our First Amendment rights. It is the greatest protection we have from government officials or powerful businesses choking the life out of public debate and a free press. Overturning it would change everything we know about freedom of the press.\n\nIn a defamation case involving an ordinary citizen suing for defamation, the citizen only needs to show that the defendant knew the statement was false, or failed to exercise \"reasonable care\" before publishing it. So let's say that a blogger writes an article about a private citizen accusing that person of a crime, based on a false statement by a witness, without following up. That might be a failure to exercise reasonable care, and the blogger might lose the case.\n\nBut if the same blogger wrote one about a public figure, like Trump, then Trump has to prove that the blogger did so with \"actual malice.\"\n\nEven some judges and lawyers get this wrong, so don't feel bad if you didn't know what \"actual malice\" means. It has nothing to do with \"malice\" at all. It means that the defendant published the statement knowing it was false or with a reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nSo if we return to my example, let's say someone wrote a blog post about Donald Trump, accusing him of a crime, but based it just on an anonymous email, without following up -- that might be considered to be \"reckless disregard.\"\n\nWhy the different standard depending on the plaintiff?\n\nFrom New York Times v. Sullivan: \"(W)e consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\"\n\nDebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open... Justice William Brennan\n\nHow beautiful that language is. It encapsulates what America is all about, the way only Justice William Brennan could.\n\nThe court recognized that public figures have access to the media to defend themselves, and it went on to reject any notion that the speaker must prove truth; instead the plaintiff must prove falsity. This is all because the First Amendment needs \"breathing space\" in order for free speech to survive. And if we impose liability for merely erroneous reports on political conduct, it would reflect the \"obsolete doctrine that the governed must not criticize their governors.\"\n\nSo what if Trump appoints one or two Supreme Court judges who are willing to overturn Sullivan? Justice Elena Kagan has already voiced skepticism about the extension of Sullivan too far into other kinds of libel cases. The only member of the court I think we could count on to be strongly opposed to overturning it is Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nNo matter how flawed it is, our democracy depends upon robust free speech and free press rights. New York Times v. Sullivan matters more than anything else. If we lose the right to criticize the government in wide-open and robust debate, we lose an important part of what it means to be free.",

    "text": "John McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of \"The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Language changes with the times, and when it comes to our conceptions of gender, the times are most certainly changing.\n\nWe are opening up to the idea that binary conceptions of gender are unnecessarily rigid and don't correspond to the self-image of a great many people, and even that people's sense of their gender may not correspond to their biological sex. In this new world, a bland opposition between \"he\" and \"she\" seems increasingly antique, and even insulting, to many.\n\nHowever, doing something about that is going to be a challenge. We are dealing not with merely giving new names to new things or actions, which is easy, but with using new pronouns, which is very hard.\n\nThis is hard because human cognition makes some parts of language more resistant to change than others. Nouns, verbs and adjectives, for example, are like software. It feels natural to add them, subtract them, revise them.\n\nWe expect them to change from era to era -- of course we now have blogs and twerking when we didn't 20 years ago; of course young people now call \"fierce\" what their equivalents long ago called \"keen,\" \"neat,\" \"wicked,\" \"rad,\" and so on. They are what linguists call open class words.\n\nPronouns, however, are closed class words. As shorthand for any thing or concept, pronouns are used so often and so unconsciously that they are more like hardware. A new object or practice is one thing -- but a new \"you\" or a new \"him\" or \"her\"?\n\nIt's harder to wrap our minds around changing something so cognitively fundamental, just as one does not pop up with new prepositions: You might wish there were a little word to indicate \"on as in upside down on a ceiling, rather than on a wall or floor.\" But if you made one up it wouldn't catch on -- nouns and verbs are lightbulbs; prepositions are the wiring inside the walls.\n\nJUST WATCHED Getting real: Explicit language on TV in the seventies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Getting real: Explicit language on TV in the seventies 02:51\n\nSix-thousand years ago, in the ancestor of most of today's European languages on the Ukranian steppes, while most of the language would have seemed like Hittite to us (because it sort of was!), its speakers were using pronouns that sounded roughly like \"me,\" \"you,\" and \"we\" (not to mention the \"tu\" familiar from French and Spanish). That's how hardy pronouns are.\n\nThis is why previous attempts to fashion gender-neutral pronouns haven't caught on (believe it or not, there were once calls for the blend hesh!), and why as clever as today's \"ze\" is, its evolution from in-house tradition to society-wide acceptance will be slow at least, and possibly ill-fated. Bias alone will play its part, surely, but even without it, new pronouns require a mental effort analogous to conceiving dimensions beyond the third.\n\nIf anglophones are to accept new pronouns for new times, two things will be necessary. For example, the truth is that one thing that helps people change their pronoun usage is shame. For example, of all the \"blackboard grammar\" rules that English speakers are schooled in, such as that two negatives mean a positive or that one must say fewer books rather than less books, only one has truly caught on to the extent that it is part of the grammar actual people use comfortably. It is the rule stipulating that one must say \"Billy and I went to the store\" rather than \"Billy and me,\" because me is \"wrong\" as a subject.\n\nThis is a rule no one imposed on English until a couple hundred years ago, and is unheard of in many other languages like French and Swedish. However, for better or for worse, it has been so successfully drilled into our heads as a mark of basic intelligence and propriety.\n\nNow, I would hope that pronouns like \"ze\" would not be imposed with the knuckle-rapping and contemptuous indignation with which the Billy and I rule has been promulgated. However, there is room for presenting \"ze\" as a matter not of fashion, but of basic civility -- people must think of new pronouns as the proper thing to do, not as a stunt.\n\nTo the extent that societies change their pronoun usage, it tends to involve recasting old pronouns, or even expressions, into new functions. European languages like French, for example, use the plural \"vous\" to address a single person with respect. Spanish's respectful \"usted\" began as \"your mercy,\" \"vuestra merced,\" not as a brand new little word imposed by fiat. In this light, our own \"they\" could be handy as a new way to address people gender-neutrally. Many have called for exactly this.\n\nAnd not just recently -- English speakers have been using \"they\" in the singular for eons. In starchy old \"Vanity Fair,\" William Thackeray writes \"A person can't help their birth.\" Today, we spontaneously use sentences such as \"Tell each student they should hand in the paper on Tuesday.\" However, this is another of those things that we are told is a mark of ignorance because \"they is plural.\" However, our new times may require that we get past that notion, which shouldn't be a problem because it has always been absurd.\n\nAfter all, in French, vous \"is plural,\" yet no one seems to mind. Once upon a time, you \"was plural\" while thou was used in the singular. Today, you \"is\" singular as well and no one bats an eye. In the same way, in our \"hardware,\" \"they\" is both singular and plural. Our new conceptions of gender are a good time to get past the conservatism about singular \"they.\"\n\nThe naysayers complain about the prospect of sentences like \"They is upstairs,\" but this is a distraction: gender-neutral they should be used, as it has been forever, with plural verb forms: \"They are upstairs\" will mean that one person is upstairs as well as two or more. \"But won't that be confusing?\" one may ask -- upon which the answer is another question: When have you been confused as to whether \"You are my favorite\" referred to yourself or yourself and some other people? Context pulls a great deal of weight in how we communicate.\n\nAssessing the prospects of new pronouns like ze and recast pronouns like they, my bet would be on they, in terms of the chances that, in 50 years, everybody is on board and on to the next controversy. What we do know, however, is that we are at a point where anglophones will need to accept some kind of change in how we use the language. Call it a teaching moment --language not only never stops changing, but could not.",

This is powerful.\n\nJUST WATCHED Simone Biles wins all-around gymnastics gold in Rio Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Simone Biles wins all-around gymnastics gold in Rio 00:41\n\nLast Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered. Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.\n\nLast Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event. And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver. And this week Simone's floor routine won her a fourth gold medal in Rio; Raisman took the silver.\n\nWe are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country. Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team. (They are the \"Final Five\" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.)\n\nBut the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.\n\nJUST WATCHED All eyes on US women's gymnastics team Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH All eyes on US women's gymnastics team 00:54\n\nMost of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business. These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families. Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.\n\nWe must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.\n\nAt my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions. In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.\n\nPhotos: Rio Olympics: Day 6 U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps celebrates his 22nd Olympic gold medal after he won the 200-meter individual medley on Thursday, August 11.

    "text": "(CNN) Threats, bribes and stuffed ballot boxes may sound like a political drama, but these are all real issues that Africans face during national elections, a public opinion study has revealed.\n\nThe results, published by pan-African research institute Afrobarometer paint a dire picture of trust in the democratic process on the continent, where less than half (44%) of people across the 36 countries surveyed say they trust their national electoral commission only somewhat or a lot.\n\nPeople in countries with upcoming elections, or who have had elections recently, expressed some of the lowest levels of trust, says lead author Peter Penar, a researcher and lecturer in political science at Michigan State University.\n\n'Alarming numbers'\n\nTake Gabon for example, which has seen post election protests and unrest this month after opposition leader Jean Ping lost by less than 6,000 votes.\n\nThere, 51% have no trust at all in their election commission, and a mere 25% say they trust them a lot or somewhat.\n\n\"Those are all very alarming numbers and, it shows an extreme lack of confidence,\" Penar says.\n\nThe survey was based on face-to-face interviews with between 1,200 and 2,400 people in each of the 36 countries.\n\nWhile individuals' responses are not published, the researchers have identified a number of key factors contributing to the lack of trust.\n\nA checkered history\n\nA history of vote manipulation entrenched in people's memories, lack of transparency of election monitoring bodies and corruption all influence people's trust in the system and many are afraid when casting their vote, the researchers found.\n\nBut what worries people the most is the counting of votes, Penar says, with 38% of Africans believing votes are only sometimes, or even never counted.\n\nVote counts can be tampered with in many ways, according to Penar.\n\n\"[This happens] at the polling stations. Stuffing ballots, double voting, multiple voting.\"\n\nMethods for swaying voters may also include threats, actual violence and bribery.\n\nHow much for your vote?\n\nBribery is commonplace in some countries, the study showed.\n\nThe practice is illegal, and so rather than asking people whether they have accepted bribes, researchers posed the more indirect question of how often people in the country face bribery around election time.\n\nOn average, 43% of Africans said people are often or always bribed, with nearly 70% saying voters were bribed at least sometimes.\n\nSome countries returned startlingly high numbers. In Mali, 78% of people said voters were often or always bribed, and in Senegal the figure was 68%.\n\nThe bribes may range from giving a little money at the polling stations to being offered seeds or medicines during campaigns, Penar says.\n\nThreats of violence at the polls\n\nVoter intimidation is also key, the researchers found, with 44% of those surveyed saying they are sometimes, often or always threatened with violence when voting.\n\n\"That's incredibly high,\" says Penar.\n\n\"This makes people afraid of going to the polls and expressing an autonomous and personal choice of who they want to win.\"\n\nSurprising findings\n\nAmong the most surprising findings, according to Penar, was the lack of trust in Ghana, which goes to the polls in December this year.\n\n\"We think of Ghana as a country that's really improved in terms of electoral competition and having alternation of power.\"\n\nStill, 37% of Ghanaians say they don't trust the national electoral commission at all.\n\nThe picture looks different across the Atlantic. A 2016 Pew study showed that 78% of US citizens are confident, or very confident, that their vote will be counted fairly in the upcoming election.\n\nIn Africa, the Afrobarometer study showed that an average 54% across the 36 countries believe that, votes are often or always counted fairly in their country.\n\nCan digital save the day?\n\nNew digital tools such as using fingerprints and digital imaging to identify voters is changing the way elections are run in Africa, which may improve the process in the future.\n\nSouth African voters having their ID checked digitally at a polling station\n\nIn Namibia, a new system appears to have boosted voters' trust, Penar says.\n\n\"Namibia has invested in an electronic voting system. Interestingly one of the best countries in terms of trust in their election commission is Namibia, at 74%.\"\n\nBut while new digital tools can make it harder to tamper with votes, they can also create problems as they require electricity and technical know-how at the polling stations, something not to be taken for granted in rural areas, Penar adds.\n\nAnd while election processes could be improved by storing and counting votes digitally, issues with corruption may remain.\n\n\"The servers on which the results data is stored may be owned by a friend of the president or a relative of an election commission. That happens.\"",

    "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) The search for alien life just got bigger. A lot bigger.\n\nThe world's largest telescope will be completed this week in China and it has scientists very, very excited.\n\nWith a whopping 1,640 feet (500 meter) wide dish the size of 30 football fields, the telescope will able to detect radio signals -- and potentially signs of life -- from distant planets.\n\n\"China's latest telescope will be able to look faster and further than past searches for extraterrestrial intelligence,\" says Douglas Vakoch, president of METI International, an organization dedicated to detecting alien intelligence.\n\nCradled in a karst hollow in the mountainous landscape of southwest China, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST , starts operation September 25.\n\nIt's a process known by astronomers as \"first light\" -- when a telescope opens its eyes and takes its first pictures of the universe.\n\nAnd FAST is wide eyed: its field of vision is almost twice as big as the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico that has been the world's biggest single aperture telescope for the past 53 years.\n\nRussia's RATAN-600 telescope is larger than FAST by diameter with panels arranged in a 576 meter wide ring -- but it's not one single dish and its collection area is much smaller than FAST and Arecibo.\n\nDecade to find right location\n\nConstruction of the $185 million mega project began in 2011, with the last of the 4,450 triangular panels that form the dish painstakingly lowered into place in July this year.\n\nWhile the structure itself is too big to move, each of the panels can be adjusted.\n\n\"You can control the surface to point at certain points in the sky. A mesh of steel ropes allows a hydraulic push and pull mechanism,\" says Andreas Wicenec, professor of Data Intensive Research at the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia.\n\nIts remote location in China's Guizhou province was one of 400 places scientists surveyed over 10 years. The egg-cup shaped valley is perfectly sized and the surrounding mountains provide a shield against radio frequency interference.\n\nIt was once home to \"Green Water Village\" a remote settlement of 12 families that had no electricity. The 65 villagers are among 9,110 that authorities uprooted in order to help improve the telescope's listening capabilities.\n\n\"I never thought the first time I would move would be to make way for a telescope,\" former villager Yang Chaolan, 62 told Xinhua, China's official news agency.\n\nHer son plans to open a restaurant in the town they have been relocated to in the hope the feat of engineering will bring tourists to the poor region.\n\nFAST is almost twice as the Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico.\n\nLittle green men?\n\nThe telescope is expected to shed light on the origins of the universe by mapping the distribution of hydrogen, the most abundant element in our galaxy and beyond.\n\n\"Because of FAST's incredible sensitivity, it will be able to chart the hydrogen distribution even in far flung galaxies,\" says Vakoch.\n\nFAST will also enable scientists to detect many more pulsars -- dense, rotating stars that act as cosmic clocks. This could provide scientists with the capability to detect gravitational waves -- ripples in space-time -- that shed light on how galaxies evolved.\n\nAn aerial shot of the telescope under construction.\n\nBut for many people, the most exciting goal is the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\nThe recent discovery of three life-friendly planets outside our solar system has rekindled discussion of whether intelligent life is unique to Earth.\n\nFAST's sensitivity will be capable of detecting exoplanets like these in ways that other telescopes cannot.\n\n\"FAST's potential to discover an alien civilization will be five to 10 (times) that of current equipment, as it can see farther and darker planets,\" Peng Bo, director of the NAO Radio Astronomy Technology Laboratory, told Xinhua.\n\nWorld's largest radio telescope FAST in SW China's #Guizho to operate from Sept. 25 pic.twitter.com/13LV2Froi2 \u2014 People's Daily,China (@PDChina) September 17, 2016\n\nAmbitions space program\n\nFAST also underpins China's bold space program, which is kicking into high gear.\n\nLast week, Beijing launched the Tiangong-2 space lab -- a precursor to a 20 ton space station. It's also set for its longest crewed mission in October aboard the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft.\n\nLonger term goals include putting a man on the moon and sending a robotic probe to Mars.\n\nThe telescope could help track some of these missions, says Wicenec.\n\nHowever, there are limitations on what the telescope can do. It's unable to project the trajectories of comets or asteroids for example.\n\n\"FAST may help explain the origin of the universe and the structure of the cosmos, but it won't provide warning of Earth-bound asteroids that could destroy human civilization,\" says Vakoch.\n\nChina has long been secretive about its military-linked space program, but the scientists CNN spoke to for this piece expected Beijing to be open to international cooperation.\n\nChinese astronomers are expected to receive priority on the telescope for the two to three years and then it will be opened to scientists worldwide.\n\n\"It's a prestige project but astronomy is very international. China is no exception,\" says Wicenec.",

    "text": "CNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the \"2 degrees\" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\n\n(CNN) \"Climate change is the canvas on which the history of the 21st century will be painted.\"\n\nThat's Mark Lynas, writing in \"Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet.\"\n\nIt's a true if disturbing prediction.\n\nBy some accounts, we've already entered the Anthropocene , an epoch defined by human degradation of the natural world. We're causing extinctions, changing the climate. Mother Nature is still powerful, sure. But, as Lynas explains, we humans are so fundamental a force that we are changing the way she works.\n\nI recently asked readers of my \"2 degrees\" newsletter ( sign up here ) to suggest \"must-read\" books on climate change -- and Lynas' important work of nonfiction was among your top recommendations. I've been reading it, and I recently interviewed the author. The book takes a degree-by-degree look at the future of our planet as it continues to warm. Two degrees of warming, which the international community is trying to avoid, and which is the focus of my climate change initiative at CNN, sounds bad. But, as Lynas told me, a world that's 6 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution, which is possible if we keep burning alarming amounts of fossil fuels and chopping down forests, sounds downright hellish.\n\nYou'll find Lynas' \"Six Degrees\" on a list of 12 climate change must-reads below. It includes a Pulitzer Prize winner, Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction,\" as well as an illustrated account of an artist's dive into climate science, titled \"Climate Changed.\"\n\nYou readers suggested all these, and I've included some of your comments about them.\n\nWe'll tackle \"Six Degrees\" first, since it's a great primer. I'll post an interview with Lynas on Thursday, and then we'll read his book together over the course of the month.\n\nHe's graciously agreed to take your questions in a few weeks.\n\nThink we missed something? Feel free to leave suggestions in the comments section below.\n\n1. \"Six Degrees,\" by Mark Lynas\n\nChapter by chapter, Lynas explores what the world would look like if it warms 1 degree, 2 degrees, 3, degrees Celsius, etc. He's great at distilling the science and maintaining a sense of optimism amid some very gloomy predictions about the future. Suggested by Lance Olsen.\n\n2. \"This Changes Everything,\" by Naomi Klein\n\n\"Well researched, compelling arguments, hits home for multiple audiences, and is a realistic call to action.\" -- Laura S. Lynes, from Canmore, Alberta\n\n3. \"The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight,\" by Thom Hartmann\n\n\"It's all-encompassing -- it delves into the various feedback systems in a climate change context, and also the underlying cultural philosophy or stories we tell ourselves that continue to create the situation we're in. Fascinating stuff!\" -- Trevor, from Los Angeles\n\n4. \"The Age of Sustainable Development,\" by Jeffrey D. Sachs\n\n\"Comprehensive and positive summary of the steps required for sustainable development with good overviews of the problems causing climate change.\" -- Dan Fowler, from Austin, Texas\n\n5. \"Comfortably Unaware,\" by Richard A. Oppenlander\n\n\"People don't realize the devastating impact that our food choices have on the planet. This book explains how animal agriculture is the single biggest cause of global warming.\" -- Wendy Horowitz, from New Haven, Connecticut\n\n6. \"The Sixth Extinction,\" by Elizabeth Kolbert\n\n\"An amazingly well written narrative on the effect our species has had on the planet. As our population continues to grow and our demand on our very limited resources escalates, the negative impact we have had and continue to have is well explained.\" -- Sharon Lynch, from Benicia, California\n\n7. \"The End of the Long Summer,\" by Dianne Dumanoski\n\n\"A really thoughtful, wise and balanced appraisal of fact that, going on past changes to the climate, we are likely to reach a sudden tipping point and experience huge climate changes over just a few years, BUT that humans are incredibly resilient and adaptable and rather than go extinct, will likely rise to the challenge.\n\n\"This book gave me hope while presenting the facts.\" -- Persephone Maywald, from Australia\n\n8. \"Climate Wars,\" by Gwynne Dyer\n\n\"Waves of climate refugees. Dozens of failed states. All-out war. From one of the world's great geopolitical analysts comes a terrifying glimpse of the strategic realities of the near future, when climate change drives the world's powers towards the cut-throat politics of survival,\" the publisher's description says.\n\n9. \"Merchants of Doubt,\" by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway\n\nHere's an endorsement from John Horgan, of Scientific American : \"The book, which packages rigorous research in fiery rhetoric, inspired a documentary, 'Merchants of Doubt' ... I highly recommend the book and documentary, which reveal how disturbingly easy it can be for unscrupulous spin-meisters to dupe journalists and the public.\" The book was suggested by Aaron Thierry, a reader from Edinburgh, Scotland\n\n10. \"Don't Even Think About It,\" by George Marshall\n\nA Twitter user -- @timreckmeyer -- suggested this one as part of a discussion on whether we at CNN should be leading climate change stories with images of sad polar bears on ice sheets. (He thinks we shouldn't. You can see from the gallery below that we still are, from time to time.) George Marshall, the book's author, explores how our brains shape (and warp) perceptions about climate change. I'm hoping this book will help me understand how to better explain this subject -- and will settle the polar bear debate.\n\n11. \"Climate Changed,\" by Philippe Squarzoni\n\n\"It's an amazing book. It's an illustrated nonfiction book (graphic novel format) that is built on Squarzoni's interviews with IPCC scientists. The science is well explained, but the power comes from watching Squarzoni absorb the information and struggle to fit it into his life, just like a reader, over the six years it took him to put the book together. So the intangible social aspect of climate, which is probably more important to solutions than climate science itself, is explored with candor.\" -- Richard Reiss, from New York\n\n12. \"The Great Transition,\" by Lester Brown\n\n\"Right away, book club or no, this book must be read: 'The Great Transition,' by Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute,\" a reader, Elizabeth McCommon, wrote in an e-mail. A friend \"put it in my hands this last weekend, saying it would help me regain optimism about the future,\" she said.\n\nSounds like it worked.\n\nEmail questions to: climate [at] cnn.com.\n\nFollow the project on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram",

The resulting list of 100 artists, published in two issues of Rolling Stone in 2004 and 2005, and updated in 2011, is a broad survey of rock history, spanning Sixties heroes (the Beatles) and modern insurgents (Eminem), and touching on early pioneers (Chuck Berry) and the bluesmen who made it all possible (Howlin' Wolf).\n\nThe essays on these top 100 artists are by their peers: singers, producers and musicians. In these fan testimonials, indie rockers pay tribute to world-beating rappers (Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig on Jay-Z), young pop stars honor stylistic godmothers (Britney Spears on Madonna) and Billy Joel admits that Elton John \"kicks my ass on piano.\" Rock & roll is now a music with a rich past. But at its best, it is still the sound of forward motion. As you read this book, remember: This is what we have to live up to.",

    "text": "Today in Southwest Louisiana, 64 children ranging from infants to teens are ready to be adopted. Two of those children are brothers, who we first featured in 2014 in The New Family Tree.\n\n\n\nTen-year-old Leon and nine-year-old Hakeem have watched two of their siblings move into adoptive placements, as they continue to wait in foster care.\n\n\n\nThe brothers have been in state custody for four years now. When we featured them with their brother and sister two years ago, it was a reunion that brought out so many emotions in the children, who had been split into different foster homes.\n\n\"I miss my brother and sister,\" said Hakeem.\n\n\n\nOver the past four years, Leon and Hakeem have stayed together in Mary Williams' home, where she has seen them grow tremendously.\n\n\n\n\"They're very obedient,\" said Williams, \"they have wonderful manners.\"\n\n\n\nWilliams says she is mom and dad at home and the boys long for a forever family with two parents.\n\n\n\n\"Because it could help us,\" said Leon.\n\n\n\nBoth Leon and Hakeem are quiet when you first talk to them, but there is much more to these boys after you scratch the surface.\n\n\n\nThey love sports, good food, and understand what adoption means.\n\n\n\n\"It means that you'll be in your forever home,\" said Hakeem.\n\n\n\nThese brothers hope it is a home that will keep them together, after dealing with the pain of separation from their other siblings.\n\n\n\n\"It is important because I don't want to be apart from him or be by myself,\" said Hakeem.\n\n\n\nThose are fears that are hard to hear expressed from a young child. Still, Hakeem and Leon are opening themselves up once more in the hopes that the outcome this time is their own adoption.\n\n\n\nThese brothers are legally freed for adoption through the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services. Adoptions through foster care typically cost under $500.\n\n\n\nThe first step to take if you are interested in learning more about the foster-to-adopt process is to call the Lake Charles region DCFS office at 337-491-2470 to make an inquiry.\n\n\n\nCheck out The New Family Tree tab on the 7News Mobile App and here for information on the adoption certification process and foster-to-adopt resources in our community.\n\nHere's a look at the orientation schedule for the next month at the Lake Charles region office, 1919 Kirkman Street in Lake Charles:\n\n\n\n*Saturday, October 8 at 10:00 A.M.\n\n*Monday, October 17 at 6:00 P.M.\n\nThe next step after orientation is completion of MAPP classes.\n\n\n\nSaturday classes: October 22, 29, November 5 from 9:00 A.M.-4:30 P.M.\n\n\n\nThursday classes: December 1, 8, January 5, 12, 19, and 26 from 6:00-9:00 P.M.\n\nCopyright KPLC 2016.

    "text": "(CNN) An ambitious update of Michael Crichton's sci-fi thriller, \"Westworld\" finds an intriguing new point of entry into the story -- examining morality in the context of artificial intelligence -- that both provokes thought and blunts the HBO program's dramatic impact.\n\nOn the plus side, for those unenthused about a recent wave of series inspired by movies or old TV shows -- most of which haven't been particularly inventive -- in bringing \"Westworld\" to life, the writers didn't just robotically go through the motions.\n\nCrichton's 1973 film (which spawned a good sequel, \"Futureworld\") was clearly prescient, dealing with an amusement park for adults populated by realistic robots, allowing for hedonistic indulgence. Despite assurances to the contrary, everything went wrong, as the robots went haywire and began killing their human playmates.\n\nAs conceived by writer-director Jonathan Nolan (a veteran of brother Christopher's movies and \"Person of Interest,\" another series with a baked-in warning about technology) and Lisa Joy, \"Westworld\" seems just as timely. After all, part of that early vision has already come to pass, with dramatic breakthroughs in AI, robotics, and immersive entertainment experiences like virtual reality.\n\nThe main twist, beginning with the 75-minute premiere, is that the producers approach the material heavily from the point of view of the \"hosts,\" as they're called, who are experiencing new sensations that come perilously close to the dawning of sentience.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "If it turns out Donald Trump owed nothing in federal income taxes for years thanks to a $916 million business loss he claimed in the mid-1990s, he would join an exclusive club few can even believe exists.\n\nIts members are the highly well off who end up with zero federal income tax liability in a given tax year.\n\nThis year, despite making more than $1 million, roughly 666 households likely won't owe any federal income tax, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center.\n\nAnd another 3,700 or so households making between $500,000 and $1 million also will not have to send a check to Uncle Sam.\n\nGranted, that's barely a sliver of the estimated 77 million tax filers -- or 44% of all households -- who likely will end up owing no federal income taxes. More than three-quarters of them make $40,000 or less.\n\nBut it's always a curiosity how someone living off of seven figures -- including not just their regular income but income from things like government benefits and employer-paid fringe benefits -- doesn't end up with a positive federal income tax liability.\n\nThe tax code, after all, is designed to be progressive. Those who make more typically owe a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those who make less.\n\nRelated: How Trump could lose a billion bucks but still lead a billionaire life\n\nBut the tax code is also chock-full of tax breaks that those with money are more able to use. Those with a great deal of money can afford to invest much of their cash in tax-exempt bonds, for instance.\n\nOr they may make direct investments abroad. If they end up owing tax to a foreign government, they're allowed to take a tax credit for that.\n\nThey also have more money to give to charity, which can yield big deductions.\n\nAnd when they take big bets and lose -- either in their investments or their businesses -- they can take a capital loss or a net operating loss. If the loss is large enough, it can greatly reduce if not eliminate their tax bill altogether in a given year.",

    "text": "But to Japanese architect Yasuhiro Yamashita of Atelier Tekuto, there's nothing more beautiful.\n\nA veteran designer of kyosho jutaku -- or micro homes -- Yamashita has built more than 300 houses, each uniquely shaped and packed full of personality.\n\nAll starkly different, the only thing these homes have in common is their size -- Yamashita's projects start at just 182 square feet.\n\nDemand for small homes in Japan results partly from land scarcity, property prices and taxes, as well as the impending danger posed by the country's regular earthquakes and typhoons.\n\nBut some residents simply prefer a smaller home, seeking a minimalist lifestyle.\n\n\"In Japan, there's a saying ('tatte hanjo nete ichijo') that you don't need more than half a tatami mat to stand and a full mat to sleep,\" says Yamashita. \"The idea comes from Zen -- and a belief that we don't need more than the fundamentals.\"\n\nOf course, the beauty of a well-designed micro home is that it doesn't appear 'fundamental' at all.\n\nBelow, Yamashita divulges 10 strategies to make petite properties feel more spacious.\n\nEmbrace the awkward\n\n\"Asymmetrical pieces of land can often be obtained cheaper than others. And it is an architect's job to work with the land and fulfill the client's request,\" says Yamashita.\n\n\"'Lucky Drops' -- a house in downtown Tokyo -- is a good example. It was a leftover scrap of land that was less expensive because of its irregular trapezoid shape. We had to be creative, but the result is beautiful. There's a saying in Japanese, that the last drop of wine is considered to be lucky. That's the inspiration.\"\n\nPurchased by a couple on a limited budget, Lucky Drops sits on an irregular piece of land. The long, thin site is just 2.5 feet wide as its narrowest, making it a challenging project for Atelier Tekuto.\n\nThis triangular plot of land sat at the intersection of two streets. Atelier Tekuto turned it into a spacious workshop and private home, with strategically placed windows to balance privacy and natural light.\n\nBuild towards the sky\n\n\"When you look at an area in 2D, it might seem very small -- perhaps the plot is just a few meters wide. But thinking in terms of volume, you can build the home higher and create more space. I try to make the house feel like it's extending upwards into the sky, so it's almost like the sky is part of the house. I also build high ceilings, so you don't feel cramped.\"\n\nThis Tokyo home, designed by Atelier Tekuto, takes the shape of a polyhedron in order to provide an enormous skylight above the living room.\n\nAptly named \"Framing the Sky,\" this Atelier Tekuto home was built on a polygon-shaped site. The architects focused on the relationship between nature and people, by incorporating a large skylight to make the home feel like it was extending upwards into the sky.\n\nIncorporate nature\n\n\"In Japan, about 70% is mountains and forest and 30% of the land is rather flat, making it more suitable for residences and rice farms. Even so, we are not trying to fight against nature -- we're trying to live along with it. You can see this in the homes we design. Most of our homes incorporate natural materials and large windows to let in lots of natural light.\"\n\nHome to 16 skylights, Boundary House directly connects its owners with nature. Inside, Atelier Tekuto used cedar wood and natural stone, as well as a few surprising alfresco spaces.\n\nA combination of a shop and private home, Wakka incorporates lots of natural touches, such as a small stone garden and a series of sliding doors that offer more alfresco space.\n\nThink outside the box\n\n\"Instead of traditional square corners, I often cut the edges of the house into triangular shapes. This creates more surface area and more room for windows. There's always a corner open to the sky. That way, as the sun moves, the home is always filled with natural light.\"\n\nDesigned by Atelier Tekuto for a family of five, Iron Mask is steel-based house with a unique curving facade that made the most of the site's shape.\n\nGo monochrome\n\n\"What you see informs 60% of your perception of a space. Imagine that you're inside an eggshell, with the same color and texture all over. There's no real start or finish, no real corners.\n\nIt is a visual effect that will make the space expand. I think that the color white makes spaces look larger, but I prefer to use the natural colors of materials rather than painting.\"\n\nDesigned by Atelier Tekuto for a family of five, Iron Mask is steel-based house with a unique curving facade that made the most of the site's shape.\n\nThe color white can make spaces look larger, but any consistent palette can create a similar effect. Atelier Tekuto often incorporates natural materials and textures rather than painting.\n\nUse reflective materials\n\n\"To trick the eye, I use polished stainless steel features. They reflect light and make an area seem larger. In 'Reflection of Mineral,' for example, I used stainless steel in the kitchen and in the bathroom to make the space feel more expansive.\"\n\nAn industrial-style home designed by Atelier Tekuto, Wafers makes use of reinforced concrete, steel and highly reflective windows.\n\nHide Storage\n\n\"People tend to accumulate a lot of things over time. I want it all to be hidden away, out of sight, so I build a lot of invisible storage inside the house. If you keep the area wide open and uncluttered, then it's hard for people to really comprehend the size of the space.\"\n\nide Atelier Tekuto's M House, everything has its place. The uncluttered space feels spacious and large, an effect that's accentuated by floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nThe owner of Cell Bricks, also a designer, requested an \"out of the norm\" home and Atelier Tekuto delivered. The house has lots of natural storage thanks to the stacked steel-box design, making it functional as well as visually engaging.\n\nStay close to home\n\n\"In the 20th century, architecture was meant for the masses, for the general public. Designs and buildings were constructed quickly and economically -- all with the same materials and same appearance. We were in an era of globalization and everyone wanted the same thing.\n\nBut now, people are looking to their own regions, their own local traditions for inspiration. That's where design is moving -- closer to home.\"\n\nUsing natural materials such as cedar wood and terrazzo floors, Atelier Tekuto created a nature-inspired abode for a Japanese family.\n\nInvent new solutions\n\n\"I spend a lot of time developing new materials from what other people consider to be 'waste.' I'm like a garbage man. If I find materials that are not commonly used or have been discarded, then I get really excited.\n\nIf I can't find the materials that go along with the structure, then I invent a new one. For example, I was unhappy with the cement used for homes in Japan, so I worked with Tokyo University to develop a new type. Our recyclable Shirasu Cement is made from volcanic ash deposits.\"\n\nTwo chemists own R Torso C and they specifically requested a concrete design with an eco-friendly approach. Atelier Tekuto set out out to develop a new type of environmentally friendly cement, called Shirashu.\n\nPersonalize your home\n\n\"A few factors affect my designs -- the specificities of the land, the way the light hits the property, the neighborhood, and the client's personal requests. A home is very personal. In 'Reflection of Mineral,' the clients wanted a strong, sharp-looking design. From there, I choose materials based on the design, depending on what would be best for the space.\"\n\nAtelier Tekuto approached Reflection of Mineral with an open mind. The clients requested a strong design that would be a memorable piece of architecture while providing the maximum amount of livable space.",

The battle was won through mass vaccination to prevent the viral disease, which can cause severe health problems including pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and even death.\n\nMeasles affects primarily children. Symptoms include high fever, generalized rash all over the body, stuffy nose and reddened eyes. Considered one of the most contagious diseases, the measles virus can be transmitted through contact with the secretions or breathing airborne droplets from an infected person.\n\nChildren who are malnourished and people with weakened immune systems are more like to experience serious complications including encephalitis, severe diarrhea and ear infections.\n\nA disease is declared eliminated when there has been no transmission is a specific geographic region for a year or more, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Once elimination is achieved in every region of the world, eradication is declared.\n\nBefore the start of a vaccination campaign in 1980, measles caused 101,800 deaths in the Americas for the years 1971 through 1979. Worldwide, measles resulted in nearly 2.6 million deaths annually prior to 1980. As a result of global efforts, only 244,704 measles cases were reported worldwide in 2015, more than half of them in Africa and Asia.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) Lamps and armchairs made of mushroom roots and garbage may sound futuristic, but they're already in the hands of interior designers.\n\nVarious types of packaging, wood panels and insulation can also be made from the stuff, which is grown by New York-based biomaterials company Ecovative\n\nThe ingredients are agricultural byproducts such as soy and corn husks, mixed with mycelium -- the tubular filaments of fungi, which often serve as underground root networks -- that acts like glue.\n\n\"The best technology in the world is natural technology,\" says Ecovative's CEO Eben Bayer.\n\n\"Mycelium is nature's glue. It's what holds the forest floor together.\"\n\nThe new plastic?\n\nThe process is called \"biofabrication,\" and it was devised as an alternative to plastic production.\n\nThe waste comes from nearby farms, and the finished products are even compostable. The aim is to divert waste from landfills and oceans\n\nUse of plastics around the world is increasing and expected to double in the next 20 years. Much of it ends up in the oceans, which will contain more plastic than fish by 2050, according to a report by the World Economic Forum\n\nA compostable alternative to plastic packaging\n\nWhile you can't make plastic bags from mushrooms, the material can replace some packaging and offers an alternative to styrofoam. Dell, for example, use Ecovative's compostable packaging, which breaks down within 30 days once discarded.\n\nLike baking bread\n\nMaking this seemingly magic mushroom material is simpler than it sounds, says Bayer: \"I like to call it low-tech biotech. It's almost like making bread.\"\n\nWater is added to the agricultural waste. Then a drop of the mycelium cells, which begin to grow, feeding on the waste.\n\n\"They grow like little hairs. Each mycelial cell is like a fraction of the width of one of your hairs,\" he explains. \"And they grow through and around the particles.\"\n\nAfter an initial growth period it is mixed again and put into moulds or plastic bags, where it hardens and grows into shape.\n\nThe form and type of mould depends on the product. Harder materials are pressed into shape and then baked in the oven to kill off the fungi. This gives it a shelf life similar to that of wood.\n\nMake your own mushroom interiors\n\nEcovative sells a DIY kit to designers who grow the material in their studios.\n\n\"We make our raw materials available in a living form. It's dehydrated, like a sea monkey.\"\n\nNew York based studio Danielle Trofe Design has just grown 50 lampshades for a new hotel in Brooklyn, Bayer says.\n\n\"And that's what we want -- to see more people using mycelium and other grown materials to make products.\"\n\nA lampshade grown using the material\n\nThere are already other companies out there using similar techniques. San Francisco company MycoWorks , for example, make a leather substitute using mycelium.\n\nNext month, Ecovative will launch a range of furniture, starting with office chairs and desks.\n\n\"I believe it's the world's first fully grown line of furniture,\" says Bayer.\n\nCan it compete with furniture giants?\n\nEverything from the seat cushioning to the table tops is grown. The sturdier parts are made from an alternative to engineered wood, and the materials are free from harmful chemicals like formaldehyde, which has been classified as a carcinogen\n\nThe company received a Cradle to Cradle gold certification, a type of sustainability stamp of approval. This is hard to achieve, according to Jayson Jay, Director of the Sustainability Initiative at MIT Sloan.\n\n\"It means that they have both been able to eliminate formaldehyde, and not replaced it with anything else toxic, so that's really good.\"\n\nBut to be competitive, Ecovative need to appeal to consumers both in terms of price and product range, Jay says, which usually doesn't happen until a company reaches large-scale production levels.\n\n\"You can have all the green eco-cred in the world, but you are not going to have any impact if people don't buy your product.\"\n\nA whole new material?\n\nEcovative's alternative to engineered wood will be priced at the higher end of the price bracket, alongside higher quality boards.\n\nBayer is positive the market will open up, as people are becoming more aware of indoor pollution caused by formaldehyde-based resins.\n\nHe envisions a future where entire homes are grown out of natural, compostable materials.\n\n\"This type of innovation is needed across industries and sectors. It's starting to happen already, and I hope to see that accelerating.\"",

Her website is www.katemaltby.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) It was all in the curtain call. Like an actor at the close of a successful show, Hillary Clinton surged forward into her audience, shaking hands with well-wishers. By contrast, Donald Trump hung back on the stage, his family forming a praetorian guard around him. This was a man who had ended his performance twice as distant from his viewers than when he had confidently begun.\n\nKate Maltby\n\nEven when he strode into the media spin room -- an act unprecedented for a general election candidate in the era of TV politics -- Trump walked the gamut of cameras like a reluctant British royal on an official walkabout, uncharacteristically incapable of projecting his persona into the scrum.\n\nSo low was his voice that foreign camera crews gave up the effort to capture sound, leaving their viewers a stream of silent images of a talking head in a distant crowd. It was all a bit desperate. Unlike Clinton, he had forgotten one of the golden rules of theater. When the show is over, leave the stage. And never, ever, try to write your own review.\n\nAs a theater critic, I'm used to big performances. What can be harder to find is the subtle supporting act, the discreet player who can quietly convince while letting a co-star dominate the stage. Ahead of Monday night's debate, both participants were under pressure to tone down the matinee idol pretensions and blend into the background.\n\nTrump needed to lose the histrionics, prove himself an adult participant in policy debate and keep the spotlight on Clinton and those awkward questions about emails. Clinton, by contrast, needed to sidestep the drama while provoking Trump into the kind of front stage meltdown that might prove his unfitness as commander in chief.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "David A. Love writes for thegrio.com . He is a writer and human rights activist based in Philadelphia. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his.\n\n(CNN) In light of the current unrest in Baltimore, riot shaming seems to be the new fad.\n\nEverybody's doing it, and while it is easy, it helps us change the subject and ignore the harder issues facing African-Americans.\n\nWhat is unfolding in that city, of course, and is receiving national attention, is the aftermath of the death of Freddie Gray , 25, who died of a \"very tragic injury to his spinal cord,\" according to Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez. The exact cause of those injuries remain under investigation. Gray family lawyer said the 25-year-old's \"spine was 80% severed\" while in police custody.\n\nThe circumstances around the man's killing and public outrage in the black community have led to peaceful protests.\n\nAnd unfortunately, though understandably, things have boiled over, with riots and looting by some. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard, and Baltimore schools were closed.\n\nAnd people have lined up to condemn the riots, the looting, and the violence. For example, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was in front of the cameras Monday night referring to the rioters as \"thugs.\"\n\n\"What we see tonight that is going on in our city is very disturbing,\" the mayor said. \"It is very clear there is a difference between what we saw over the past week with the peaceful protests, those who wish to seek justice, those who wish to be heard and want answers, and the difference between those protests and the thugs who only want to incite violence and destroy our city.\"\n\nPresident Obama also referred to the riot participants as \"thugs.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Don Lemon, Gov. Hogan seemed to channel his inner 1950s Southern governor. \"What we've now seen is outside agitators, gangs and just really thugs as the mayor called them, that are out there threatening people, injuring people and destroying property, and we're not going to put up with it,\" Hogan said before he and Mayor Rawlings-Blake walked away from the interview when Lemon's questioning apparently became a little too difficult for them.\n\nAnd Sen. Rand Paul , R-Kentucky, blamed the violence on \"breakdown in the family structure, the lack of fathers and the lack of moral code in our society.\" He added: \"The mayor obviously could have been stronger with saying: 'We are going to secure the city. We are not going to have thievery. We are not going to have thuggery.' \" He then added, \"None of this excuses thuggery and thievery.\"\n\nWhenever there is a killing of an unarmed black person by police, typically, the victim is demonized as a thug, as are the protesters and rioters who react to the killing.\n\nThis is because black people are viewed in their entirety as criminals. Whites who protest or riot are not called thugs, because the word thug serves as a proxy for the N-word, whether it's black or white people using the descriptors.\n\n\"No, it's not the right word to call our children thugs,\" Baltimore City Council member Carl Stokes told CNN's Erin Burnett. \"These are children who have been set aside, marginalized, who have not been engaged by us.\"\n\n\"But how does that justify what they did?\" Burnett asked Stokes. \"That's a sense of right and wrong. They know it's wrong to steal and burn down a CVS and an old persons' home. I mean, come on.\"\n\n\"Come on? Just call them n****rs. Just call them n****rs,\" Stokes exclaimed in frustration.\n\nBut as people line up to condemn the unrest and lecture so-called thugs on how to behave, few condemn the oppressive conditions, the unjust policies, the structural racism, the police brutality and the poverty that have plagued Baltimore for years. And if the looting of the CVS disturbs you more than the alleged severing of a man's spine, then you have lost your humanity, and your priorities are all wrong.\n\n\"When I go to Baltimore, on the East Coast, I'm dealing with 1950s-level black-and-white racism,\" Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told a White House task force on policing. \"It's taken a step back. Everything's either black or everything's white, and we're dealing with that as a community.\"\n\nMr. Gray's death was the breaking point, but it was a long time coming.\n\nAs the Baltimore Sun reported, the city has paid about $5.7 million since 2011 in over 100 police brutality lawsuits and $5.8 million in legal fees. The police have beaten, maimed and killed their victims, which include children, a pregnant mother, a 65-year-old church deacon and an 87-year-old grandmother -- mostly African-American.\n\nAnd as Bill Quigley wrote in the Huffington Post, the disturbing statistics about daily life in Baltimore are more shocking than recent events.\n\nAgain, the numbers are downright disturbing.\n\nMeanwhile, in the midst of Baltimore urban rebellion, some voices have invoked the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his commitment to a strategy of nonviolence. However, they fail to mention what Dr. King said about riots:\n\n\"It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.\"\n\nJohn Angelos, COO of the Baltimore Orioles, echoed King's words:\n\n\"I agree ... that the principle of peaceful, nonviolent protest and the observance of the rule of law is of utmost importance in any society. MLK, Gandhi, Mandela and all great opposition leaders throughout history have always preached this precept.\"\n\nThat said, my personal concern, outrage and sympathy isn't focused on one night's property damage, but on the past four-decades during which an American political elite has shipped middle class and working class jobs away from Baltimore and American cities to China and other countries, plunged tens of millions of good, hard-working Americans into economic devastation, and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every American's civil rights protections in order to control an unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state.\n\nWe need to keep in mind that people are suffering and dying around the U.S., and while we are thankful no one was injured at Camden Yards, there is a far bigger picture for poor Americans in Baltimore and everywhere who don't have jobs and are losing economic, civil and legal rights, and this makes inconvenience at a ballgame irrelevant.\n\nAs we watch the events unfold in Baltimore, not unlike Ferguson -- and Los Angeles 20 years ago, and cities such as Detroit, Watts and Newark which experienced urban rebellions sparked by acts of police brutality in the 1960s -- shaming the rioters is the easy way out when we refuse to address black suffering.\n\nIt is clear that no expense will be spared in bringing America's military might to bear on the black folks of Baltimore. But where were the resources to eliminate poverty and unemployment and end predatory policing in the black community?\n\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.",

    "text": "The former president on climate change, curiosity, and what it means to be a leader\n\nThe office where I met Clinton high in the UN headquarters building belongs to another era. It is an institution built for a world of the past -- one based on Cold War rivalries and the last century's balance of power. It was Clinton's first day in the cramped space, and his entourage of bodyguards and assistants were stumbling over one another in the confines. The Secret Service men dispatched a young press aide to inquire why so many UN staffers were loitering near the elevators, though it was clear that they were simply trying to catch a glimpse of the ex-president.\n\n\"Is this the office?\" an exhausted Clinton asked after shaking my hand. I nodded, as did most of the swarm that followed him. The entire place felt as if it hadn't been touched since the early fifties when the building was raised, a lone skyscraper above an otherwise flat block on the East Side of Manhattan. I heard him chuckle to a staffer as he stepped inside, \"You know what,\" -- 'wahut,' the final word came out -- \"It kinda reminds me of Mad Men. Have you seen that show yet?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Jefferson Blythe III never met his father, a traveling salesman who died in a car accident three months before Bill was born. He took the name Clinton from his hard-drinking and abusive stepfather, Roger, who Bill, at fourteen, demanded never hit his mother again. He hid the abuse from most people in his life. As a junior at Georgetown University, though, he shuttled back and forth to Durham, North Carolina on weekends to make peace with his dying stepfather as he underwent cancer treatments. Clinton almost never drinks; he sleeps little and speaks without reprieve. On the day that we met, the topics of his endless seminar ranged from the evolution of the light bulb to early twentieth-century American film to the beauty of Columbia's Aburr\u00e1 Valley and Medell\u00edn.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most interesting dimension of his character is the pace with which he lives. \"He had said to everybody over and over and over again,\" Chelsea Clinton has said, \"that none of the men in his family live past sixty, or much past.\" As a result, he has always moved at a rather reckless pace, trying to accomplish as much as possible before a short clock -- either real, imagined, or prophetically self-fulfilling -- ticks to a stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs members of my generation look around the world today, we see climate change on the rise and nothing in the way of a successor for the Kyoto Protocol, the proliferation of nuclear weapons still un abated, Millennium Development Goals we're still well short of, a hugely imbalanced global economy that will continue to undermine itself, and I wonder if you worry that you and this post-Cold War generation of leaders will be judged harshly by history?\n\n\n\nNo. I think that's a cheap trick. I mean, all of this \"the greatest generation is World War II?\" -- it just happens that they're the most horrible parents in human history, right?\n\n\n\nIf all of us baby boomers were so bad, then our parents were terrible; they failed. And if we were so bad, how come our kids are so great? We were hellaciously good parents.\n\n\n\nI think it's phony as a $3 bill. I think they had a chance to win World War II and it was clear. These are much more complex things [now]. We have no idea if the World War II generation would have made the decisions they should make on climate change if they thought doing so would bring an end to their economic prosperity.\n\n\n\nThe real problem in climate change is that we're paying for our past success. The established order has too many self-protecting economic entities, and not enough people who yet understand what it takes to change.\n\n\n\nThe World War II generation was thrown into a war by a madman, Hitler, and an expansionist empire in Japan, and we did what we had to do. Look, I admire the World War II generation; I'm just trying to make a point here. I don't think there are defective generations. There are times and struggles and they present different challenges.\n\n\n\nI believe the United States will pass reasonably good climate change legislation, I believe we will get a successor that will be better than Kyoto, and I think that we're in a race against time and circumstance.\n\n\n\nThis will be calamitous if we don't do something about it, and the population of the earth will drop hugely over the next 1,000 years, maybe over the next 200 years, if we don't do something about it.\n\n\n\nWe're really in a race against time. I think history is a relay race and you just got to keep handing off and making things happen. I'm basically pretty optimistic.\n\n\n\nWhere the intersection of science and politics is on climate change, I'd leave to others. We might lose. Our minds may not be able to expand enough collectively to avert the worst.\n\n\n\nI think most people are more literal and they learn things in a serial fashion. Most people have all they can do to keep body and soul together -- even before this economic collapse -- raise their kids, pay their taxes, worry about how to pay for college, deal with their mother's health, and everything.\n\n\n\nIt just takes time to change the mindset, but we're a much more communitarian country and a much more communitarian world than we were 20 years ago. I basically think you've got to get people's attitudes right, and then they have to have a general analysis that's right, and you have to organize for action. And you just have to stumble in the right direction. I'm pretty upbeat about it.\n\n\n\nWhen you're my age, I hope you're dealing with a different set of problems. There'll always be problems, but that's what I hope will happen\n\n\n\nDavid Leopolus, a childhood friend of yours, used to joke with friends that if they were bored, they could always go and watch you read. Is that insatiable curiosity critical to being a good leader?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think in order to do one or two big things, you have to know many little things. I think it's also important in a complex time with a lot of dynamism to be able to relate to all different kinds of people, because, in the end, most political power depends more on persuasion rather than coercion.\n\n\n\nAnd then I think you have to be able to reconcile the complexities and order them in a pattern. For a lot of people who just follow the evening news or read the morning paper, it's like the political equivalent of chaos theory in physics.\n\n\n\nBut your job, if you're a leader, is to take superficially random events and organize them into patterns that tell you what you should do to maximize an opportunity or head off the problem.\n\n\n\nBeing decisive in the face of complexity and ambiguity is important. Being able to make a call, to decide to act, and then figuring out how to act to support that decision. Yes, be curious; yes, appreciate the complexity and ambiguity; but then organize into patterns and decide what you're going to do and execute. I think that's extremely important.\n\n\n\nYou know, Machiavelli said in the 15th century that change was hard because the people who would benefit from it were uncertain of their gain and the people who would lose were positive of their loss; that's pretty much the way it still is. And if you sign on to be a progressive change agent, you had to have a high threshold for pain and you keep throwing yourself under the bridge, but I believe you can really make a difference if you just make these efforts and get up and work at it every day. I left the White House more optimistic than I entered it, after all I went through, and I would wake up every day believing that you can make good things happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis post was adapted from Brian Till's new book, Conversations with Power: What Great Presidents and Prime Ministers Can Teach Us about Leadership. Well, I think that insatiable curiosity is important in a time dominated by complexity and dynamism, because you have so many things you need to understand. For the last 20 years, insatiable curiosity has been really important.I think in order to do one or two big things, you have to know many little things. I think it's also important in a complex time with a lot of dynamism to be able to relate to all different kinds of people, because, in the end, most political power depends more on persuasion rather than coercion.And then I think you have to be able to reconcile the complexities and order them in a pattern.

Being able to make a call, to decide to act, and then figuring out how to act to support that decision. Yes, be curious; yes, appreciate the complexity and ambiguity; but then organize into patterns and decide what you're going to do and execute. I think that's extremely important.You know, Machiavelli said in the 15th century that change was hard because the people who would benefit from it were uncertain of their gain and the people who would lose were positive of their loss; that's pretty much the way it still is. And if you sign on to be a progressive change agent, you had to have a high threshold for pain and you keep throwing yourself under the bridge, but I believe you can really make a difference if you just make these efforts and get up and work at it every day. I left the White House more optimistic than I entered it, after all I went through, and I would wake up every day believing that you can make good things happen.This post was adapted from Brian Till's new book,\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Clinton was cast as a villain, an overbearing spouse allegedly eliciting racism1 to propel his ambitious wife forward to the presidency and, conceivably, to reclaim a good deal of power himself. The Democratic presidential primary of 2008 muddled the esteem that had ballooned during eight years of gaffes and incompetence by his successor in the Oval Office. During that span, Clinton largely redefined the post- presidential years; he circled the globe as a nimble, intrepid freelancer, leveraging charisma and a seemingly limitless Rolodex for both the broader good and personal gain.\"Clinton is a nonprofit conglomerate,\" says one former advisor and long-time friend. It's not an in- accurate characterization. His work fittingly mirrors the rise of social networking and the Internet, a two-point-zero version of previous post-presidential benevolence.Among his most important accomplishments is his success drastically reducing the cost of life-saving anti-retro viral treatment for AIDS victims around the world. The latest round of deals with pharmaceutical companies -- on the heels of others that have helped two million people access treatment -- drops the cost of second-line regiments, for those whose illnesses have overcome first line drugs, by 60 percent. Commitments to charitable work made each year by individuals and corporations attending the Clinton Global Initiative conference reach into the billions of dollars. He launched a ten-year $100 million campaign against extreme poverty in Rwanda and Malawi and, in 2005, raised over a $120 million following Hurricane Katrina with George H. W. Bush.As president, his achievements were matched by equally notable shortfalls. He presided over a massive expansion of economic growth, generating surpluses of $122 billion and $230 billion during his last two years in office; he waged a successful campaign to stem genocide in Kosovo, and greatly expanded free trade and global commerce. But his failure to intervene in Rwanda, where some 800,000 were massacred, or to move effectively to stop genocide in Bosnia, or to advance middle east peace, marked high-profile failures. Domestically, he was unable to pass comprehensive health care reform and ambitious campaign finance reforms. He signed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, which had raised a wall between the speculative trading and underwriting of investment banks and the more traditional lending of commercial, depository banks. The law had been in place since the 1930s. Its elimination helped inflate the massive bubble that burst in the 2007 financial collapse, and meant commercial institutions, like Bank of America and Citibank, were allowed to assume massive risk in the form of housing market credit derivatives. They, of course, had to be bailed out to protect the broader economy. \"I think they were wrong,\" he told ABC in April 2010, referring to his economics advisors, \"and I think I was wrong to take [their advice].\" The Monica Lewinsky scandal and a myriad of other sex-related allegations forever scarred his legacy and remains the first thought for many when his name is invoked.But for most of those who've had the chance to interact with Clinton, his warmth and intelligence overpower the more lurid details that special prosecutor Ken Starr seared into the American conscience. Clinton is surprisingly tender in person, a gentle handshake matches the soft white hair and the unmistakable bulb nose.He has been called the Michael Jordan of politics, an apt comparison in terms of both talent and intensity. Stan Greenberg, who worked as a consultant for both of Clinton's bids for the White House, recalled Clinton's rage at a Ross Perot attack in the closing days of the 1992 campaign: \"They are attacking my character and we must attack Perot's character.\" He went on, speaking over the phone with aides after a long day of campaigning, \"We need to take a meat axe to his brain, cut his head open.\" He demanded a response that was \"red meat and passion, no more pussy ads.\"",

    "text": "Below is an excerpt from forensic pathologist Dr. Judy Melinek 's 2014 memoir \"Working Stiff,\" co-authored by her husband, writer T.J. Mitchell. \"Working Stiff: Two Years, 267 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner\" is available in bookstores worldwide and online. (The names of victims were changed in the book.)\n\n(CNN) \"Remember: This can only end badly.\" That's what my husband says anytime I start a story. He's right.\n\nSo. This carpenter is sitting on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan with his buddies, half a dozen subcontractors in hard hats sipping their coffees before the morning shift gets started.\n\nThe remains of a hurricane blew over the city the day before, halting construction, but now it's back to business on the office tower they've been building for eight months.\n\nAs the sun comes up and the traffic din grows, a new noise punctures the hum of taxis and buses: a metallic creak, not immediately menacing.\n\nThe creak turns into a groan, and somebody yells.\n\nJudy Melinek\n\nThe workers can't hear too well over the diesel noise and gusting wind, but they can tell the voice is directed at them. The groan sharpens to a screech. The men look up -- then jump to their feet and sprint off, their coffee flying everywhere. The carpenter chooses the wrong direction.\n\nWith an earthshaking crash, the derrick of a 383-foot-tall construction crane slams down on James Friarson's head. I arrived at this gruesome scene two hours later with a team of MLIs, medicolegal investigators from the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner.\n\nThe crane had fallen directly across a busy intersection at rush hour and the police had shut it down, snarling traffic in all directions.\n\nThe MLI driving the morgue van cursed like a sailor as he inched us the last few blocks to the cordon line. Medicolegal investigators are the medical examiner's first responders, going to the site of an untimely death, examining and documenting everything there, and transporting the body back to the city morgue for autopsy.\n\nI was starting a monthlong program designed to introduce young doctors to the world of forensic death investigation and had never worked outside a hospital.\n\nJUST WATCHED He's collected nearly 13,000 bodies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH He's collected nearly 13,000 bodies 01:39\n\n\"Doc,\" the MLI behind the wheel said to me at one hopelessly gridlocked corner, \"I hope you don't turn out to be a black cloud. Yesterday all we had to do was scoop up one little old lady from Beth Israel ER.\" Today, we get this.\"\n\n\"Watch your step,\" a police officer warned when I got out of the van. The steel boom had punched a foot-deep hole in the sidewalk when it came down on Friarson. A hard hat was still there, lying on its side in a pool of blood and brains, coffee and doughnuts.\n\nI had spent the previous four years training as a hospital pathologist in a fluorescent-lit world of sterile labs and blue scrubs. Now I found myself at a windy crime scene in the middle of Manhattan rush hour, gore on the sidewalk, blue lights and yellow tape, in a crowd of gawkers and grim cops.\n\nI was hooked.\n\nI'm not a ghoulish person. I'm a guileless, sunny optimist, in fact. When I first started training in death investigation, my husband, T.J., worried my new job would change the way I looked at the world. He feared that after a few months of hearing about the myriad ways New Yorkers die, the two of us would start looking up nervously for window air conditioners to fall on our heads.\n\nMaybe we'd steer our toddler son's stroller around sidewalk grates instead of rolling over them. We would, he was sure, never again set foot in murderous Central Park. \"You're going to turn me into one of those crazy people who leaves the house wearing a surgical mask and gloves,\" T.J. declared during a West Nile virus scare.\n\nInstead, my experience had the opposite effect\u2014it freed us from our six o'clock news phobias.\n\nOnce I became an eyewitness to death, I found that nearly every unexpected fatality I investigated was either the result of something dangerously mundane, or of something predictably hazardous.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'This is the only thing to show for his life' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'This is the only thing to show for his life' 01:26\n\nSo don't jaywalk. Wear your seat belt when you drive. Better yet, stay out of your car and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you're a smoker, stop right now. If you aren't, don't start.\n\nGuns put holes in people. Drugs are bad. You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Mostly. As I would also learn at the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, undetected anatomical defects do occasionally cause otherwise healthy people to drop dead.\n\nOne-in-a-million fatal diseases crop up, and New York has eight million people. There are open manholes. Stray bullets. There are crane accidents.\n\n\"I don't understand how you can do it,\" friends\u2014even fellow physicians\u2014tell me. But all doctors learn to objectify their patients to a certain extent. You have to suppress your emotional responses or you wouldn't be able to do your job. In some ways it's easier for me, because a dead body really is an object, no longer a person at all. More important, that dead body is not my only patient.\n\nThe survivors are the ones who really matter. I work for them too.\n\nFrom WORKING STIFF by Judy Melinek and T.J. Mitchell. Copyright 2014.

This season, she won the Australian Open (which she celebrated by jumping in Melbourne's Yarra river after a bet) and the US Open, reached the Wimbledon final, clinched the silver medal at the Rio Olympics and knocked 22-time major singles champion Serena Williams off the top spot of women's tennis after 186 weeks.\n\nKerber talks to Beltz at a 2013 tournament in Sydney.\n\n'Good vibe'\n\nKeeping Kerber on her toes with bets and games forms an important part of their player-coach relationship.\n\nJUST WATCHED Angelique Kerber wins US Open Replay More Videos ...

Already now we're thinking about some stuff because she's No. 1, some new stuff we want to do. It's not the end of the road -- we really want to go forward now and take the next step to stay there, to play better tennis.\"\n\nStubborn\n\nAs well as her two grand slam titles, Kerber also reached the 2016 Wimbledon final.\n\nLosing is part and parcel of a tennis player's life, even if you are the No. 1 in the world, and at times Kerber can be \"a little bit stubborn,\" Beltz says.\n\n\"You can see it on TV when she's a little bit frustrated and she's looking at me in some ways. But actually right now everything is positive. She won the US Open, she's very happy, the coach is very happy too, so it's really good now.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Kerber made a winning start to life as world No. 1, beating Kristina Mladenovic 6-7 6-1 6-4 to reach the third round of the Wuhan Open in China.",

    "text": "Story highlights Ted Cruz suspends his presidential campaign after Donald Trump wins in Indiana\n\nDavid Gergen: American voters need to sort out Trump's strengths and weaknesses\n\nDavid Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been a White House adviser to four presidents. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. Follow him on Twitter: @david_gergen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Too often these days, we in the media like to proclaim that an event is \"historic\" when, in truth, it is a mere footnote. But after the Indiana primary, it really is true that historians will long be wondering whatever happened to American politics in the Republican presidential race of 2016.\n\nFor the first time in 75 years, a businessman with no prior political experience has virtually captured the nomination of a major national party . The last time this happened was when Wendell Willkie, head of a utilities holding company, stormed the GOP convention in 1940 , winning on the sixth ballot. Willkie went on to become a popular figure who ran a strong race against Franklin Roosevelt before eventually going down by 10 points.\n\nDavid Gergen\n\nThere is, however, a far greater significance to Trump's rise to power than his business background; he is the most unconventional figure either party has put forward in modern times. And, while he will enter a general election as an underdog, chances are not insignificant that he could actually win the White House, entrusted with the most important and powerful office in a fractured world.\n\nIn the coming months, American voters -- not to mention those of us who toil in the media -- need to do some serious sorting out of both his strengths and his weaknesses. Because the truth is that as much as Trump has dominated the airwaves, we still don't know the man anywhere near as well as we should.\n\nWhat is obvious so far is that millions of voters see in Trump a man of strength who can reverse our national direction -- in effect, a turnaround CEO. Frequently, voters turn to candidates whose strengths compensate for the weaknesses of the sitting president. Thus, we elected Jimmy Carter because he seemed honest, a sharp contrast to the Nixon years. Then we turned to Ronald Reagan because he was an antidote to Carter's vacillation. After eight years of George W Bush's plain talk, voters were inspired by Barack Obama's soaring calls. Now, after the Obama years and a string of broken promises by their own leaders, many Republicans believe Trump gets it and will act decisively to address their frustrations. That he is unconventional and outrageous says to them he is real, not a phony.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "Xinjiang, China (CNN) \"Bosh bosh!\" vendors yell as they yank sheep along by their tails, shoving them from trucks into the pens where they'll be sold to their death.\n\nWe're in the riotous Sunday livestock market on the outskirts of Kashgar, in China's remote northwesternmost Xinjiang province.\n\nYaks, camels and Xinjiang's famously fat-bottomed lambs have all been delivered to the market -- the biggest of its kind in Central Asia -- by bearded men from miles around, to be sold by the day's end.\n\nThe air is thick with cries of \"bosh bosh!\" -- meaning \"coming through,\" in the local Uyghur language.\n\nAt a nearby food shack, we order a couple of samsa -- a crispy, stone oven-baked bread parcel filled with seasoned diced lamb, purchased and slaughtered in halal fashion that morning.\n\nHere, the phrase \"farm to table\" is literal. Blood from the remaining flesh of the animal drips from its bones by the shack's entrance.\n\nXinjiang might be one of China's best-kept secrets.\n\nOnce a vital stretch of the ancient Silk Road network of trade routes, today the province is notorious for violent ethnic tensions between the indigenous Turkic Uyghurs and swelling Han population, which have choked tourism in recent years.\n\nMany of its people's faces bear the hallmark of Central Asia, its food has clear Turkish influences and the landscape is arid, fiery, and punctuated by Islamic, Turkic and Kyrgyz architecture.\n\nKashgar Old Town\n\nAnyone who saw the 2007 film \"The Kite Runner\" might recognize Kashgar's Old Town.\n\nIt doubled onscreen as Kabul, in Afghanistan -- the only time Kashgar has appeared in a Western film.\n\nLaghman noodles - allegedly what Marco Polo found in China and took back to Italy; aka pasta. #Laghmannoodles #chinatravel #turpan #oldsilkroad #uighurfood #marcopolo A photo posted by jenni marsh (@jenn1marsh) on Sep 4, 2016 at 7:07am PDT\n\nPerhaps the last time such a global spotlight fell on the oasis city was when Marco Polo passed through in 1273, and called it \"the largest and most important\" city in Xinjiang, before allegedly taking the local laghman noodles back to Italy, and rebranding them spaghetti.\n\nWe try a plate of these noodles served with cooked tomatoes, onions and shredded beef, and can't deny it's not unlike a certain Italian dish.\n\nThose ancient streets captured on film are today mostly vanished.\n\nThe city's Old Town, deemed unsafe to live in, has been demolished. All that remains is a small neighborhood located a 15-minute walk from the Kashgar Bazaar.\n\nNearby lies the new Old Town: an ambitious re-imagining of its predecessor which recaptures its elegant Islamic architecture but without the disorganized charm.\n\nThe old Silk Road\n\nLeaving Kashgar, we head out further west on a trip along the Karakoram Highway (KKH), the road that connects China with Pakistan via winding mountain passes.\n\nOvernight rain has left the road more treacherous than usual. Rocks have fallen which soldiers have been tasked with clearing.\n\nThe 9,000-mile (14,484 km) highway from Kashgar to Abbottabad, in Pakistan, is currently being resurfaced on both sides of the border by Beijing, in a bid to improve the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\nThe China stretch is mostly finished, but the fresh tarmac needs to set, so we make a bumpy journey on rubble tracks beside the empty, pristine road.\n\nEvery 10 minutes the landscape reinvents itself.\n\nFlaming red mountains are replaced by huge gorges. Ethnic Kyrgyz children living in stone houses with solar panels atop appear on the left, Tajik yurts to the right.\n\nThey're followed by grasslands populated by grazing yak and roaming herds of camels that peer into the car windows.\n\nKarakul Lake is the jewel in this bonanza of Instagram-worthy scenes.\n\nStepping out of the car here, it's hard to breathe.\n\nAt its peak, the KKH is 15,397 feet above sea level, making it the highest paved international highway in the world. My lungs briefly brace at the altitude.\n\nCamels along the Karakoram Highway.\n\nKarakul means \"black lake,\" but the name is misleading. Its waters are a majestic jade green. They're backdropped by eery, soft grey sand dunes.\n\nAs we drive higher, towards the snowcapped Tian Shan mountains, it gets colder.

It's a huge province, bordering eight countries -- Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India -- and is impossible to fully explore in such a short time.\n\nOur next stop, via the provincial capital Urumqi, is Turpan -- one of the world's lowest depressions.\n\nThe fast train from Uruqmi takes 1.5 hours to reach Turpan. It whizzes past vast wind turbine farms in the red desert, but also oil and gas fields, a reminder of why Xinjiang is so vital to China.\n\nIn Turpan, we check into a boutique hotel, The Vines , which is part of a working vineyard.\n\nHere, an amazing karez irrigation system of vertical wells and underground canals has channeled water from the mountains for hundreds of years, keeping this desert oasis almost impossibly fertile.\n\nTourism hasn't exactly caught on yet.\n\nWhen I ask to buy a bottle of the red wine produced here, our host directs us to the local supermarket.\n\nTurpan minaret #turpan #farwestchina #china #oldsilkroad A photo posted by jenni marsh (@jenn1marsh) on Sep 1, 2016 at 12:18am PDT\n\nThe scorching Taklamakan desert outside of Turpan is home to the remains of ancient towns long ago swallowed and preserved by the sand, unearthed in the past century.\n\nAs the temperature climbs to an arid 38 degrees Celsius, we find Tuyoq, one of the few inhabited ancient Uyghur villages, where mud-built homes appear camouflaged against the sandy landscape.\n\nOnly the green dome of the Mazar, an Islamic shrine, stands out.\n\nOutside one of the mud homes stands a sign: \"Former residence of Albert Von Le Coq.\"\n\nBeneath, a scathing description outlines how in the early 20th century the German explorer, along with a band of rival Europeans, raided Taklamakan sites of historical treasures belonging to China, and deposited them to museums in their home nations.\n\nThe Bezeklik caves, from the walls of which Von le Coq ripped scores of ancient paintings after he discovered the site in 1905, lie just outside the village.\n\nJam session\n\nBack in Urumqi, we find a rarity in largely alcohol-free Xinjiang: a strip of bars.\n\nGong Yuan Bei Lu is lined with overpriced cocktail joints and coffee shops serving beer.\n\nIt's a contrast to the rest of the province, where refreshment comes in the form of circular flat breads stamped with swirling patterns, shredded pumpkin and lamb steamed dumplings, salty Uyghur ice cream and lamb kebabs gently spitting on street grills.\n\nAround midnight we roll into Fusion Bar.\n\nStyled like a British pub, albeit one with two Christmas trees and a giant Super Mario model, it presents local jazz and rock acts.\n\nWe're the only Westerners in sight and, as complimentary Jack Daniels keep arriving at our table, we're told the night rounds off with a jam session.\n\nAnd so, our time in Xinjiang is brought to a close with my traveling companion, a part-time musician, joining the electronic jazz band on stage to sing \"Autumn Leaves.\"\n\nXinjiang knows how to make an impression.",

Americans, as we have discovered, are angry, frustrated, disillusioned -- and yearning for a savior.\n\nThis happened before, almost a century ago in Europe. It was a time of despair; a time when the old models didn't seem to be working, when the world was changing in confusing ways, and hyperconfident individuals proposed a way out by blaming scapegoats and promising exciting, almost miraculous change. The results proved catastrophic.\n\nNo, America is not 1930s Germany, not by a long shot. But the images of Europe after World War I keep coming to mind. The parallels are not precise, but we hear the echoes, see the shadows. We should heed the warnings.\n\nWho would have thought that in the 21st century, American voters would be seriously considering as presidential candidates a neofascist and a neosocialist -- throwbacks to the old, failed utopias? Talk about fashionably retro!\n\nLooking at Donald Trump stoking his supporters into a frenzy, attacking \"them\" -- whoever \"they\" happen to be at the moment -- vowing to return American to greatness and then flashing his self-satisfied smile, the mind harks back to those grainy newsreel images of Benito Mussolini , the theatrical Italian \"Duce,\" the leader, who became the central figure of fascist Italy a century ago.\n\nIs Trump a fascist? No, not quite. In fact, Trump doesn't propose anything close to a coherent ideology. He's a Trumpist. And we're only learning what that means, along with him, as he makes it up.\n\nFascists viewed the nation as an organism superseding the needs of the individual. That does not match Trump's rhetoric. But fascists also ridiculed and suppressed the opposition, and they embraced a level of authoritarianism that we can only hope Trump would reject. But who knows?\n\nCult of personality\n\nOne distinct similarity between Trump and the populist politicians of the 1930s is his ability to create and draw power from a cult of personality. The Republican front-runner's main campaign platform is that he will make everything OK. Trump will fix it. Trump will make America great again. How? That's not clear. He will do it by the power of his Trumpness. And we know it will work because look at him; look at how successful he is. Look how strong and fearless he is. There's very little in the way of substance. There's just a lot of Trump.\n\nAnd to prove how much America needs him, he reminds voters that America is in deep, deep trouble. He hints at nefarious conspiracies; he highlights every problem and every threat, making it sound as ominous as possible. And then he vows to tackle it without mercy, even if it means committing war crimes, violating the Constitution , and expelling millions of people from the country. That, incidentally, would create the digital color version of those 1930s deportations : armed U.S. security forces (very armed) leading frightened people to the trains. (Or would he make them walk across the border?)\n\nCharisma is a dangerous power in the wrong hands. When combined with popular discontent and disorienting change it can make a travesty of democracy and it can disfigure a society.\n\nValidating prejudices\n\nTrump has an uncanny ability to bring out the worst instincts in people. He validates the prejudices that people try to erase from their hearts. Trump seems alarmingly reluctant to distance himself from support from the KKK. Instead of debating ideas and policies, Trump insults and mocks people. He routinely appears to advocate violence against protesters, another disturbing throwback to the 1930s, and he draws a sharp distinction between \"us\" and \"them.\"\n\nWe don't know what kind of a president he would be. It's hard to imagine he would continue to speak of punching people in the face, or that he would continue to mock people with disabilities, or follow through with any of his illegal or nonsensical proposals as a head of state. But there's no telling. He has already defied all predictions.\n\nIn a new turn of events since Thursday's GOP debate, Trump's opponents, who had seemed intimidated by Trump's savaging of Jeb Bush, have finally decided to take him on. It's good to see them challenging his empty offerings, but it's unsettling to see Sen. Marco Rubio also resorting to personality-driven attacks, eliciting uproarious laughter from his supporters. Despite the laughs, it's a sad sight.\n\nSanders found a scapegoat\n\nThen there's the other end of the political spectrum: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the longtime Independent socialist politician now running as a Democrat.\n\nPhotos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlight Photos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlight U.S. Sen.

He is not advocating the takeover by the state of the means of production and the abolition of private property. But in the spirit of his socialist convictions, he too has found a scapegoat for all that ails America. Sanders would squeeze the rich, for whom he does not hide his contempt. In the manner of a demagogue, he declared , \"Fraud is the business model of Wall Street.\"\n\nSanders proposes social programs containing the seed of potentially useful ideas, and he undoubtedly points to very real flaws in the system. But his overall approach, if it could ever be implemented, has the makings of an economic disaster . We know that because it was already tried.\n\nHillary Clinton's overwhelming victory in South Carolina may mark the beginning of the end for the Sanders movement, perhaps a sign that voters know Sanders' idealistic offerings, no matter how appealing, are disconnected from what is possible.\n\nHis plans would create deficits so large that there are not enough zeroes in calculator displays to hold them. His plans would produce deficits of between $18 trillion to $30 trillion (with a T) from new spending. You can squeeze the Wall Street billionaires as hard as you want. Even they don't have that much money. And while you're at it, see what happens to the economy if you impose the taxes required to even start those programs.\n\nSanders running honorable but mistaken campaign\n\nBoth Trump and Sanders are advocating granting much greater powers to the government. To be sure, Sanders appears to be aiming to force discussion of important issues in the campaign, and, unlike Trump, has run an honorable, throughtful and respectful campaign.\n\nTrump would apparently expand government to secure the country from enemies and from immigrants. Sanders would do it to pay for social plans. Both positions carry a faint whiff of Nirvana, telling voters who feel unsettled -- by growing inequality, expensive unwon wars, and a sense that America is starting to fall behind -- that they have an answer to repair the country, to make them feel safe.\n\nAgain, this is not Europe in the 1930s, but the European experience carries a warning: Beware of politicians offering easy fixes. Rousing speeches are no guarantee of a better future.",

    "text": "Los Angeles (CNN) As superhero team-ups go, Marvel and Netflix continue to make a pretty powerful pair. Enter, on the heels of \"Daredevil\" and \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Marvel's Luke Cage,\" which closely adheres to that gritty formula and should win its own loyal legion of fans behind Mike Colter's imposing presence in the title role.\n\nMoreover, there's symbolic importance in \"Luke Cage's\" arrival, representing a franchise built around an African-American superhero -- described by first-time showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker as \"a bulletproof black guy\" -- before \"Black Panther\" can hit the big screen. (Disclosure: Coker is a former colleague from our overlapping stints at the Los Angeles Times.)\n\nThese streaming shows built around lower-profile characters operate on a parallel tier of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, referencing the theatrical world populated by \"The Avengers\" but operating in a much more spare, scaled-down environment.\n\nAs a result, the title character (who previously appeared in \"Jessica Jones\") can be introduced gradually. The start is so leisurely, in fact, that the origin story -- explaining how Cage came to be nearly indestructible and incredibly strong, via the ever-popular experiment gone wrong -- doesn't come until the fourth episode.\n\nThen again, with Netflix, spooning out plot sometimes just makes for a better binge. Set in Harlem, the low-key intro finds Luke Cage sweeping up in a barbershop, one of several odd jobs he takes to make ends meet. And while the owner (Frankie Faison) knows his secret and urges Luke to use his powers \"helping people\" like those better-known heroes, he resists the temptation, harboring past emotional wounds even if he's mostly impervious to physical pain.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "Kristie Lu Stout is the host of \"On China,\" a talk show on CNN International. The latest episode looks at China's military.\n\nHong Kong (CNN) It's the nagging glitch in the US-China relationship that was inevitably mentioned during the first US presidential debate this week between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton -- cyber warfare.\n\n(Or, as Trump put it, \" the cyber \").\n\nDuring the debate, Trump questioned whether Russia was indeed behind a series of cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee -- a conclusion that US officials and his election rival have reached.\n\n\"She says, 'Russia, Russia, Russia,'\" said Trump. \"It could be China.\"\n\n'Cloak-and-dagger to bits-and-bytes'\n\nIn the dark world of cyber-espionage, the finger of blame has often been pointed at China.\n\nEarlier this year, China's cyber spies were accused of hacking into dozens of workstations and servers at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nLast year, Chinese hacking was blamed for the massive data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management which compromised the data of over 21 million people.\n\nAnd in May 2014, US federal prosecutors indicted members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for cyber-espionage for economic gain.\n\nChina has all along denied the allegations of state-sponsored hacking. But analysts say China's cyber operations are an active threat.\n\n\"Military intelligence has rapidly moved from cloak-and-dagger to bits-and-bytes over the last fifteen years... and China's no exception to that,\" says Bryce Boland, Asia-Pacific CTO of FireEye, a cybersecurity firm.\n\n\"China has been developing its capabilities within the PLA for a number of years, going back at least a decade. And their capabilities have now also been brought together into a single, strategic organization that is essentially a new branch of the military.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Waging war in the information age Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Waging war in the information age 01:03\n\nShift in behavior\n\nChina is of course not the only actor in this era of cyber warfare.\n\nBut it has taken a significant step forward with the United States to establish some ground rules in a new domain of conflict with no widely-held norms.\n\nDuring President Xi Jinping's state visit to the US last year, the China and the US formally agreed not to conduct or knowingly support economic cyber-espionage\n\n\"I think China, after that, has tried to comply with that agreement,\" says Tong Zhao of the Beijing-based Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.\n\n\"China increasingly realizes it is in China's interests to promote a rule-based system.\"\n\nAnd since the agreement, FireEye has observed a significant change in Chinese cyber activity.\n\n\"We've seen a shift in behavior since the Obama-Xi agreement. And that shift in behavior has resulted in a decrease in attacks against US and Western organizations for the purposes of stealing their intellectual property,\" says Boland.\n\n\"We've almost seen a pivot towards Asia. We've seen more targeted attacks now focused on information gathering and intelligence collection from countries on the periphery of China -- anyone with a land boundary or involved in a maritime dispute. And that kind of activity is much more focused on intelligence.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Can China fight and win a war? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Can China fight and win a war? 01:21\n\nChina's cyber-spies target Asia\n\nChina's cyber-spies are pivoting away from stealing US trade secrets as they move towards gathering intelligence in a region fraught with geopolitical tension.\n\nTake Taiwan, for instance.\n\nRelations with Taipei and Beijing have been tense since the landslide election of Tsai Ing-Wen, Taiwan's first female president. Her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has traditionally leaned in favor of formal independence from China.\n\nAfter the DPP's election win, its website was compromised and replaced with a spoofed site to collect data on visitors.\n\nAnd then, there's Hong Kong.\n\nTwo years after Hong Kong's pro-democracy \"Umbrella Movement,\" the city's first legislative elections since the mass demonstrations provided a platform for a small but vocal independence movement -- much to the chagrin of Beijing.\n\nBefore the election, two Hong Kong government agencies were targeted by cyber-attackers using new malware tools.\n\nAccording to FireEye, both incidents were the work of Chinese state-sponsored hackers.\n\n\"We know those that those attacks were originated from China... they were clearly politically motivated attacks,\" says Boland.\n\n\"The only logical consequence is that they are operated by a group of people who had a political activity to conduct, so we believe they were state-sponsored.\"\n\nNot all attacks officially sanctioned\n\nBut not all hack attacks originating from China have the official red seal of approval.\n\nAfter an international court ruled that China did not have a historic right to a disputed area in the South China Sea, flight information screens at Vietnam's two biggest airports were hacked to show messages criticizing the Philippines and Vietnam and their territorial claims in the region.\n\nAnalyst Tong Zhao is convinced that the Vietnam airport hack was not the work of Chinese state agents.\n\n\"We used to assume that China is a country having a very centralized political system -- the central government must be in control of everything. I think that assumption is inaccurate,\" Zhao says.\n\nAnd he's right. As powerful as it may be, China is not a single monolith. It's a vast system of many different actors -- military or civilian, state-backed or for-hire.\n\nBut China's many cyber actors can come together for a common goal -- to advance China's security interests and its standing in the information age.",

I had just begun a personal project of challenging my lifelong assumption that God exists.\n\nYou see, I had been a Seventh-day Adventist pastor for 19 years. I resigned from my pastoral position the year before , but now I stepped away from my faith altogether. It was a gut-wrenching decision but I couldn't see any other way to find peace and clarity. I encountered major theological differences with my denomination and evangelical Christianity in general, including the way it marginalizes women and LGBT people.\n\nRyan Bell\n\nI questioned the problem of evils and God's general silence and inactivity. I sought out more liberal theologies and found them to be the slow death of God. Now I had to face the very real possibility that God does not exist.\n\nWould I discover that God was present and involved, or would I discover that the whole web of theological claims I had embraced and helped develop were false?\n\nI was feeling small against the beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent sea before me. Then I started to feel grateful. \"What are the chances that I would be sitting on this beach right now, looking at this remarkable scene of beauty?\" I thought.

Also, text highlights and a transcript of the discussion are below.\n\nMANDATORY CREDIT: CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\n\nContacts: Lauren Pratapas \u2014 Lauren.Pratapas@turner.com; 202.465.6666; Brooke Lorenz- Brooke.Lorenz@turner.com\n\nCNN STORY\n\nSanders: Trump's taxes prove system rigged\n\nSanders brushes off leaked Clinton criticism\n\nVIDEO HIGHLIGHTS\n\nSanders slams Trump over NYT report on taxes\n\nBernie Sanders reacts to leaked Clinton audio\n\nTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\n\nSanders on Gary Johnson's 2nd \u201cAleppo moment\u201d: You know, that wasn't the most impressive interview I have ever heard. But I think, more importantly than that, people make mistakes doing interviews. Look at his point of view on issues like the environment, on climate change, on the economy. And I think, if any of the people voted for me take a hard look what he stands for, I think - and understand where he's coming from, they will not be supporting - not be supporting him.\n\nSanders on The New York Times report that Trump has not paid federal income taxes for 18 years: Let me get your reaction to this news about Donald Trump and not paying federal income taxes. Some Trump supporters would argue, why should he pay any more taxes than the law requires him to. What do you think? SANDERS: Well, you know, Jake, this is exactly why so many millions of Americans are frustrated, they are angry, they are disgusted at what they see is a corrupt political system in this country\u2026 So, Trump goes around and says, hey, I'm worth billions, I'm a successful businessman, but I don't pay any taxes. But, you, you make 15 bucks an hour, you pay the taxes, not me. That's why people are angry and want real change in this country.\n\nSanders on Clinton's hacked audio calling him a \"false promise\": TAPPER:\u2026What was your reaction when you heard that, calling your ideas indefensible, saying that you were selling them false promises? SANDERS: Well, two things. If you listen to the whole discussion that she had, a very important point that she made is that a lot of young people who went into debt, worked very hard to get a good education get out of school and can't find jobs commensurate with the education that they received. And there's a lot of unhappiness about young people. And this is an issue that we must address. But the bottom line here is that I think that what Secretary Clinton and I have done since the election, since the primary nominating process, we have worked together in a number of areas\u2026And, by the way, apropos to Donald Trump not paying any taxes, she's come up with an estate tax proposal which will ask the very wealthiest people in this country, wealthiest families in this country to start paying their fair share. TAPPER: Yes. I get that, Senator. But she's calling other ideas you pitched, not the ones that you two are working on together, but she called other ones false promises and said what you were doing was indefensible. That must bother you. SANDERS: Well, look, we're - of course it does. But we're in the middle of a campaign. And I - trust me. If you go to some of the statements that I made about Hillary Clinton, you can see real differences. So we have differences. There's nothing to be surprised about. That's what a campaign is all about.\n\nSanders on audio from The Washington Free Beacon of Clinton describing his supporters: (AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON: Some are new to politics completely. They are children of the great recession, and they are living in their parents' basement. So, if you're feeling that you're consigned to being a barista or, you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot and doesn't have much of a ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. TAPPER: What was your reaction to that, sir? SANDERS: Well, I agree with her. What she's saying is what I suggested a moment ago. There are young people who went deeply into debt, worked very hard to get a good education, and yet they are getting out of school and they can't find decent-paying jobs. And that's a major problem. They are living in their parents' basements. And that's the point there. So, I personally do believe we do need a political revolution, that we do need to transform the society, create decent-paying jobs, make sure that Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change, transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, and have pay equity for women. So, I think that Secretary Clinton - and, by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago - she's prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration\u2026 TAPPER: Senator, what would you say to a Bernie Sanders supporter who listens to that tape and thinks, that sounds condescending, to call me a basement-dwelling barista that's buying false promises from Bernie Sanders, and I think she's just using Bernie Sanders to get elected? What is your message to that Bernie Sanders supporter? SANDERS: This is what the message would be. Take a hard look, not at Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Take a hard look at the needs of the American people. And issue by issue, whether it is climate change, whether it is Citizens United, the need to overturn that, whether it is pay equity for women, whether it is raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, a tax system that says to Trump and his friends they are going start paying their fair share of taxes, look at Clinton's positions, look at Trump's positions, understand that one or the other of those two will be the next president of the United States. And after you take a hard look at those two candidates and their issues, I think the conclusion that the vast majority of people will reach is that Clinton is far and away the superior candidate.\n\nSanders on Deutsche Bank\u2019s $14 billion fine for its mortgage-lending activities: TAPPER: \u2026As you may know, the Clintons received almost a million dollars from Deutsche Bank for delivering four speeches behind closed doors. In light of the fine and the ongoing investigation, should they return that money? SANDERS: Well, that's for them to decide. But what this tells me and what this whole Wells Fargo fiasco tells me, Jake, is what I have been saying all along, is that the business model of the largest financial institutions in this country and, in fact, around the world is fraud. It is fraud. That's what they do. Occasionally, they get caught after making huge amounts of money. And that's I believe why we need to reestablish Glass-Steagall legislation and why I believe we need to break up these large financial institutions. We cannot continue to tolerate, whether it's Deutsche Bank, whether it's Wells Fargo, whether it's Bank of America, the kind of fraudulent activity that we have seen for so long.\n\nFULL TRANSCRIPT\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, D.C., where the state of our union is taxed.\n\nOvernight, \"The New York Times\" publishing a copy of Donald Trump's 1995 tax returns, or at least some pages from it, revealing a $916 million loss from failed business projects. The law would allow him, theoretically, to use those losses to offset taxes on new income for as long as 18 years, \"The Times\" report.\n\nSo, did Donald Trump pay any federal income taxes? His campaign's response - quote - \"Mr. Trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes\" - unquote.\n\nThat statement, you might notice, does not mention paying income taxes or dispute the authenticity of \"The Times\"-obtained document. But they do say it was illegally obtained.\n\nJoining me now is former presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is a supporter of Hillary Clinton.\n\nSenator Sanders, good to see you, as always.\n\nLet me get your reaction to this news about Donald Trump and not paying federal income taxes. Some Trump supporters would argue, why should he pay any more taxes than the law requires him to. What do you think?\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Well, you know, Jake, this is exactly why so many millions of Americans are frustrated, they are angry, they are disgusted at what they see is a corrupt political system in this country.\n\nSo, what you have, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, in the last 16 years, we have seen a 10-fold increase in the number of billionaires. And at the same time, many of these billionaires have loopholes that their lobbyists and their friends on Capitol Hill provide to them which enable them to avoid taxes, in some cases, not paying a nickel in taxes.\n\nSo, you have got the middle-class people working longer hours for low wages. They pay their taxes. They support their schools. They support their infrastructure. They support the military. But the billionaires, no, they don't have to do that, because they have their friends on Capitol Hill. They pay zero in taxes.\n\nSo, Trump goes around and says, hey, I'm worth billions, I'm a successful businessman, but I don't pay any taxes. But, you, you make 15 bucks an hour, you pay the taxes, not me.\n\nThat's why people are angry and want real change in this country.\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk about that.\n\nYou hit the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton this week to promote your new joint college plan.\n\nTake a listen what Hillary Clinton said about you and your supporters back in February when she was at a closed door fund-raiser. I want to make it clear this is just an excerpt of these comments. And it came from an e-mail hack. Take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nHILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's just a deep desire to believe that, you know, we can have free college, free health care.\n\nIt's a false promise. But I don't think you tell idealistic people, particularly young people, that they bought into a false promise.\n\nHis ideas are indefensible.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: You are out there working very, very hard for Secretary Clinton, trying convince your supporters to back someone that many of them did not trust.\n\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that, calling your ideas indefensible, saying that you were selling them false promises?\n\nSANDERS: Well, two things.\n\nIf you listen to the whole discussion that she had, a very important point that she made is that a lot of young people who went into debt, worked very hard to get a good education get out of school and can't find jobs commensurate with the education that they received.\n\nAnd there's a lot of unhappiness about young people. And this is an issue that we must address. But the bottom line here is that I think that what Secretary Clinton and I have done since the election, since the primary nominating process, we have worked together in a number of areas.\n\nSecretary Clinton has worked with me to make certain that public colleges and universities become tuition-free for all families earning $125,000 or less, that we double funding for community health centers, which means that we will have access to primary care for millions more Americans.\n\nAnd, by the way, apropos to Donald Trump not paying any taxes, she's come up with an estate tax proposal which will ask the very wealthiest people in this country, wealthiest families in this country to start paying their fair share.\n\nTAPPER: Yes. I get that, Senator. But she's calling other ideas you pitched, not the ones that you two are working on together, but she called other ones false promises and said what you were doing was indefensible. That must bother you.\n\nSANDERS: Well, look, we're - of course it does.\n\nBut we're in the middle of a campaign. And I - trust me. If you go to some of the statements that I made about Hillary Clinton, you can see real differences. So we have differences. There's nothing to be surprised about. That's what a campaign is all about.\n\nTAPPER: She also said this about your supporters. And let me also remind people you should go and listen - go to \"The Washington Free Beacon\" Web site. They have the whole comments. You should listen to them all. But she said this about your supporters.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON: Some are new to politics completely. They are children of the great recession, and they are living in their parents' basement.\n\nSo, if you're feeling that you're consigned to being a barista or, you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot and doesn't have much of a ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: What was your reaction to that, sir?\n\nSANDERS: Well, I agree with her.\n\nWhat she's saying is what I suggested a moment ago.

And that's the point there.\n\nSo, I personally do believe we do need a political revolution, that we do need to transform the society, create decent-paying jobs, make sure that Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change, transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, and have pay equity for women.\n\nSo, I think that Secretary Clinton - and, by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago - she's prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration.\n\nAnd, on top of that, unlike Donald Trump, she understands that Citizens United Supreme Court decision is undermining American democracy. It has got to be overturned. She will be supporting a constitutional amendment to do that, so that billionaires cannot continue buying elections in this country.\n\nTAPPER: Senator, what would you say to a Bernie Sanders supporter who listens to that tape and thinks, that sounds condescending, to call me a basement-dwelling barista that's buying false promises from Bernie Sanders, and I think she's just using Bernie Sanders to get elected?\n\nWhat is your message to that Bernie Sanders supporter?\n\nSANDERS: This is what the message would be.\n\nTake a hard look, not at Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Take a hard look at the needs of the American people. And issue by issue, whether it is climate change, whether it is Citizens United, the need to overturn that, whether it is pay equity for women, whether it is raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, a tax system that says to Trump and his friends they are going start paying their fair share of taxes, look at Clinton's positions, look at Trump's positions, understand that one or the other of those two will be the next president of the United States.\n\nAnd after you take a hard look at those two candidates and their issues, I think the conclusion that the vast majority of people will reach is that Clinton is far and away the superior candidate.\n\nTAPPER: A lot of Clinton advisers are worried, as I'm sure you know, that a sizable number of your former supporters might go to a third-party candidate such as Jill Stein or Gary Johnson.\n\nGary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, struggled this week to name a foreign world leader whom he respects.\n\nTake a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: Who is your favorite foreign leader?\n\nGARY JOHNSON, LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Who is my favorite...\n\nMATTHEWS: Any - just name anywhere in the country - any one of the continents, any country. Name one foreign leader that you respect and look up to.\n\nYou have got to do this. Anywhere. Any continent, Canada, Mexico, Europe over there, Asia, South America, Africa. Name a foreign leader that you respect.\n\nJOHNSON: I guess I'm having an Aleppo moment. The former president of Mexico...\n\nMATTHEWS: No. Which one?\n\nJOHNSON: I'm having a brain - I'm having a brain...\n\nMATTHEWS: Well, name anybody.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: I know you disagree with Gary Johnson on a range of policy issues, where you and Secretary Clinton agree. Do you think he's qualified to be president?\n\nSANDERS: You know, that wasn't the most impressive interview I have ever heard.\n\nBut I think, more importantly than that, people make mistakes doing interviews. Look at his point of view on issues like the environment, on climate change, on the economy. And I think, if any of the people voted for me take a hard look what he stands for, I think - and understand where he's coming from, they will not be supporting - not be supporting him.\n\nTAPPER: I want to ask you about Deutsche Bank.\n\nObviously, as you know, two weeks ago federal regulators slapped Deutsche Bank with a $14 billion fine for its mortgage-lending activities during the housing bubble between 2012 and 2014.\n\nAs you may know, the Clintons received almost a million dollars from Deutsche Bank for delivering four speeches behind closed doors. In light of the fine and the ongoing investigation, should they return that money?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that's for them to decide.\n\nBut what this tells me and what this whole Wells Fargo fiasco tells me, Jake, is what I have been saying all along, is that the business model of the largest financial institutions in this country and, in fact, around the world is fraud. It is fraud.\n\nThat's what they do. Occasionally, they get caught after making huge amounts of money. And that's I believe why we need to reestablish Glass-Steagall legislation and why I believe we need to break up these large financial institutions. We cannot continue to tolerate, whether it's Deutsche Bank, whether it's Wells Fargo, whether it's Bank of America, the kind of fraudulent activity that we have seen for so long.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, sir, you were critical of the Clinton Foundation taking money from governments like Saudi Arabia during the primaries.\n\nThere's still talk of the Clinton Foundation continuing even if Secretary Clinton becomes elected president. Chelsea Clinton is planning to stay on board.\n\nDo you think that that poses a potential conflict of interests, and should the Clinton Foundation shut down if Secretary Clinton becomes president?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that's obviously something that the Clinton family is going to have to determine. But I think it does raise serious questions if foreign governments, for example, are making contributions to a foundation tied closely to what I hope will be - who I hope will be the next president of the United States.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Bernie Sanders, we always enjoy having you on. Thank you so much. Happy new year to you, sir.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\n###END INTERVIEW###",

    "text": "(CNN) If you're a young country aiming to make an impact in the world of sport then an Olympic gold medal and World Cup debut offer the perfect start.\n\nFor Kosovo, which gained independence from Serbia in 2008, the past year has proved the most significant in its sporting history.\n\nJudoka Majlinda Kelmendi won Kosovo's first ever Olympic medal -- a gold, no less -- in Rio while the nation's football team was authorized to compete for a place in the 2018 World Cup in Russia last May.\n\nFor President Hashim Thaci, these two events proved sport can break down barriers where politics and diplomacy sometimes fail.\n\nSport and politics\n\n\"In sport we are moving much quicker than we are in politics,\" President Thaci told CNN in an exclusive interview.\n\n\"Sport is opening doors for further success in politics through giving a positive image of Kosovo. Today the whole world knows about Majlinda Kelmendi.\n\nKosovo's President Hashim Thaci hands over the national flag to the Kosovar judoka Majlinda Kelmendi.\n\n\"In Brazil, which hasn't yet recognized Kosovo as a state, we participated in the Olympics, the Kosovo flag was flying in the village, and the anthem was played.\n\n\"At the moment there are 112 countries which recognizes Kosovo but our aim is to be recognized by all member states of the United Nations.\n\n\"Our main obstacle is the UN security council but I believe soon enough we will be a member of the European Union, NATO and the UN.\"\n\nStruggle\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia 10 years after a bloody conflict between Serb forces and Kosovar-Albanian rebels.\n\nThe war between 1998 and 1999 led to thousands of deaths and the displacement of nearly 90% of Kosovo's population\n\nIt was between 1997 and 1999 that Thaci came to prominence as a leading figure in the Kosovo Liberation Army and even took part in peace negotiations.\n\nHis transition from a revolutionary into a politician eventually led to him to becoming prime minister upon independence and recognizing a lifelong dream.\n\nPresident Thaci was part of the Kosovo Liberation Army during the late 1990s.\n\nThe creation of an independent state was a moment, Thaci says, he \"never ever doubted,\" would happen.\n\n\"Of course, our dream was to have our own state which was to be equal and free just like any other people or state in Europe,\" he said.\n\n\"Finally, we have our own state, the dream is a reality and we have our own national team which can play internationally.\n\n\"The team is a symbol of our state, it represents our identity, our flag, our national anthem, it's a source of pride. It's something which makes me proud to be Kosovar.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Judo champ thrills Kosovo with first ever gold medal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Judo champ thrills Kosovo with first ever gold medal 02:51\n\nEmotion\n\nKosovo held Finland to a 1-1 draw in Turku last month.\n\nElected president in May 2016, Thaci has enjoyed Kosovo's rise on the sporting stage.\n\nLast month, Thaci was in Turku, Finland, to watch Kosovo claim a 1-1 draw in its first game of the qualifying campaign.\n\nValon Berisha's penalty secured a first ever point and led to wild celebrations with thousands of Kosovo fans celebrating at the stadium.\n\nIt was a remarkable result given that six of the players in the squad had only been cleared to play by FIFA a matter of hours before kick off.\n\n\"I had profound emotions while watching the game,\" Thaci said.\n\n\"Sport in Kosovo in general was isolated for more than two decades and it's only now that the people can dream and make those dreams a reality.\n\nValon Berisha scored his country's first ever World Cup qualifying goal.\n\n\"Winning Olympic gold closed the chapter of isolation for our athletes. It has opened opportunities for Kosovar talent and youth. This in turn will increase the quality of talent in athletes and also the sporting structure in the country.\n\n\"Now we just started investing in young athletes and we can start identifying talent and work in providing them with infrastructure and training they need to become world class athletes.\"\n\nGame time\n\nSome 11,000 Kosovo fans will travel to Albania for the game with Croatia.\n\nOn Thursday, Thaci will travel to Loro Borici Stadium in Albania, where his country faces Croatia in its second World Cup qualifying match.\n\nHis son, Endrit, a Real Madrid supporter, will also be there along with thousands of Kosovo fans who will make the short trip across the border.\n\nWork on Kosovo's national stadium in the capital city of Pristina is expected to be finished by March, but for now Albania is the only logical place to hold a \"home\" game.\n\nNot that it worries Thaci -- he cannot wait for kickoff.\n\nKosovo played its first friendly game back in 2014 against Haiti.\n\n\"It's a historic game for the country,\" he said.\n\n\"Croatia plays world class football but the ball is round, it's the same for both teams. I believe we can compete with Croatia with our talent.\n\n\"What's more important is that this is a game between two friendly countries. It will be a celebration, a victory for sport because both nations were victims of war.\"",

Now, a local professional clown is speaking out, she said it's no laughing matter.\n\n\"It breaks my heart that people are being afraid of clowns,\" said Linda Greene.\n\nGreene has been Greenie the clown for nearly 30 years in Midland. She said the sightings lately aren't real clowns, real clowns don't want to scare anyone.\n\n\"That would be like taking a doctor's coat and putting it on and saying you're a doctor,\" said Greene. \"That doesn't make you a doctor just because you have the outfit.\"\n\nMidland police said they have confirmed two sightings of someone dressed as a clown in Midland. Midland Police Department Chief Price Robinson said it has also been buzzing on social media.\n\n\"It's not illegal to go down the street as a clown or dressed up in a Halloween costume,\" said Robinson. \"But if it's anything illegal or against the law we would like to know about it so we can go check it out.\"\n\nGreen said she's been asked to scare people in costume before but refused.\n\n\"I've had a few calls in my career that wanted me to come to a party and then said, 'So and so is scared of clowns and that's why we're having you.'

I had one person said they would pay me double and I said, 'No, you don't have enough money.'\"\n\nMidland police said they have never seen this nationwide trend locally. They are asking the community to let them handle any encounters with the suspicious clowns.\n\nAs for Greene?

    "text": "Tuesday night's vice presidential debate drew a much smaller audience than the VP debates in 2012 and 2008.\n\nAbout 37.2 million people tuned in to the nine television channels that carried the debate live, according to Nielsen.\n\nAn unknown number of others streamed the debate on the web in ways that aren't counted by Nielsen.\n\nNo one expected the running mate debate to come anywhere close to last week's Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton match-up. About 84 million tuned in to that debate via TV, making it the most-watched debate in American history.\n\nBut it may be considered disappointing that Tuesday's Mike Pence-Tim Kaine debate did not match past VP totals.\n\nThe 2012 VP debate, between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, averaged 51.4 million viewers.\n\nThe Biden-Sarah Palin debate in 2008 ranks as the most-watched VP debate ever, with 69.9 million viewers, largely attributed to curiosity about Palin.\n\nThe 2004 Dick Cheney-John Edwards match-up drew 43.5 million.\n\nTo find a lower-rated VP debate than Tuesday, you have to go back to 2000, when 28.5 million people watched Cheney and Joe Lieberman debate.\n\nPolitical analysts noted that the two running mates aren't as well known as past V.P. contenders like Biden. This may have dampened overall interest in the debate.\n\nStill, the combined audience of 37 million is a huge number for any single event on TV -- even bigger than this year's Academy Awards. It was a high-profile opportunity for both candidates, and the media consensus was that Pence prevailed.\n\nEarly overnight ratings suggested a total audience surpassing 40 million viewers. But more detailed data later in the day showed a drop-off in the 10 p.m. hour -- during the debate's last half-hour -- that dragged down the overall average.\n\nThis suggests some viewers were turned off by the back-and-forth between the two candidates.\n\nTrump-Clinton, on the other hand, had a steadier audience from start to finish.\n\nNBC had the biggest audience during the V.P. debate, with about 7 million viewers; CBS was second with 6.5 million viewers. CBS News anchor Elaine Quijano was the moderator.\n\nABC and Fox News averaged 6.1 million, CNN averaged 4.2 million, MSNBC averaged 3.1 million, the Fox broadcast network averaged 2.2 million, and PBS averaged 1.4 million.\n\nThe debate audience skewed older, with only 3.4 million of the 37.1 million viewers coming from the 18- to 34-year-old demographic -- the millennials Clinton and Kaine are courting.\n\nAbout 12.4 million of the viewers were in the 25- to 54-year-old demo.\n\nNielsen's ratings do not count live streaming. Pence-Kaine reached hundreds of thousands of people via live streaming, but the concurrent viewership on YouTube was just a fraction of what it was for Trump-Clinton last week.\n\nUnlike in 2012, the debate was not shown on the country's two biggest Spanish language networks, Univision and Telemundo. This absence further diminished the total viewership of the debate.",

He has endorsed Hillary Clinton in this year's Democratic campaign. Wade is an entrepreneur and president of a global business development firm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Last week, Donald Trump, running as Savior-in-Chief, tried to appeal to the African-American electorate by attending his first black church, Detroit's Great Faith Ministries. Though it took him long enough, at least Trump finally spoke to black folks rather than past them.\n\nThat said, he has yet to show any real understanding of the plight of African-Americans or to lay out a comprehensive plan to address their concerns. Given his racist history -- from being sued for housing discrimination in the 1970s to embracing avowed white supremacists in the present day -- he has some serious work to do if he wants to win over African-American voters.\n\nThe problem is, in addition to Trump's checkered past, he has done little to woo black voters since declaring his candidacy -- and he has had plenty of opportunities, beginning with the primary in South Carolina, where blacks account for nearly 30% of the population.\n\nIf Trump was serious about education reform, he could have visited crumbling, underfunded and predominantly black schools along Interstate 95 known as the \" Corridor of Shame \" and unveiled his plan for America's public schools.\n\nIf he was committed to helping minority businesses, he could have toured manufacturing plants in Greenville and explained his plan for expanding their access to capital and corporate supply chains.\n\nIf he was sincere about healing divisions, he could have worshiped at Mother Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, where a man who police said wanted to start a race war admitted killing nine churchgoers, including the pastor -- my friend and state senator Clementa Pinckney -- and talked about racial reconciliation.\n\nBut Trump did none of those things. And since then, Trump also declined invitations to speak before the National Urban League, the NAACP and the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nTo date, Trump's only major pronouncement has been the need for a \" civil rights agenda for our time ,\" but he has failed to offer one, except a call to fight crime and expand charter schools. While seeking to temper his racially divisive image to center-right whites and suburban moms, he has reinforced the very stereotypes that blacks have worked for decades to overcome. Everyone is not impoverished, uneducated, jobless and getting shot.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump links Clinton to crime in voter outreach strategy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump links Clinton to crime in voter outreach strategy 02:40\n\nSurely the Trump campaign didn't believe that his outreach strategy -- void of apologizing for his condescending tone or offering any prescriptive policy solutions -- would increase his support among blacks. Today's African-Americans are too smart to fall for that \" okey-doke .\" They are more sophisticated and knowledgeable, rightfully expecting candidates to earn their votes. Millennials, in particular, are more analytical and independent , less likely to engage in group think. They stay dialed in on politics through social media, and are more interested in accountability on issues like criminal justice reform than traditional church stump speeches.\n\nStill, the most important, lasting way to win black voters is by building trusting, respectful relationships and addressing their needs. Despite job growth, the unemployment rate is 9.5% for African-Americans -- twice the national average -- and 6.6% for Hispanics. According to the Corporation for Economic Development and the Institute for Policy Studies, at this rate it will take black households 228 years and Hispanic households 84 years to close the wealth gap with whites. Baltimore, Detroit and Chicago are all recent portraits of America's racial and socioeconomic imbalance. Crime and violence, widespread across segregated black neighborhoods, is rooted in concentrated poverty. With these problems staring him squarely in the face, Trump, up to now, has looked the other way.\n\nLet me be clear: It would be unfair and unrealistic to expect a president to singlehandedly heal America's socioeconomic ills. But we should expect our president to have a plan to ensure everyone has a seat at America's economic table. What minorities need is not more rhetoric and research, but policies that drive private investment to their communities to develop high-growth enterprises and raise wages, in sectors such as energy, technology and manufacturing.\n\nClinton gets that, and has proposed a thoughtful Economic Revitalization Initiative , which includes $50 billion to create jobs in struggling communities, $20 billion to support youth jobs, $5 billion for prison re-entry programs, and $25 billion to support entrepreneurs and increase private investment in underserved communities.\n\nAs successful a businessman as he claims to be, Trump should have gotten it long ago. But it's not too late for him to demonstrate leadership. He can start by committing to improve his own company's record -- increasing the number of blacks at executive levels, building businesses in minority communities and hiring minority contractors.\n\nJUST WATCHED Spike Lee blasts Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Spike Lee blasts Trump 02:49\n\nThen, he could lay out a plan that includes freeing up capital for minority-owned businesses, incentives for large companies to locate in distressed areas, pathways for more minority-owned firms to do government work and access foreign markets, and investments in STEM, entrepreneurship and job training.\n\nMany have framed this election as a disturbing and negative result of America's ongoing racial and ethnic transformation. But minorities represent more than votes. They are key drivers of America's economy and the future of the country's workforce, which has been changing far more significantly than its politics for the past four decades.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBy 2020, the white working-age population will have declined by 19 percentage points. The minority working-age population will have doubled to 37% -- and during the next president's term. The fact that minorities will make up more than a third of the workforce means our next president must address the economic conditions of people of color.\n\nSo while Trump swayed to the choir music at Great Faith Ministries and praised black Christians, it is not enough. He has to \"walk the walk\" with African-Americans. He has a long road to travel -- and little time to get there.",

    "text": "(CNN) My father came from that old-school league of golf enthusiasts. He was part of Arnie's Army, legend Arnold Palmer's legion of fans, and he loved to sit around the bar at his local American Legion telling stories about guys like Fuzzy Zoeller and Lee Trevino as if he knew them.\n\nTrevino was once hit by lightning in 1975, and my pops used to repeat Trevino's joke that he should've been holding a 1-iron at the time.\n\n\"Not even God can hit a 1-iron,\" he'd say.\n\nPalmer and Zoeller were his favorites, though. My dad had little use for snobbery, and he felt guys like Palmer and Zoeller were everymen who made the oft-lofty game of golf accessible to regular folks.\n\nThat meant more to him than whether they could crush a drive or drop an approach shot on a dime (and they both could in their days).\n\nSkipping class, heading to Augusta\n\nIn 2003, my last year of grad school at the University of Georgia, the family of a close friend, Alex, won the lottery for tickets to the Masters' practice rounds. Al and I decided to blow off classes that Wednesday and make the 100-mile drive from Athens down to Augusta for the Par-3 Contest.\n\nAs opposed to the serious business of vying for the Augusta National's coveted green jacket, the Par 3 tourney is a lark . The strict code of decorum by which fans must abide during the actual Masters is set aside for this nearly 60-year-old tradition.\n\nArnold Palmer, far left, was paired with golf greats Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player that day.\n\nGolfers interact with the fans and give high fives as they walk to the tee boxes. They sign hats and balls. Some bring their kids or grandkids as caddies. And cameras, which are strictly prohibited during the Masters, are more than welcome.\n\nSo, I bundled up the Canon SLR and lenses that my father had bought me when I decided to become a journalist and jumped in the car with Al.\n\nI'm a more passive golf fan than was my dad, so I was excited to see a then-27-year-old Tiger Woods. You may have heard of him. At the time, he was the No. 1 golfer in the world. Now? Not so much.\n\nParade of stars\n\nAl and I had primo seats right on the rope, so the golfers walked within feet of us as they made their way to the tee box on Hole 6. After I shot nearly a roll of film of Woods, I began taking photos for my dad.\n\nI got pictures of Colin Montgomerie, Jay Haas, Fred Couples, Tom Watson, K.J. Choi, Brad Faxon, Sergio Garcia, Mike Weir and a host of others. Pops especially loved the images of Zoeller, true to form, hamming it up with the crowd.\n\nFuzzy Zoeller goofs off with the crowd.\n\nThen came \"The King\" -- Palmer, in the flesh, paired with none other than Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, a triumvirate that owned Augusta in the 1960s and 1970s (they won a collective 13 green jackets between 1958 and 1986).\n\nThe spectators loved the grouping. Palmer, 73 at the time, approached the tee box, and the crowd erupted. \"Go get 'em, Arnie!\" fans yelled. Palmer beamed and shook hands with fans, accessible as ever.\n\nAs he addressed the ball, the crowd fell quiet. Palmer took his swing and you could tell from the grimace on his face that he didn't like the shot.\n\nPlunk! It landed right in the water, short of the green. The crowd let out a disappointed groan. Palmer shrugged and gave us a sheepish smirk.\n\nThe King's mulligan\n\nPerhaps emboldened by the loose etiquette at the Par 3 Contest -- or maybe it was the famously cheap beer Al and I had been quaffing while playing hooky that day -- I stood up out of my green folding chair and said, \"Mulligan!\"\n\nPalmer knew he didn't like his first shot, even before it hit the water.\n\n(For the uninitiated, a mulligan, for lack of a better description, is the act of ignoring a crappy shot and taking another stroke in its place without counting the crappy shot. It's basically cheating. As a guy who can't shoot nine holes without a mulligan or two, I can say it's a practice common among weekend hacks, not pro golfers of Palmer's caliber.)\n\nThe crowd exploded in agreement, and Palmer flashed that endearing smile. He looked around as if to ask no one in particular if it was OK, but no one was going to question \"The King.\"\n\nHe teed up again, took another swing and this one flew true, this time clearing the water, to the crowd's elation. Laughing, Palmer pumped his club in the air for the crowd and headed to the green with Nicklaus, Player and their caddies.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThat was my brush with \"The King.\" My dad was tickled when I told him the story, but he wasn't surprised. That's the kind of down-to-Earth guy Arnie was, he said -- again, as if he knew him.\n\nAnd from that day on, the tale of Arnie's mulligan at Augusta joined the arsenal of golf stories with which dad would regale his bar buddies at the American Legion. I'm proud to say, it even beat out Trevino's 1-iron.",

    "text": "(CNN) Airports need a lot of space, but in the places most in need of air connections -- islands and large metropolises -- it's a commodity that's in short supply.\n\nIn search of solutions, planners will sometimes turn to the sea.\n\nHuge land reclamation projects are an obvious route. That's what was done in Hong Kong and Osaka to expand airport capacity.\n\nSome visionaries have taken a rather different approach.\n\nWhat if we could make a runway float over the virtually limitless flat surface of the sea?\n\nFloating deck\n\nAircraft carriers have floating runways, but they're also warships which need to be maneuverable and to travel at speed.\n\nTheir decks are too small to deal with commercial craft -- even the largest carrier falls short of the requirements of modern jet airliners.\n\nBut let's take the concept of the floating deck further.\n\nWhat if we strip it of its engines and lower decks, anchor it in a set location, and then make it long enough and wide enough for a medium-sized airliner to land on it?\n\nThe result is a very large floating structure that's neither a ship nor an island: It's a floating airport.\n\nForerunners from history\n\nDuring World War II, the British entertained the idea of building runways on icebergs in order to provide cover for the vital Atlantic convoys.\n\nProject Habakkuk never materialized, but the floating airport concept lived on.\n\nIn 1995, 17 Japanese private firms, mostly shipbuilders and steelmakers, formed the Technological Research Association of Mega-Float with the support of the Japanese government.\n\nThe goal was to design and test a floating airport concept that, if successful, could be installed in Tokyo Bay -- and the Tokyo Mega-Float is possibly the most ambitious attempt of its kind to date.\n\nThe project called for a floating structure with a 4,000-meter-long runway, enough even for large airliners.\n\nA smaller-scale model with a 1,000-meter-long runway was actually built and tests proved that the Mega Float was suitable for aircraft operations.\n\nHowever, the project did not go ahead and the structure was later dismantled.\n\nSan Diego proposal\n\nSimilar proposals have been floated, quite literally in this case, for San Diego, a city whose international airport has little room left to expand in its current location.\n\nProposals to build a brand new two-runway international airport in the sea, a few miles off Point Loma have been put forward by two different companies, OceanWorks Development and Float Inc\n\nWhether it was the $20 billion price tag that proved a bit too expensive, or lingering doubts about the technical feasibility of the concept, the fact is neither project has materialized.\n\nFloating aerotropolis\n\nAn artist's rendering of Terry Drinkard's floating airport concept.\n\nThe San Diego projects have some similarities with the floating airport concept devised by Terry Drinkard, an American aeronautical engineer who has conducted extensive research in this field.\n\nHis scheme draws heavily from technologies and materials that have already been tested in the construction of deepwater oil rigs.\n\nDrinkard's vision is for a full-fledged offshore \"aerotropolis:\" a floating structure that, as well as being able to handle medium-sized airliners (of the Boeing 737 or A320 types), would also host a whole range of economic and research activities, from experimentation with renewable energy technology to aquaculture and yachting.\n\nThis floating airport would be energy self-sufficient.\n\nPower would be harvested from the waves, from the sun and through ocean thermal energy conversion, a technology that produces electricity by utilizing the temperature differences between depths of seawater.\n\nIts structure would provide a base for oceanographic research and aquaculture and it would also double as a port and recreational marina, while its potential offshore status could attract a host of other economic activities.\n\nBridging the Atlantic\n\nA more daring version of the concept revives the idea, already put forward by a 1930 article in the magazine Popular Mechanics , of bridging the Atlantic with a chain of such floating airports.\n\nThis would enable all sorts of aircraft, including smaller airliners and private jets, to cross the ocean without the need to secure costly ETOPS (extended-range twin-engine operational standards) certification or take the more indirect northern route through Iceland and Newfoundland.\n\nBut the most realistic chances for a floating airport might be found in warmer waters.\n\nCommander Bud Slabbaert, aviation consultant and Drinkard's partner in this project, says a small-scale version of the floating airport is currently being evaluated by several governments and infrastructure operators in the Caribbean.\n\nIt's a region heavily dependent on air transport where the lack of space is compounded by some of the islands' hilly or mountainous terrain.\n\nOther aviation experts remain a lot more skeptical when consulted about the feasibility of the concept.\n\nR. W. Mann, a consultant and former airline planning executive with several U.S. network airlines, thinks such an project is highly unlikely to get off the ground due to the relatively high cost and limited practical gain.\n\n\"Projects that involve building runways on the sea, such as those currently underway in the South China Sea , are driven primarily by non-economic considerations,\" he says.\n\nBoris Island\n\nIt's true that airports are a massive investment -- even more so if they have to be built over water.\n\nSo it's no surprise that, despite the concept of a floating airport having being around for a long time, it's failed to come to fruition yet.\n\nDespite decades of increasing air traffic and sprawling urban development across the world, airport relocation is still a rarity -- Hong Kong did it in 1998 and Munich did it in 1992.\n\nIn London, the controversy about the future of Heathrow airport, one of the most congested major air hubs anywhere in the world, has been raging on for years.\n\nSome of the most remarkable proposals to sort out London's air capacity problem involve relocation to the Thames Estuary, where the River Thames meets the North Sea.\n\nRenowned architect Norman Foster came up with the concept of a four-runway airport to be built from scratch on the Isle of Grain, a marshy area some 30 miles east of central London.\n\nThe project was popularly known as \"Boris Island\", because former London mayor Boris Johnson was one of its most solid backers, but it was rejected by the UK Airports Commission in 2014.\n\nSix runways for $63 billion\n\nGensler's proposal for southeast England's airport expansion.\n\nA rather more ambitious proposal was put forward by the architecture firm Gensler and Thames Estuary Research and Development (Testrad), calling for the airport to be built right in the middle of the estuary.\n\nIn this vision, a six-runway airport would be built over the waters of the Thames Estuary at a cost of nearly $63 billion.\n\nThe runways would stretch parallel to each other on both sides of a central core, where the main terminal would be located.\n\nThe airport would be connected to land through underwater tunnels for high-speed rail connections.\n\nGensler considered two options, explains Ian Mulcahey, the firm's managing director.\n\nThe first was a floating structure along the lines of the Tokyo Mega-Float, but the water in that area proved too shallow.\n\nSo it opted for a \"polder\"-like concept, where dykes would be used to delimit the area of the airport and water would then be drained to create a dry, flat surface.\n\n\"Although it might sound challenging when compared to building on dry land, by building the airport in a body of water we can get away with the lengthy and costly process of gathering the huge expanse of land you need for a project of this size\", says Mulcahey.\n\nHe insists the final decision about London airport expansion has not yet been taken.\n\nOn June 30, the UK's Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced that following the UK voting to leave the European Union, such decision-making has been delayed until \"at least October.\"\n\nSo while an extra runway at Heathrow and Gatwick is by far the most popular solution being debated , don't write off the Thames estuary gateway just yet.\n\nA question of economics\n\nWhat decades of studies about the feasibility of the floating airport concept has shown is that its ultimate development and application is not a matter of technology, but of getting the economics right.\n\nThe oil industry has demonstrated that when there is a pressing need -- and money to be made -- virtually any obstacle can be pushed aside.\n\nThe vast number of oil platforms defying the elements in some of the world's harshest environments are witness to it.\n\nThe same could one day be true of the floating airport.",

You can shape his coverage.\n\nSix degrees Celsius of warming may not sound like much -- probably because \"temperatures can swing by 6 degrees within an hour if a warm front passes, and it doesn't mean the end of the world,\" said Mark Lynas, author of a book called \"Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet.\"\n\nBut if we raise global average surface temperatures by just 6 degrees above pre-industrial levels, Lynas told me, we'll create \"a scenario which is so extreme it's almost unimaginable.\"\n\n\"Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable,\" he said. \"Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and sub-polar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. It's difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. There's a certain level above which plants just can't survive.\n\n\"There's a certain level where humans biologically can't survive outside as well ... The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen-deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well -- which would then release gases and affect land. So it's pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts.\"\n\nI chatted with Lynas, a science writer in the UK, about how to avoid a 6-degree world, the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees -- and how to talk to kids about climate change.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nMark Lynas\n\nSutter: I've gotten a lot of questions from readers about what 2 degrees of warming means. What does it mean for sea levels? What does it mean for hurricanes? Extinctions? Those sorts of things. Could I run through a couple of those and get your take on it, as someone who's read through just mountains of this research?\n\nLynas: Sure, sure. I'll do my best.\n\nSutter: OK. Could we start with extinctions? What will we see around the 2-degree mark?\n\nIn the marine environment, I think the most threatened ecosystems are coral reefs. (They're) threatened both by coral bleaching, due to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, plus the general degradation of everyday, general human activity. It's very tough to imagine that the world's coral reefs will continue to exist in their present day form in a 2-degree warmer world.\n\nThe other most-threatened environments probably are the mountain ecosystems -- where species will be left marooned in shrinking islands of habitat. As temperature rises, you can imagine biomes rising up the sides of the mountains, and species which are dependent on a certain level of temperature and humidity will get left with nowhere to go.\n\nSutter: What about hurricanes and severe weather?\n\nThere's really a lot of uncertainty about this. It's possible to imagine hurricanes will become less frequent but more intense, and possibly (form) over new areas.\n\nSutter: What about droughts? I get a lot of California questions.\n\nLynas: The overall global picture is kind of, 'unto them that have with be given more and unto them have not shall be taken away' -- if you want to get biblical. That maps out as the subtropics, which are already the drier parts of the globe, will become more water-deficient. The deep tropics will actually get more rainfall, as well as some of the mid-latitudes. But the subtropics -- which is the southwest of the U.S. -- would expect to see less rainfall, which indeed seems to be what's happening. That does call into question, really, the development model that large areas of the southwestern U.S. have adopted -- expecting a large amount of freshwater to be available to urban areas and agriculture, which are already in a pretty arid location.\n\nSo I do think it's going to be hard to adapt to that change.\n\nSutter: I've also gotten questions about the low-lying Pacific Island nations. At 2 degrees, what is their fate?\n\nLynas: I used to be adviser to president of the Maldives, who is, by the way, now in jail due to there having been a coup. But his challenge, and his main agenda, when he was president, was to bring to attention the fate of the small island states -- especially those that are coral atolls. For the Maldives, the entire country exists at a meter or less above sea level, and little more. It's difficult to imagine the survival of coral atoll nations at 2 degrees, it has to be said. Although the extinction process depends on the rate of sea level rise. It might take decades, it might take centuries, it's not clear at the moment. But I don't think they have a very long term future.\n\nSutter: Moving up the degree ladder, you describe a 6-degree world as a \"sixth circle of hell.\" What do you mean by that -- and can you describe some of what we know about that world?\n\nLynas: It's a scenario which is so extreme it's almost unimaginable. Not many studies have addressed this because it's so far off the scale of what can be envisaged. I found myself looking back at the really serious traumatic events in the Earth's geological history, which have led to mass extinctions, such as the one at the end of the Permian period, 250 million years ago, which wiped out nearly 90% of life on Earth. Actually, a lot of the mass extinctions seem to have been associated with very rapid global warming events. Humans are releasing carbon more rapidly even than took place during mass extinctions. We haven't gotten there in terms of the overall amount, but we're certainly moving in that direction. So it's not a planet that I think any of us would want to live in, and it doesn't have to happen. While I think it's important to try to visualize what a 6-degree world would look like, it's also important to remember that we don't have to go there.\n\nSutter: What else do we know about a 6-degree world?\n\nLynas: Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable. Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and subpolar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. It's difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. There's a certain level above which plants just can't survive. There's a certain level where humans biologically can't survive outside, as well. We get close enough already in the Arabian Peninsula and some other parts of the world. Remember, 6 degrees is a global average. It would be probably twice that over land and somewhat less than that over the oceans. The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well -- which would then release gases and affect land. So it's pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts.\n\nSutter: I'm wondering why you took this approach -- looking at climate change by degrees?\n\nLynas: A lot of people want to know what warming we get with what emissions path, or what warming we might get by what date. That's pretty fundamentally uncertain because they depend on different factors which aren't very well quantified. I felt that looking at it degree by degree was much more robust. If the temperature rises by X amount then what will be Y impacts? There are three major sources of information about that. One is the observational changes we're already seeing in terms of impacts in temperature rise. The second is computer models showing different ecosystem changes or whatever. And the third is paleoclimate sources -- so looking at how the climate was different in earlier hotter periods in geologic time. So piecing those together and mapping them onto a degree by degree picture seemed to me to be a way to try to convey this in a visual and intuitive -- but also highly scientifically appropriate -- way.\n\nSutter: What do you think about the world's focus on the 2-degree mark? One activist said to me that 2 degrees is the only thing the international community agrees upon for climate change.\n\nLynas: I think it's important to have a target -- because it focuses policy and it focuses people's efforts. And it makes sense also to have a target based on the temperature. But it's not something we can meet, by definition. We don't have a simple thermostat where we can decide exactly how much carbon to emit and have an exact temperature result dependent on that. So, there's uncertainty, really, about what level of emissions will lead to what temperature outcomes, by when. However, I think that 2 degrees is really the absolute upper limit of what's tolerable in terms of ecosystems and, probably, adaptive capacities of human societies. A 2-degree world is a world without coral reefs, and with much less snow and ice and with fairly dramatic heatwaves -- and other impacts. So, I would like to see a global warming future in which warming actually is lower than that, personally.\n\nSutter: Do you think that's possible?\n\nLynas: I think it's possible. It's not very likely. If our current understanding of climate sensitivity is broadly correct then we're probably going to come in between 2 and 3 degrees, somewhere, by the end of the century. I guess the good news is the absolutely calamitous 5 and 6 degree outcomes are particularly unlikely, too, although still possible. And certainly, the risk of them happening is higher than the risk of an airplane crashing when we get onto it.\n\nSutter: Wait, so you're saying the risk of 5 or 6 degrees of warming -- a doomsday scenario -- is higher than an airplane crashing?\n\nLynas: Well, the likelihood of an airplane crashing is, I don't know, one in 1 million -- or something on that order of magnitude. Whereas the likelihood of coming within 5 or 6 degrees of warming is probably more than 1 in 100. It's the sort of risk that one would not tolerate at a personal level. But, perhaps because we can diffuse responsibility, we feel that it's tolerable for our species to take that gamble with the whole planet. Maybe it's because we just think there's nothing we can do about it. And we have an in-built optimism bias, myself included, where we like to think that things will just turn out all right, because they often tend to. And meantime we'll go on with our lives as normal. It's a big ask, I guess, to make society as a whole forgo the main energy source we all enjoy, which is fossil fuels, in order to forestall uncertain impacts decades into the future.\n\nSutter: One of the things that struck me from your book is that you were surprised people are depressed by climate change. Isn't this a pretty depressing subject?\n\nIt doesn't really matter whether you find it depressing or not, it's the scientific reality. We have to deal with it. A thing like climate change is known as a 'wicked problem.' It's seen differently by different people, according to their psychological, political and cultural biases. You can frame it as just a technology challenge: Let's get off of fossil fuels and let's get onto renewables and nuclear -- easy. Or you can frame it as a moral challenge: We're trespassing on the rights of future generations and how dare we do that. Or you can see it as a political challenge -- that somehow these big fossil fuel corporations are transgressing democracy and forcing us to stay hooked on oil and coal and gas. Different people, according to their politics, will see climate change fundamentally in this way. It's not a simple problem to understand.\n\nSutter: So how do you look at it? Do you ever find climate change overwhelming or depressing, personally?\n\nWell, I'm a pragmatist. I think it's a solvable problem. I don't think we need to abandon capitalism or change our entire political system in order to tackle this challenge. Other people do, and I disagree with them on that. And we have debates late into the night. But I think with next-generation nuclear technologies, and particularly with the way solar power is developing so rapidly, and how rapidly it's coming down in cost, and how quickly the technology is improving, there are zero-carbon options now becoming much more widely available, which will bring down our emissions much more rapidly than people think -- or than people thought just a few years ago. I don't think there's any point being pessimistic about that. Pessimistic people don't achieve anything. It's important to do what's possible -- and to do it quickly.\n\nSutter: What do you make of the way the world's responding?\n\nLynas: We are now inhabiting a human-dominated planet. We are in a new epoch known as the Anthropocene. The Holocene is now considered to be over. And I don't think there's really been another species that has had that effect on the planet before -- maybe the first bacteria that emitted oxygen, or photosynthesizing microorganisms. But we really are into terra incognita looking forward. That gives our species a serious level of responsibility for planetary management that people just don't really appreciate at any kind of fundamental physiological or political level. We are in charge. It's up to us. We actually do have an overall effect on the earth's temp. It's not up to Mother Nature anymore to run the show.\n\nSutter: Do you have children?\n\nLynas: Yeah. The reason I was distracted just a minute ago was my kids just came back from school.\n\nSutter: Do you talk to them about this? What do you say?\n\nLynas: I talk to them a bit. They know what I do. Younger generations have grown up with this specter. It's a bit like how those of us who are older grew up with the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation ... So they're not entirely in a different situation, I suppose, from previous generations. You could feel bad for future generations, but on the other hand I'm not sure their future is any worse than the future for somebody born in, say, 1900, who in all likelihood, in Europe, would have killed in one of the world wars. It's a manageable problem. We're beginning to get the grips of it. There are some positive signs already -- China and the U.S. agreeing to peak emissions, and things like that. So it's not a counsel of despair. And I think it's important to talk to kids at that level -- not to make them think that somehow they're fundamentally doomed.\n\nThat isn't the case and doesn't have to be the case.\n\nSutter: What needs to happen to ensure things do improve? What are the benchmarks you're looking to to say, 'OK, we're managing this problem. We're doing what's needed'?\n\nLynas: Well, I'm a Well, I'm a ecomodernist , which is a new label a lot of environmental thinkers are beginning to attach to themselves -- because it's a bit different from more traditional environmentalism, which thought we were somehow doomed or we were fundamentally a destructive species. We can turn this around -- this and other problems as well, if we have a more pragmatic approach to politics, economist -- and especially technology. We need to have a price on carbon, so that emitting carbon dioxide isn't cheaper than other energy sources. We need to invest heavily in research and development in zero-carbon sources, including next-generation nuclear renewable energies, especially solar. And we need to deploy them on an ever wider scale, with increased financing. We also need to have a political agreement -- so there's a sense the whole world is moving in the right direction. All of those things are not just possible, but I think they're fundamentally achievable, and likely. But we need to keep the pressure up on politicians and on everyone else.\n\nEmail questions to: climate [at] cnn.com.\n\nFollow the project on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. This column is adapted from a larger CNN story, \" The poor kids of Silicon Valley .\"\n\n(CNN) California's Silicon Valley is one of the most prosperous places in the United States -- home to tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple.\n\nYet even this region isn't immune from the scourge of child poverty.\n\nI visited Silicon Valley in November for CNN's Change the List series . Readers of this website voted for me to do a story on child poverty. There, I found children living in tents, homeless shelters -- even a garage, which I found particularly ironic given that Google and Apple link their company origins to garages in this valley south of San Francisco.\n\nInstead of going on about all that's wrong with Silicon Valley and this country as a whole, where one in five kids lives below the poverty line, I want to bring some good news: We can fix this.\n\nChild poverty isn't inevitable.\n\nIt's a choice.\n\nAnd we can choose to end it.\n\nHere are four ways we can start to do that. If you don't like these, go to this Google Form (yeah, Google) and suggest a solution of your own. Your ideas may end up in a future column.\n\n(Side note: Google declined to comment on \" The poor kids of Silicon Valley. \" Facebook and Apple, meanwhile, did not respond to my repeated email requests for comment.)\n\n1. Boost housing subsidies\n\nThe idea: Housing is too expensive for poor families, especially in markets such as Silicon Valley. But making affordable housing more available can reduce this burden.\n\nEvidence it works: Increasing federal housing subsidies would reduce U.S. child poverty by 20.8%, according to a 2015 Children's Defense Fund report. That would lift 2.3 million kids out of poverty. The annual cost would be $23.5 billion.\n\nFor more info, read this report: \" , read this report: \" Ending Child Poverty Now .\"\n\nWhat you can do: Support vetted California organizations that provide free or subsidized housing to low-income families, including Support vetted California organizations that provide free or subsidized housing to low-income families, including Family Supportive Housing and Samaritan House . Or: Petition Facebook, Apple or Google to fund subsidized housing projects in their own backyard.\n\n2. Raise the minimum wage\n\nThe idea: Working families can't afford to raise their kids, and better wages would help them do it. The federal minimum wage is worth considerably less now than it was in the 1960s, adjusted for inflation, according to the Congressional Research Service. The federal minimum wage was worth $9.27 in 1963, using July 2013 dollars. Now it's $7.25.\n\nEvidence it works: Raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, and boosting the tipped worker wage to $7.07, could reduce U.S. child poverty by 4%, according to the Children's Defense Fund report. That would help lift 400,000 American kids out of poverty. To see how something like that plays out, I visited the Idaho-Washington border.\n\nIdaho's minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Washington's is $9.47. The difference is $4,618 per year. On my visit, I met Amanda Palmen, a 27-year-old gas station worker. She told me that that wage difference is enough to help her two girls more comfortably -- and get off the SNAP program.\n\nJUST WATCHED Opinion: Why the minimum wage matters to kids Replay More Videos ...

Invest in preschool and child care\n\nThe idea: Kids who attend high-quality preschools are more likely to graduate from high school and tend to earn more as adults. Every child should have that chance. Additionally, expanding child care subsidies could help. Spending $5.3 billion would reduce U.S. child poverty by 3%, or 300,000 kids, according to the Children's Defense Fund report.\n\nEvidence it works: Meet the poorest kids in Iceland, a country with a low child poverty rate and nearly universal enrollment in early education, starting at age 2. In America, meanwhile, despite advances in many states, only 40% of 3-year-olds are enrolled. (Rates do go up for 4- and 5-year-olds, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.)\n\nJUST WATCHED Opinion: What the United States can learn from Iceland Replay More Videos ...

Give poor families cash\n\nThe idea: The thing poor families lack is money. Give it to them and let them decide how to spend it.\n\nEvidence it works: Cherokee, North Carolina, pays tribal members a biannual stipend, just for being alive. And social ills have declined. The money comes from a casino, which the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation owns. In 1996, the tribal council voted to distribute 50% of the casino profits evenly among its 15,000 members, according to Vice Chief Larry Blythe.\n\nA Duke University researcher has been studying the impact of these payments for two decades. She follows 1,420 kids, comparing the lives of those who get the casino money with those who don't. The results are startling. For the poorest families, a yearly $4,000 payment reduced by 22% the odds that children would commit minor crimes by their late teens. The poorest kids were one grade year ahead when researchers checked in with them at 21. Mental health also improved. Kids who were lifted out of poverty by the payments saw behavioral problems decrease by 40%.\n\nFor more info, read this op-ed: \" , read this op-ed: \" The argument for the basic income .\"\n\nWhat you can do: Start a petition asking Congress to sponsor a \"basic income\" bill.\n\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.",

    "text": "The future of a dying language depended on translating the word \"poke.\"\n\nFor three weeks, about half a dozen defenders of the Corsican language worked together to translate some of the most common English terms used on Facebook: \"friend,\" \"like,\" \"invite\" and, of course, \"poke.\"\n\nThe word they settled on for poke, \"stuzzic\u00e0,\" roughly means to alert or tease someone. It's like saying \"yoo-hoo or cuckoo,\" according to Vannina Bernard-Leoni, who helped spearhead the translation effort.\n\n\"It was good to try to find not only a literal translation, but really a very vernacular translation, very close to popular expression in Corsican,\" she said. \"It was beautiful work.\"\n\nThe unusual linguistic exercise was the first step in a two-year campaign that involved an estimated 2,000 participants collaborating to translate everyday words, symbols and Facebook phrases into Corsican.\n\nThe goal was to convince Facebook (FB, Tech30) to recognize Corsican as an option for users, thereby giving the endangered language a home on the world's largest social network -- and perhaps a firmer place in the 21st century.\n\nOn Thursday, Facebook announced that it is now available in Corsican and two other additional languages, bringing its total number of language options to 101.\n\nRelated: Facebook goes on apology tour following video metric mess up\n\nThere are more than 6,000 languages in the world, half of which are expected to disappear by the end of this century, according to UNESCO.\n\nCorsican, a romance language similar to Italian, has been classified as \"definitely endangered\" by UNESCO, which means \"children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home.\"\n\nTo date, Facebook has added translation options for nine of these endangered languages, including Basque, Welsh and Tamazight. Another nine endangered languages, including Cherokee and Yiddish, are in the process of being translated.\n\nThe translations are largely put together by crowdsourcing from local communities through a Facebook translate app. But Facebook does have to dedicate engineers to work with the communities and write code to support variations of each language.\n\n\"This isn't a ROI type part of the business,\" says Iris Orriss, director of internationalization and localization at Facebook, using the acronym for return on investment. \"The mission for Facebook is to enable people to share and make the world more open and connected. Language is such a vital part of connectivity.\"\n\nOrriss says Facebook may be able to help endangered languages stay relevant for the next generation.\n\n\"Often ... the younger generation speaks the language, but doesn't care about it as much because the broad language of communication is often another one like English,\" Orriss says. By bringing it to Facebook, it shows the language \"can be fun and can be exciting,\" she adds. \"It's not just old books.\"\n\nBernard-Leoni, 35, first became interested in bringing Corsican to Facebook in late 2014 after she heard the social network had recognized Breton, another endangered language.\n\nShe was born in Corsica, a small French island in the Mediterranean, but left at the age of 18 to study abroad and travel. She returned a decade later for a position at the University of Corsica -- with renewed conviction for the future of her culture.\n\n\"I'm convinced that in Corsica we can be very attached to our past, our values, our culture and our language and at the same time be absolutely open to the world,\" she says. \"I think this Facebook translation is a perfect illustration of this vision.\"\n\nBernard-Leoni helped organize a small team, coordinating mostly through a Facebook Groups page, to translate an initial batch of keywords to submit to Facebook. The company then gave the green light for a broader crowdsourced effort.\n\nThe hope from Thursday's launch, she adds, is that \"all Corsican people understand that there is a language for everybody.\"\n\nFacebook isn't the first tech company to offer support to endangered languages. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) and Google (GOOGL, Tech30) have launched projects to research, record and translate regional dialects -- with mixed success.\n\n\"It looks impressive to an outsider, but if you sit down with a native speaker they will tell you the translation quality is laughable,\" says K. David Harrison, a linguistics professor at Swarthmore College who has worked with businesses like Microsoft on these efforts.\n\nSome communities are embarrassed by the translations online, while others see it as a positive for the language, flawed as it may be, according to Harrison.\n\n\"Just seeing your language on a drop-down menu on Facebook is encouraging,\" he says. \"They want to cross the digital divide with their language and they don't want to have to leave it behind.\"",

    "text": "CNN.com is showcasing the work of Mosaic, a new digital publication that explores the science of life. It's produced by the Wellcome Trust , a global charitable foundation that supports research in biology, medicine and the medical humanities, with the goal of improving human and animal health. The content is produced solely by Mosaic, and we will be posting some of its most thought-provoking work.\n\n(CNN) There was a certain kind of quiet hopefulness when, in late April this year, the last Ebola patient of the West African epidemic -- a two-year-old boy -- walked out of a treatment facility in Monrovia, Liberia. With the smoldering embers of the outbreak fading, there was cause for celebration. But there remains the impotent fear of the unseen: Ebola is still out there, lurking. We just don't know where it's hiding or when it will be back.\n\nAnd if we're going to stop Ebola in the future, we have to find its hiding places.\n\nEbola is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it can spread between animals and humans. It burns hot and fast through people. Its ruthless nature means that we are often the end of the line for the virus: a host like us that gets too sick too fast, that dies too quickly, cuts down the virus's ability to jump into a fresh body. To remain a threat, Ebola needs a safe house in which to lie low and hide.\n\nSuch a long-term host, the quiet refuge of a pathogen, is known as a reservoir species. If a reservoir species is Ebola's safe house, we are its luxury retirement property, a place for it to live out its last days with a bang. The trouble is that we aren't sure where the safe house is. If we are going to be vigilant against Ebola's re-emergence, we need to find it.\n\nBats -- Ebola's hideout?\n\nSearches so far have focused on forested parts of Africa, the home of a number of possible reservoirs. Classically, bats have been considered the most likely culprits, given that they overlap with humans geographically and can carry Ebola infection without symptoms. Based on research that has tested a wide variety of small mammals, bats, primates, insects and amphibians, several species of fruit bat have emerged as possible candidates.\n\nA 2005 study published in Nature and helmed by Eric Leroy tested over 1,000 small vertebrates in central Africa and found evidence of symptomless Ebola infection in three species of fruit bat, suggesting that these animals -- which are sometimes hunted for bushmeat -- might be Ebola's reservoir. An editor's summary ran alongside the paper, titled simply: \" Ebola virus: don't eat the bats .\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Virus hunters look for deadly diseases in bat caves Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Virus hunters look for deadly diseases in bat caves 08:54\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that fruit bats are to blame. Some researchers, like Fabian Leendertz of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, are working with circumstantial evidence that points to the insectivorous bat Mops condylurus. The first -- or \"index\" -- case of the 2014 Ebola epidemic was traced to a two-year-old boy in Guinea who may have spent time inside a large hollow cola tree near his house before falling ill. T\n\nhe tree was a known roost for these bats and a popular neighborhood play spot. The boy died in December 2013, and by the following March, officials were alerting the public to the brewing outbreak. However, by the time researchers arrived in April to examine the tree and its inhabitants, it had been burned down.\n\nStill others are looking elsewhere for Ebola's home, skeptical that bats are to blame. Virologist Jens Kuhn of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland, has told Nature that he thinks bats live much too close to humans: if they were the reservoir, it would be curious that there have been so few emergences of Ebola since we first discovered the virus 40 years ago. Instead, he believes insects or fungi could be possibilities.\n\nAs Kuhn told National Geographic in 2015, he's betting on finding Ebola in a \"strange host\", explaining that perhaps the virus is hiding in a tick or a flea that intermittently bites bats, which only sometimes initiates the virus's move from the wild into human communities.\n\nFinding Ebola in strange places\n\nNevertheless, bats are largely considered to be our best bet, even if a lot of the incriminating evidence is circumstantial. The fact that certain bat species can harbor an Ebola infection is important.\n\nA screening test in 1996, during which researchers injected live Ebola virus into 24 species of plant and 19 species of animal -- such as pigeons, cockroaches, small mammals and lizards -- found that bats could test positive for Ebola infection for at least 12 days. None of the bats died from the virus, and none of the other species showed such potential as hosts.\n\nJUST WATCHED Investigating the world's deadliest diseases Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Investigating the world's deadliest diseases 06:46\n\nThis capacity to handle the virus adds to the argument that bats could be Ebola's hideout. But without further evidence, we can't be sure that they are.\n\nThe reason we need to be sure has to do with prediction and prevention: if we know the reservoir species and where they live, we can allocate resources to areas at risk, help the local communities better prepare, and cut down on potential exposure to the virus by educating those who might stumble through its territory.\n\nAnd that's where zoonotic niche mapping comes in.\n\nMapping the virus\n\nThese maps are a way to look for patterns in where Ebola comes out of the forest and into the homes that line the wilderness -- scenarios known as \"spillover\" events. By studying Ebola spillover, we can better predict where the virus might emerge in the future. Researchers like spatial epidemiologist David Pigott are combining measures of ecological features like vegetation, elevation and the presence of suspected reservoir species with the exact geospatial coordinates of index cases to create an algorithm that describes who might be at risk.\n\n\"We wanted to know where else in Africa could potentially be in the same situation as Guinea in 2013 and early 2014,\" says Pigott, lead author of the newly updated zoonotic niche map of Ebola in Africa . Back then, doctors were seeing cases of Ebola virus disease but not diagnosing them correctly, \"because no one thought that Ebola could be circulating in that area.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Meet one of the first Zika vaccine volunteers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Meet one of the first Zika vaccine volunteers 01:19\n\nCuriously, in Pigott's model, the presence of bats is not the strongest clue precipitating a spillover event. Instead, he says, the main predictor of where Ebola may emerge is the vegetation index. The amount of vegetation \"could influence a variety of different species,\" he explains. Though bats were included in the model, \"it was vegetation that dominated the profile.\" Translation: among areas that had experienced a spillover event, there was a critical pattern of plant cover that stands to be very helpful in identifying areas that might be at risk from Ebola in the future.\n\nTransmission routes\n\nWhile ecological niche mapping can help in predicting spillover, there's also another, less well explored hiding place to consider: people. Ebola has an incredible ability, unknown until recently, to stake out a claim in bodily fluids of men who have survived infection, long after they have returned to health.\n\nIn fact, a recent study found that over half of male survivors tested positive for Ebola in their semen one year or longer after they'd recovered, with one survivor's semen testing positive a full 565 days post-recovery. Because of the risk of spreading infection, male survivors are recommended to avoid unprotected sex until their semen has twice tested negative for Ebola.\n\nDespite this, Pigott thinks it's worth bearing in mind that most outbreaks historically have followed a narrative of human-animal interaction. \"The other big unknown in terms of future outbreaks is how long is the transmission route viable.\" It's hard to incorporate transmission by survivors into a predictive model because we simply don't know how long people can carry the virus and remain infectious.\n\nThis potential for human-to-human transmission means that Ebola has opportunities to re-emerge without a spillover event from the forest. And this means you don't even need to be near the forest to get it. Ebola's persistence in semen means we now have to track this curious villain in two ways. We must look for both patterns of emergence in our messy data streams.\n\nSo to be prepared for Ebola in the future, we need to discover how the virus moves through the wild and the city alike. We must find out where it thrives and how it spills over, and we must track it to all of the places it goes when we are not watching from the hospital bedside. With Ebola, there remain too many questions for us to rest easy.",

    "text": "David A. Love writes for thegrio.com . He is a writer and human rights activist based in Philadelphia. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) On Tuesday, a white police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed black man in the back. Officer Michael Slager was arrested after raw video surfaced showing him firing numerous shots at Walter Scott as Scott ran away from a traffic stop.\n\nThe video footage contradicts Slager's statement that he felt threatened after Scott allegedly took his stun gun during a scuffle. The Post and Courier reported that the FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death along with the State Law Enforcement Division, while the South Carolina attorney general is investigating possible civil rights violations.\n\nNow, after watching the footage \u2014 which should remain in your memory for a long time to come \u2014 one could say that Slager shot Scott like a dog. But then again, dogs usually are not treated this badly. But the man was shot like a runaway slave.\n\nIn this case, there was clear documented evidence of what occurred, and no room for fabrications. Most police fatal shootings do not result in indictments because prosecutors conclude they are justifiable. The police officer can always plant a gun on the suspect he shot to death, or like Slager, apparently place a Taser near Scott's body and concoct some story that his life was in danger.\n\n\"We can't bring Mr. Scott back, but something like this today can have a bigger precedence than just what happened here with Mr. Scott. Because what happened today doesn't happen all the time,\" said L. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, at a press conference.\n\n\"I don't think that all police officers are bad cops, but there are some bad ones out there. And I don't want to see anyone get shot down the way that my brother got shot down,\" said Anthony Scott, brother of the victim.\n\n\"What if there was no video? What if there was no witness, or hero as I call him, to come forward? Then this wouldn't have happened, because as you can see, the initial reports stated something totally different. The officer said that Mr. Scott attacked him and pulled his Taser and tried to use it on him. But somebody was watching,\" Stewart added.\n\n\"After watching the video, the senseless shooting and taking of #WalterScott's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable,\" tweeted Sen. Tim Scott. \"My heart aches for the family and our North Charleston community. I will be watching this case closely.\"\n\nAlthough the black community and others have been aware for years of the problem of police brutality, through personal experience and anecdotes, the data confirm that police use of deadly force is a black and white issue. A ProPublica analysis of police shootings from 2010 to 2012 found that young black males are 21 times more likely to be fatally shot by the police than young white males. And 67% of teens killed while fleeing or resisting arrest were black.\n\nOf the whites who are killed by cops, 91% are killed by white cops. Sixty-eight percent of people of color who are killed by police are also killed by white officers. Furthermore, 10% of police involved in fatal shootings are black, and 78% of the people killed by black officers are black.\n\nAccording to Cynthia Lee of George Washington University Law School, the disproportionate representation of blacks and other people of color in police shootings is due to the role of racial stereotypes by police . Racial stereotypes, Lee argues, subconsciously influence an officer's decision on whether to use deadly force, even if the police do not consciously decide to use deadly force based on race. A simple question posed to the officer by a black person could be perceived as a threat to the officer's authority.\n\nWhat's more, a Washington State University study on deadly force found that participants felt more threatened in scenarios involving black suspects, suggesting participants \"held subconscious biases associating blacks and threats.\"\n\nScott is the latest in a long line of black bodies, from Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, to John Crawford III near Dayton, Ohio, and Tanisha Anderson and Tamir Rice in Cleveland.\n\nIn this case, the bystander video of Scott's killing and the cover-up of the crime by Slager made the difference. Otherwise, the bogus narrative of the good white cop protecting himself from the menacing black thug may have prevailed.\n\nWhat happened in North Charleston tells us the epidemic of police deadly force has not died. And yet, the mobilization and heightened consciousness of people across the nation have kept the issue on the front burner. The taking of black lives by the police remains a crisis situation in America that must be addressed, because #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nMay Walter Scott rest in peace. The arrest and charging of Officer Michael Slager is a rare event that must be celebrated for the small victory that it is, in the midst of unspeakable tragedy. But this is by no means over.",

    "text": "It's a big day for Google.\n\nLooking to drum up consumer excitement, the tech company hosted an event in San Francisco on Tuesday to unveil a series of products, including two new phones, a virtual reality headset and the Chromecast Ultra.\n\nThe flagship announcement was the introduction of Pixel, the first Google phone to carry exclusively Google branding. The company called it the \"first phone made by Google inside and out.\"\n\nThe device is poised to take on the iPhone with a built-in artificially intelligent assistant, 4K video and other bells and whistles.\n\nHere's a closer look at everything you need to know:\n\nPixel smartphones\n\nGoogle (GOOG) announced a new Pixel line of phones -- the 5-inch Pixel ($649) and 5.5-inch Pixel XL ($769). The prices are the same as the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus.\n\nThe devices boast 4GB of RAM, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, a fingerprint sensor and a 12MP rear-facing camera.\n\nThe phones drop its existing Nexus branding in favor of \"Pixel,\" a nod to Google's existing tablet and Chromebook line. Both run on Android 7.1 Nougat, Google's most recent mobile operating system.\n\nThe devices come with a built-in AI assistant, Google Assistant. The company demonstrated how the AI software can make a reservation for you right from the device and complete other tasks.\n\nPixel has a pretty sweet perk for photo fans, too: Users will get free unlimited storage of photos and videos -- something Apple would be wise to consider in the future.\n\nThe devices, which are available for pre-sale starting on Tuesday, come in three colors: quite black, very silver and really blue.\n\nChromecast Ultra\n\nGoogle unveiled its next-generation content streaming device, the Chromecast Ultra. The gadget, which has sold 30 million units to date, supports 4K streaming. Chromecast Ultra will be available for $69 this fall.\n\nGoogle's popular Chromecast device plugs into your TV through an HDMI port and can stream content from your computer or mobile device.\n\nDaydream\n\nGoogle also showed off its new virtual reality headset for mobile devices, Daydream View. The viewer holds a smartphone, while the user has a hand-held remote to control what's happening on screen.\n\nThe Pixel phones are the first Daydream-ready devices. But there are a lot more on the way from partners, according to Google's Clay Bavor.\n\nIt will be available in slate, snow and crimson colors, and cost $79 when it launches in November.\n\nDaydream is launching with over 50 partners and a slew of games. The company is also working with Warner Brothers to bring immersive environments to the device, and the headset will support Netflix, HBO and Hulu.\n\nGoogle isn't necessarily trying to compete with Oculus' VR hardware ($599) or the HTC Vive ($799). Both of those systems, favored by gamers and early VR adopters, are for immersive VR experiences and require PCs.\n\nInstead, the company will target casual VR consumers who have -- or will buy -- Android smartphones running Nougat. Its closest competitor could be the Samsung Gear VR headset ($99), built for Samsung Galaxy devices and powered by Oculus.\n\nGoogle Wi-Fi\n\nGoogle is also touting a new router and Wi-Fi manager to adjust the internet connection in the home. Google WiFi automatically finds the strongest Wi-Fi point if you move around in your home. It also comes with an app, so you can -- for example -- turn Wi-Fi off when it's time for dinner.\n\nGoogle Home\n\nWe got a sneak peek at Google Home -- Google's voice-controlled smart speaker -- back in May, but Google has finally shared more details about the gadget.\n\nTo start, the device is priced at $129 -- about $50 cheaper than the Amazon Echo. It has a slight leg up from Amazon's speaker too: Google Home pulls from the 70 billion facts the company has logged throughout the years.\n\nIt comes loaded with Google Assistant -- the company's software that searches for answers, schedules meetings, adjusts your calendar and controls smart home devices such as Philips Hue lights and Nest thermostats (both companies are launch partners).\n\nTo activate Google Home, you'll need to say \"OK, Google\" -- the same keyword that activates Google Now on Android.\n\nIt's available for pre-order in the U.S. now and will launch with a free six-month trial of YouTube Red.",

Cupp is the author of \"Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,\" co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right\" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.\n\nBoston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.\n\nUntil I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.\n\nI'd always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn't decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I'd ever endured.\n\nThe pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally -- it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)\n\nThe pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It's why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It's why I didn't tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he'd spare my next effort.\n\nAs Marion Underwood and Robert Faris' excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.\n\n\"Even before the dawn of social media,\" they write, \"adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist.\"\n\nSo true. I can't imagine my 13-year-old self, na\u00efve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today's unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.\n\nBut while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to \"go viral\") were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?\n\nJUST WATCHED Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think 02:10\n\nNow that I'm a parent of a 10-month-old son, I'm clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents -- especially as parents were either bullies or bullied -- is what kind of kids do we want to raise?\n\nI could be honest and tell you I've had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a \"socially-adept\" child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn't the target of bullying. But we've had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.\n\nLooking back on my difficult year, I'm not sure I'd wish I could have been popular. I do wish I'd been a little more secure.\n\nI'm also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It's anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won't be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.\n\nI think I'm pretty tough. Mine wouldn't be the best job -- regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) -- if I had thin skin.\n\nThere's name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there's stuff you don't prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.\n\nWhen we talk about bullying, it's hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that's among the adults!).\n\nOf course, we're tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to \"just ignore them\" rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.\n\nAs difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it's also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.\n\nBeing 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn't necessarily be that it gets better -- adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It's that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you.",

Nope, it had to be clowns and it had to be mere weeks before Halloween.\n\nThanks, America. This is just great.\n\nThe fear of clowns. Not actually characterized as a psychological disorder, but completely understandable nonetheless.\n\nUnless you've been hiding under a rainbow novelty wig, you know communities around the country have been perturbed by sightings of clowns or possible clown-related threats or any manner of creepiness ranging from flat-out hoaxes to actual credible events.\n\nIt's so weird, even Stephen King wants people to chill.\n\nHey, guys, time to cool the clown hysteria--most of em are good, cheer up the kiddies, make people laugh. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) October 3, 2016\n\nWhen the dad of \"It\" wags a finger at this nonsense, you know it's serious. But still, we need an explanation for why, all of a sudden, there are clowns running amok in our neighborhoods and imaginations. Six (mostly) legitimate possibilities:\n\n1. It's folklore with a modern twist\n\nJUST WATCHED How to follow the Clown Commandments Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How to follow the Clown Commandments 00:58\n\nBenjamin Radford is a folklorist and the author of the non-fiction book \" Bad Clowns ,\" so he's definitely someone you'd want to call with any clown-related concerns. He says the current fad we're enduring is nothing new, and similar waves of stories and hysteria have happened before.\n\n\"In the 1980s, there were these 'phantom' clown reports,\" he says. \"There were stories out of Massachusetts of schoolchildren saying they were chased or lured by clowns, and parents and teachers took it seriously.\"\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it's because the pattern closely resembles one of the first clown encounters that tipped off this latest fascination: In August, kids in an apartment complex in Greenville, South Carolina, reported seeing clowns in the woods, trying to lure them into the darkness\n\nIn the '80s, like now, the stories caught on, even though they remained unsubstantiated.\n\n\"Many of those reports were hoaxes, some were pranks, and some were schoolyard rumors, but the stories continued, in Chicago, Baltimore, and even in the UK.\"\n\nIn other words, there's a \"snowball effect,\" Radford says, where rumor and legitimate concern mix with our human penchant for a good story.\n\nThese pranksters and trolls only serve to strengthen a pretty pervasive myth.\n\n2. It's viral marketing\n\nThink about it. It makes sense. Here were are, all talking about clowns. Is someone capitalizing on the fascination?\n\nIt wouldn't be unheard of. Radford says creepy clown imagery has been used in viral marketing before, and the whole point of stunts like that is to get people talking.\n\nIn fact, one creepy clown video from Agawam, Massachusetts , has already been revealed to be a viral marketing stunt for a local haunted house. So even if this whole clown thing didn't start off as a marketing ploy, it's certainly created some fertile ground.\n\nIt's also hard to ignore the fact that, you know, there's a remake of the classic horror story \"It\" coming out next year. While it seems like perfect timing, the movie's makers aren't toying with your delicate emotions just to get you in the theaters. A Warner Brothers spokesman told CNN there is \"absolutely no connection\" between the film and recent clown sightings.\n\n3. It's an expression of human anxiety\n\nClowns are a source of childlike amusement, but they can also be scary and weird. Life is also scary and weird. It's not a coincidence. Perhaps clowns are like specters of anxiety and discomfort, bogeymen that personify our deepest fears.\n\n\"These sorts of panics tend to surface when there's underlying social anxiety,\" Radford says. \"This is an election year, there's lots of political and ideological divisions, there's also of course [the awareness of] school shootings and terrorist attacks.\" That last part explains the kernel of concern from parents and law enforcement. Even IF most of these sightings and incidents are overblown, why take chances?\n\nRadford says the clown sightings of the 1980s came at a similar time -- one of cultural upheaval. \"There was the satanic panic, the hysteria over Dungeons and Dragons, and sensationalized media reports of Satanists trying to abduct children,\" he says.\n\nIt's a different world today, but underlying patterns are the same.\n\n\"These reports get circulated, often sensationalized, there's a smattering of rumors and urban legends, and then there's some idiot who actually dresses up, and then before you know it there's lockdowns and arrests,\" he says.\n\n4. It's a social media fad\n\nIf you want to creep yourself out, scroll through one of the several recently-created \"clown sighting\" Twitter accounts. They're full of horror-movie-quality clown videos, ostensibly documenting clown encounters in the wild. (FYI, the video below has some strong language).\n\nOmaha, Nebraska pic.twitter.com/3VfPxSagEi \u2014 Clown Sightings (@ClownsSightings) October 4, 2016\n\nAmid the sightings -- real or not -- the hashtag #IfISeeAClown took off to predictably hilarious results. Obviously, if we're going to get all upset about clowns, social media users are going to find a way to cash in.\n\n\"The scary clown image is perfect for social media. It is custom-made to go viral,\" Radford says. \"You have something that is both scary and funny. It's this combination of horror and humor, laughter and fears.\"\n\nIt's all part of the folklore tradition, but instead of sharing around fires and whispered bedtime conversations like we used to, we re-tweet and post about it, embellishing and adding additional touches along the way.\n\n\"It's called ostentation,\" Radford says. \"The idea that you are enacting a legend. People see this scary clown narrative happening on the news, and they're like, 'Hey I want to be a part of this!'\"\n\n5. It's an alternate reality game\n\nJUST WATCHED Reality vs. fantasy: Do kids get it? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Reality vs. fantasy: Do kids get it? 04:01\n\nDo you remember Slenderman, the creepy internet character that figured into a brutal teenage stabbing case in 2014\n\nTo some people, Slenderman was part of what is called an \"alternate reality game.\" No, not like Pokemon Go, which is an \"augmented\" reality game -- think of them more like puzzles and interactive narratives that supposedly take place in the real world and are told over various platforms. It's a souped-up version of a myth, and part of the fun of an ARG is immersing yourself in the make-believe of it all.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThere's no hard evidence to suggest this clown fad is actually part of an official or organized alternate reality game, but given the way it's spread and documented online, it's not hard to imagine the spirit of ARGs has infused some of the storytelling. Imagine this situation: Someone dresses up like a clown or leaves a clown artifact around for someone else to find and document.\n\nCLOWN CLIMBS TO THE TOP OF HIGHWAY BILLBOARD IN NEW JERSEY pic.twitter.com/FzysGz2znL \u2014 Clown Sightings (@CLOWNlNGS) October 5, 2016\n\n6.

Call it Occam's Rubber Nose.\n\nBut if you really want to take it seriously, the recent spate of creepy clown news is disturbing precisely because it's hard to tell where myth ends and reality begins -- we know, intellectually, that it's mostly a bunch of hogwash, but then someone gets arrested for making violent clown threats and we start to question it all.",

MUST WATCH Trump campaign grapples with tax bombshell 02:00\n\nTrump's vision of capitalism is amoral. This is not to say that he is a bad person: he has raised plenty of money for charity and his presidential campaign betrays a deep concern for his country. But when it comes to doing business, he seems to think that the capitalist should do whatever it takes to turn a profit.\n\nTradesmen complain that he would make orders and then argue over how much he had to pay, if he paid them at all. It is claimed that banks would make massive loans, Trump would announce that he couldn't meet the payments , and they would then have to bail him out because he was \"too big to fail.\" Again, the counter argument is that you want someone that brilliantly disingenuous on your side -- \"set a thief to catch a thief\", the old saying goes. But this depressing view of human relations is a betrayal of the founding principles of America, in which it was asserted that most people left alone would tend towards self-discipline, while a little law would iron out the rest.\n\nCapitalism is supposed to inculcate morals. It assumes that people will honor deals, that a product is as good as the seller says it is, that theft is wrong. Capitalism and democracy work well together because authoritarian states undermine private property and distort the market. But a state is necessary -- always necessary -- to enforce the law and make sure the market works along agreed lines. In other words, by failing to pay taxes Trump not only did something bad in and of itself -- he also did something that weakened capitalism by weakening the state. You can't have good capitalism without good infrastructure, effective courts and well-trained cops.\n\nTimothy Stanley\n\nWorse, he helped tarnish the free market's reputation. If anything will eventually push America towards socialism, it will be the terrible image of its white-collar elites. Liberals have been telling the middle-classes for years that they pay an awful lot more for the terrible services they get.\n\nThe poor have exemptions and benefits; so do the rich. The difference being that the welfare-dependent non-tax payer ultimately has nothing. The Trumps of this world already have a lot and are given more on the basis that what's good for them is good for us, too. It was popular fury at such injustices that led to progressivism in the early 20th century and the New Deal in the 1930s. Rich guys are being really, really stupid if they think nominating Trump was a smart thing to do for their cause.\n\nNo one likes paying taxes. Those of us who pay them, pay too much. But just as great a sense of injustice comes from those with a lot of money paying too little. It frays public harmony and undermines faith in free market capitalism.\n\nTrump may find that there's an unpopular double standard in asserting that he loves the people while, allegedly, failing to pay what he can towards their upkeep.",

MUST WATCH Inside the world's second fastest elevator. 03:20\n\nThe result is an elegant skyscraper with a daily footfall of 25,000 people, zipping between the building's hotel, office and residential space.\n\n\"The elevatoring strategy required us to bring in high volumes of people ... and the client made a huge investment to try to make sure that happened quickly,\" Forth says.\n\nInside the cabin an indicator shows passengers how fast they are going -- perhaps to prove that they aren't being cheated.\n\nA high-tech air pressure adjustment system that protects ears from popping and blocks any uncomfortable G-force backlash means this lift is so smooth it's hard to believe it's the world's second fastest.\n\nLift me up\n\nIt's not only China that is faced with the challenge of getting people through ever-taller towers with increasing efficiency.\n\nReach 1km into the sky, the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia will be the world's tallest building when completed in 2019.\n\nA building so tall, naturally, requires an exceptionally fast elevator.\n\nThe CTF Tower in Zhujiang New Town in Guangzhou, Southern China.\n\nFinnish maker Kone has risen to the challenge, developing the \"ultrarope\" elevator, which uses a carbon-fibre cable strong enough to power a lift more than 1km in length -- previously, about 500km was the maximum length possible for a lift cable.\n\nOne third of the weight of traditional lift ropes, it also makes super speeds a reality.\n\nThe ultrarope lift will travel at \"over 33 feet per second\", and \"reach the highest liveable floor in the world in 52 seconds,\" according to Kone.\n\nWhen finally unveiled, it could easily be faster than Hitachi's creation. However, Albert So, an expert in elevator engineering, believes lift technology can't get much faster\n\n\"I predict the maximum speed of a vertical lift cabin cannot be more than 79 feet per second,\" he says. \"This is not because we can't make lifts that go faster than this, but because of the air pressure.\"\n\nIf a lift traveled faster than this, he says, it wouldn't give passengers enough time to acclimatize to the air pressure on the top floor.\n\nEngineers would need to pressurize the entire building, like an airplane cabin.\n\nLifts that move sideways?\n\nPerhaps the most exciting innovation in lift technology is coming from German transport firm Thyssenkrupp.\n\nBy using magnetic levitation, or \"maglev\" technology -- which uses magnetic fields rather than elevator cables to propel cabins -- the company is proposing elevators that move both vertically and horizontally.\n\nThis type of elevator would be slower, at least initially, but it could increase travel efficiency throughout a sprawling building.\n\nPhotos: Timber and bamboo -- wooden buildings are branching out Photos: Timber and bamboo -- wooden buildings are branching out Wooden skyscrapers \u2013 This floating wooden pavilion is the Pavillion of Reflections in Zurich.

    "text": "(CNN) Wood is being billed as the answer to creating greener cities -- lightweight and sustainable, it is even said to be more fire resistant than steel.\n\nThe newest addition to the timber trend is a proposed 19-storey structure that will be built in the Swedish city of Skelleftea.\n\nDesigned by architecture firm White Arkitekter , it was the winning submission in a competition to design a cultural center and hotel in the Swedish city.\n\nThe \"Sida vid Sida\" -- its name translated to side by side\" -- submission was praised for paying tribute to the city's rich local timber industry, and the multiple design benefits attributed to wood as a building material.\n\nOnce complete, the 19-storey structure is expected to become the tallest wooden building in the Nordic countries.\n\nSpreading like wildfire\n\nAn explosion of timber towers, either built or proposed, has gripped the architecture world over the past five years, every one seemingly a recorder holder in some respect.\n\nIn 2012, the 10-story, 104-feet-high Forte residential block was erected overlooking Melbourne's Victoria Harbour.\n\nIt was the world's tallest timber building until The Treet in Central Bergen, Norway, stole that title in 2014, with an extra four stories.\n\nOakwood Tower would be London's tallest wooden skyscraper.\n\nLast year, the Cube, a 109-feet-high apartment block in London's Shoreditch, became \"the tallest cross-laminated timber structure in Europe,\" according to its developers.\n\nIn Canada, work has begun on the descriptively named Tall Wood Building, which will provide student digs at the University of British Columbia.\n\nAt 174 feet and 18 stories tall, it was set to be the world's tallest building, until the Oakwood Tower came along.\n\nThe Oakwood Tower is a proposed joint project by PLP Architecture and Cambridge University's Department of Architecture. It's an experiment in pushing the frontiers of building with wood, and is part of a growing movement to build in timber.\n\nThe 80-story tower, if given the green light for construction, will be made of timber -- making it London's first wooden skyscraper and the tallest wooden structure in the world.\n\nAt 1,000 feet tall, it will only be overshadowed in London by The Shard.\n\nBranching out\n\nNew types of ultra-strong timber are partly driving the trend.\n\n\"There's a whole bunch of new materials made out of wood that are structurally able to build big buildings,\" says Dr. Michael Ramage, of the Center for Natural Material Innovation at Cambridge University.\n\nCross-laminated timber, for example, sees thin layers of wood placed across one another at right angles, and laminated with fire-resistant glue to create a stronger weave.\n\nBut it's bamboo -- a material that has been used in Asian construction for centuries -- that most interests Ramage.\n\nWith a five-times higher growth rate than wood, but similar mechanical properties, there are 31.4 million hectares of bamboo worldwide, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization.\n\n\"We're working on engineered bamboo,\" says Ramage. \"We can take the walls of bamboo tubes, cut them up into rectangles and glue them into big slabs.\n\n\"You get large pieces of what looks like lumber. But it's stronger than timber.\"\n\nKevin Flanagan, a partner at PLP architects, adds that in the future he can imagine the industry genetically modifying wood to make it even more conducive to high-rise construction.\n\nLondon's burning?\n\nObviously, when it comes to wooden buildings, there's one burning question.\n\nAre timber skyscrapers a fire hazard?\n\nRamage says Oakwood Tower -- which will be an extension of the Barbican Center in Central London -- will exceed the fire standards of regular steel and concrete buildings.\n\nHis center has been awarded \u00a3250,000 ($353,785) from the Engineering Physical Sciences Research Council in the UK to research timber construction techniques, such as fire proofing.\n\n\"There is a huge perception problem,\" says Ramage. \"Timber doesn't burn in the way the public imagines.\n\n\"The great fires of London and Chicago were both sparked by very small pieces of wood. Very big pieces of wood are quite hard to set on fire -- they aren't kindling material.\"\n\nWood, he says, burns predictably. Therefore, fire engineers can calculate how large a block of wood is needed to provide a protective layer to sustain a building for a certain period of time.\n\n\"All buildings over a certain size need to have sprinklers and active fire suppression systems -- irrelevant of whether it's wood, concrete or steel,\" he adds.\n\nA series of blazes at Dubai skyscrapers in recent years have highlighted that it isn't just timber buildings at risk of catching fire.\n\nDoes wood make us happier?\n\nAccording to Flanagan, wooden buildings have a positive psychological effect on people.\n\n\"People tend to feel relaxed around wooden buildings,\" says Flanagan. \"People associate wood with green spaces, they have an affinity to it. There would be a real benefit to introducing wooden structures to the cities where people live.\"\n\nIn 2009, the Austrian Joanneum Research Institute compared four classrooms: two with timber flooring, ceilings and cupboards, and two fitted with linoleum floors, plasterboard walls and chipboard cupboards.\n\nChildren working in the timber classrooms, researchers found, were more relaxed, displaying lower heart rates.\n\nAren't we meant to be saving the rainforest?\n\nYes. According to the World Wildlife Organization, up to 58,000 square miles of forest are lost each year -- that's equivalent to 48 football fields every minute.\n\nBut Ramage explains that Oakwood Towers, if approved, would be built from \"white wood\" -- that is, crops grown over a 40-year-period specifically for construction purposes.\n\n\"Russia has huge timber reserves, largely because we're finally using less paper,\" he explains.\n\nIn fact, using wood could be more sustainable. Ramage says wood is, on average, four times lighter than concrete, so transporting it uses less energy.\n\nFurthermore, timber buildings are increasingly being assembled in a factory, and then craned into position and fixed together on site -- like an Ikea-style skyscraper that can \"self-assemble\".\n\n\"This has huge time and financial savings implications,\" says Flanagan.\n\nWon't wood rot?\n\nFrom the magnificent Tudor timber arches of Westminster Hall in London to the wooden rooftops of the Forbidden City in Beijing, wood has been used to construct some of the world's most beautiful, iconic buildings.\n\nAnd they haven't fallen victim to rot.\n\n\"We know from a very long history of building in wood it can last -- we have 600, 700-year-old buildings in the UK which are fine,\" says Ramage. \"The one constant they have is that they have all been well looked after.\"",

    "text": "Story highlights Michael Lind: The industrial Internet will shatter old systems and create opportunities\n\nNew laws and regulations will be needed in the new world of machine communications\n\nMichael Lind is a fellow at the New America Foundation and author of \"Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States.\" This is the latest in a series, \"Big Ideas for a New America,\" in which the think tank New America spotlights experts' solutions to the nation's greatest challenges. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) Make way, old Internet: a new Internet is arriving. Thanks first to desktop and laptop PCs and more recently to smartphones and tablets, the familiar Internet has transformed the way we work and play by revolutionizing how people communicate with each other. In the next phase of the information revolution, with the help of wireless technology and a galaxy of sensors, the industrial Internet will shatter old systems and create new opportunities, by enabling machines to talk to machines.\n\nMichael Lind\n\nGE introduced the now-widespread term \"the industrial Internet\" for the subset of the emerging Internet of things that includes manufacturing, transportation and other parts of the productive economy. The industrial Internet includes hardware, in the form of sensors embedded in assembly lines, appliances, and autonomous vehicles like robocars and civilian and military drones. It also generates enormous amounts of information \u2014 big data \u2014 that can be sorted and analyzed for purposes of product and process innovation, repair and marketing.\n\nBusiness models are likely to be transformed in some industries by the industrial Internet. In old-fashioned manufacturing, maintenance was often a secondary goal to assembly, and was often carried out by other businesses. Companies, and jobs, could usually be assigned to manufacturing or service sectors. But now diagnostic and prognostic technology embedded in products and communicating over networks can permit manufacturers to continuously monitor products and correct problems in advance. The result of this infrastructure is \"servitization\" -- that is, a blend of manufacturing and services in a single firm. The company can be responsible not only for the creation of a product, but also for its lifetime care and, in some cases, its ultimate recycling.\n\nHere are some examples. The agricultural equipment company John Deere has a telematics system that allows farmers to track machine productivity and schedule preventive maintenance. The three major aircraft engine manufacturers \u2014 GE, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls Royce \u2014 offer a \"power by the hour\" model in which, instead of selling engines, the manufacturers retain ownership and lease them to airlines, to enable servicing throughout the engine's lifetime.\n\nPreventive monitoring and maintenance need not be a monopoly of high-power machines. Similar innovations may break down traditional barriers between industry and medicine. Imagine the benefits for health \u2014 and the potential savings -- if pacemakers and other medical implants or wearable medical sensors were in constant contact with a network of hospitals and doctors.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "This is an edited excerpt from \"The Blind Photographer\" published by Redstone Press, and edited by Mel Gooding and Julian Rothenstein.\n\nThis is the question most often asked by people when they first hear about photographs taken by the blind. The answer is much the same as that of the broader question: How does anyone take photographs?\n\nIt depends on the sort of photograph different people want to take, on the circumstances in which they find themselves, on the diverse motives and purposes they may have for taking a photograph, and so on.\n\nThe machinery of photography is fundamentally simple: it is designed to catch the image that light creates on objects by means of a lens and mechanical processes (these vary and develop in sophistication, but the principle doesn't alter). Being blind or sighted, having a camera, having a subject and a desire to make a visual image of it, the camera is pointed in the right direction and a button is pressed.\n\nHey presto! A photograph!\n\nSome sighted people have become very skilled at manipulating the devices of light measurement, the length of exposure, color and tonal modification, etc. Some have not. (I am among the latter.)\n\nBut the huge number of possible uses to which photography has been put has taught us that the use of these technical devices does not necessarily increase the interest of a photograph, or affect the value we place upon it. We, the sighted, look at photographs in a hundred different ways. We look for different things, for different purposes. We make judgments accordingly.\n\n\"Tanvir Bush with Matt Larsen-Daw of Photovoice\" (2009) by Mikel Smithen\n\nThe most sophisticated photographers in the world have often used the simplest cameras in the simplest ways; the most skilled and technically proficient photographers using the most advanced gear cannot guarantee that others will find their photographs interesting, beautiful, useful, or valuable.\n\nMoreover, no photographer, however accomplished, can know how any photograph will turn out. Most professional photographers in any field take many in order to find out which shots will be successful, in whatever terms are relevant to a particular shoot. Think of those innumerable contact sheets, in which, out of dozens, one photo is selected.\n\nThe blind photographer has, like every other photographer, an idea of what he or she wants to achieve. The blind photographer has a body, a mind, a purpose and/or a desire; the blind photographer spends life in complex relations to other people, sighted and blind, and to objects in the world.\n\nLike any other photographer he or she may seek practical help and advice from others: to adjust the camera, to set up a subject, to catch an image on the wing using the simple machinery of the camera.\n\nWhat the sighted viewer makes of an image is a matter of individual response, just as it would be to any other image. From the exchanges of such viewers, the interest, usefulness and value of a particular image in the vast world of such images will be determined.\n\nThe blind photographer takes photographs just like any other photographer.",

She is also a former Congressional Black Caucus executive director and general counsel. You can follow her on Twitter @angela_rye and on Instagram @angelarye . The views expressed are her own.\n\n(CNN) I have been adamantly opposed to Donald Trump's candidacy from the first time he glided down the escalator at Trump Tower and descended into the pits of the worst parts of rhetoric against humankind by calling Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists. It is because of that moment -- and so many thereafter -- that I never believed this reality star had a legitimate chance or frankly that he was serious about running for president.\n\nBut then came the deadline for candidates to file the Federal Election Commission's financial disclosure form -- he filed. \"Oh no ... he is serious about running,\" I thought. Still, the American people -- including GOP primary voters -- wouldn't take him seriously, would they? America in 2016 after two terms of the first black President is no place for birtherism and Trump's brand of bigotry, is it?\n\nI believed Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" which so obviously left out large swaths of Americans who make this country amazing every single day, could not possibly resonate. But it did. His base nostalgically reflected back to the good ole days of the 1950s (which, of course, also preceded integration) that weren't so good for many Americans.\n\nAnd Trump began winning debates. He was on a roll and won primary after primary. I tried to do my part in highlighting just how dangerous a Trump presidency would be for our great, but challenged country. Nevertheless, 13.3 million votes later, Trump became the GOP nominee. So, I dug in. I focused all of my energy on showing the American people what I thought was obvious: his lack of preparation, his childish behavior, his treacherous relationship with the truth and his blatant phobia for anything \"other.\"\n\nI did not think I needed to address my lack of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton because I believed getting everyone to see how much of a nonoption Trump was would ensure her victory. Again, I made a grave mistake. Enthusiasm to be for something or someone in an election is quite literally the difference between a win and loss. We see it in polls: There is a difference in numbers between registered voters (where Clinton has historically performed much better) and likely voters (where Trump tightens her lead or bests Clinton).\n\nThere are two reasons I haven't written this piece before now. One is that I have not been particularly excited about this election. The second reason is that I didn't believe that Clinton could mean what Barack Obama means to me -- flaws and all. The fact is that Hillary Rodham Clinton is no Barack Hussein Obama.\n\nBut while it's true that Clinton brings her own flaws to this election, she also brings her own set of strengths and qualifications to the table. In fact, as Obama has noted, \"There has never been a man or a woman more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States.\"\n\nBut some of y'all just are not feeling Hillz.\n\n\"Why is she so shady?\" I have friends who say things like: \"Hillary just seems shady.\" But my response to that is simple: Clinton is guarded. Yes, she can come across as defensive and combative. Frankly, though, I do not know a single human being who could endure the level of scrutiny she has without having some kind of wall up. Her demeanor means it can be hard for her to connect emotionally, but that guarded persona is not the one most recognizable to those who really know Clinton. It is easy for people to misinterpret guarded for shady. Our gut feelings can be wrong -- and many times are.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\"#NeverForget. She did President Obama dirty.\" There are people who say that they might have supported her, but they are disillusioned by the way she treated Obama in 2008. My response? The President not only moved on, but he nominated her as secretary of state. He invited her into his inner circle to assist in making critical decisions for his administration. And now the President, Vice President Joe Biden and first lady Michelle Obama are campaigning for her.\n\n\"Who is she calling super-predator?\" Still, many others are troubled by Clinton using the term \"super predator\" in describing children who committed crime during a 1990s speech (a terrible word choice widely interpreted as speaking about black people). I have no intention of ever defending this statement -- it is one of the most ignorant statements I have ever heard. We should acknowledge, however, that she has apologized for using the term (unlike her opponent, who has demonstrated an inability to apologize for running with birtherism until two weeks ago). She acknowledged that \" Still, many others are troubled by Clinton using the term \"super predator\" in describing children who committed crime during a 1990s speech (a terrible word choice widely interpreted as speaking about black people).

We should acknowledge, however, that she has apologized for using the term (unlike her opponent, who has demonstrated an inability to apologize for running with birtherism until two weeks ago). She acknowledged that \" we haven't done right by them \" in her apology and has a lifelong record of advocacy for communities of color. And if you believe in lifelong commitments to causes like I do, you should respect her time working for the Children's Defense Fund , her efforts to register voters of color, and her hiring of diverse staff as first lady, in the US Senate, and at the State Department. Additionally, I can personally attest to the efforts of her Senate office as I worked with them on protecting Title III Part B funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities when I worked at the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education\n\n\"Somebody get her WhatsApp -- stat.\" And of course, those damn emails. As a former Capitol Hill staffer, advising bosses is something I took (and still take) very seriously. As a lawyer, I know ethics rules can be complicated. It is incumbent upon staff members not only to keep their very busy bosses apprised of what is right but also to ensure the optics are right to preserve public trust. Undoubtedly using a private server was ill-advised, but I firmly believe she was trying to protect her personal life from any further public display. (Thirty years is a lot of time, particularly when you consider the shame and humiliation she also has had to endure.) She has admitted it was a terrible mistake. One that has been heavily politicized and a distraction the campaign has struggled to address appropriately for months.\n\nAs I watched Monday night's debate , it became abundantly clear to me there never was a binary choice, that there is no choice at all. The debate made me an advocate. I watched someone who is presidential. I watched someone who is decisive, clear, poised and brilliant. I saw, for the first time, the candidate that most of my former bosses adore so much they have spent the last several months on the campaign trail as surrogates. I saw Hillary Clinton present and deliver the very best version of herself to the American people. The debate was a defining moment for me. My mandate was clear: I must do all I can to ensure Hillary Clinton is elected on Election Day.\n\nI am all in now. We know Drake said: \"Better late than never, but never late is better.\"\n\nI am definitely late, but I am also all in. And after Monday's debate, I am all in with an enthusiasm I did not have at the beginning of this campaign. I am all in because I want our 45 to be just as distinct, historic and brilliant as our 44. I am all in because she is a fighter for the little guy (and girl) -- and her record says so. I am all in because she has policy proposals that best serve the interests of constituencies I am a part of, namely women, people of color and young people. I am all in because while Hillary Clinton does not have it all right, these constituencies will have a seat at the table and where our voices matter. And I am all in because it is clearer than ever that unless all of us show up to be counted on Election Day, an enthusiasm gap over a decisive, clear, poised and brilliant candidate could leave the door open for someone unfit and unqualified. #dealmeinHillz #ImwithHER",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) The logo for the CITES \"world wildlife conference\" underway in South Africa features a bunch of animals you'd readily associate with the international conservation movement.\n\nElephants, sharks, rhinos and tigers.\n\nAnd then there's the pangolin.\n\nIt's a scale-covered ant eater you might not have heard of, much less recognize.\n\nYet the pangolin has become the star of that summit, which is where countries agree on rules that govern the international trade in rare and endangered species. This awkward, introverted creature, which has been compared to a walking pinecone and an artichoke with legs, is thought to be the most trafficked mammal in the world . And on Wednesday, a subcommittee at CITES recommended all eight pangolin species be banned from international commercial trade.\n\nThat move, if confirmed by a plenary session of the meeting next week, is long overdue.\n\nAnd it could save these eight rare species from extinction.\n\nI've long argued the pangolin needs international celebrity to survive, and the CITES vote is a critical step toward achieving that celebrity. According to Ginette Hemley, WWF's senior vice president for wildlife conservation, the pangolin is one of the highest-priority animals at the international wildlife conference.\n\n\"It's become a real cause,\" she told me by phone from South Africa. \"They're so unique. They're so different. There's nothing like them in the world. They've just captured the imagination of a lot of people and a lot of the CITES parties as well. They seem so vulnerable as a species.\"\n\nA photo posted by WildAid (@wildaid) on Sep 26, 2016 at 7:02pm PDT\n\nI used to worry pangolins would go extinct before anyone knew they existed. Now it's clear that the pangolin is becoming known -- and that visibility, along with these protections, could save it. The question is whether recognition is coming soon enough.\n\nAlready, according to WildAid, 1 million pangolins have been trafficked illegally in the last 15 years. That's only the animals that have been intercepted, often in shipments measured by the ton. Perhaps 10 times that number has been trafficked, said Peter Knights, executive director of WildAid. In my view, the internationally community has largely turned a blind eye to this crisis, preferring to focus on the conservation of big, cute \"charismatic\" species, like the elephant, rhino and panda.\n\nBut the CITES recommendation to ban commercial trade of all pangolin species is a critical step. In wildlife-law speak, the pangolins were recommended to be moved from CITES Appendix II, which offers fewer protections, to CITES Appendix I. That will stiffen fines and jail time for pangolin traffickers, according to experts.\n\nOn its own, this won't curb demand for pangolin scales, which are used in traditional medicine in Vietnam and China. Or for pangolin meat, which is seen as a rare and highly expensive delicacy in those countries. But it will make getting those products to market far more difficult.\n\n\"People basically get a slap on the wrist\" for trafficking pangolin under current regulations, Knights told me. In China, which is thought to be the biggest market for illegal pangolin products, pangolin traffickers now could face 10 years in jail, he said.\n\nHemley credited a 2014 CNN investigation with launching this new enthusiasm at CITES.\n\n\"Your initial story on this really put this issue on the map, and it's a been a huge deal,\" she said. \"It's helped galvanize almost a pangolin movement. Seriously. Looking around here everyone is carrying around these plush pangolins. They have these give-aways. I haven't got one myself, they're in such hot demand.\"\n\nI had a hard time imagining \"plush pangolins\" at a business-suit type conference.\n\nBut, thankfully, there's Instagram.\n\nA video posted by WWF South Africa (@wwfsouthafrica) on Sep 25, 2016 at 12:38am PDT\n\nA photo posted by Pro Wildlife (@pro_wildlife) on Sep 26, 2016 at 2:30am PDT\n\nA photo posted by UN Postal Administration (@unstamps) on Sep 26, 2016 at 8:53am PDT\n\nThe CITES recommendations on Wednesday are a great start, but those rules won't be enough to save the pangolin on their own. Conservation groups must continue to try to make the use of pangolin products uncool in Asia.\n\nCNN's audience has helped with this, donating about $20,000 to fund an anti-pangolin poaching advertisement that aired nationally in Vietnam. It starred a newscaster who's been called \"the Anderson Cooper\" of Vietnam.\n\nWildAid is enlisting other celebrities to try to spread a similar message in China and Vietnam.\n\nThe pangolin's emerging fame may be its saving grace.\n\nI'm grateful CITES negotiators finally voted to recognize this.",

He was the policy director of the Romney-Ryan 2012 campaign and served as Governor Mitt Romney's chief policy adviser. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Bill Clinton raised some eyebrows on the campaign trail Monday when he declared that Obamacare \"is the craziest thing in the world.\" He assailed the law for escalating health care costs and decreasing health plan choices amongst middle-income Americans. The critique of Obamacare, which was entirely accurate, was surprising particularly because it puts his wife -- an ardent defender of the law -- in an awkward political position going into Sunday's second presidential debate.\n\nPerhaps even more surprising has been the fact that Donald Trump hasn't more directly and forcefully used this same line of attack against Obamacare and, by extension, Hillary Clinton. In fact, Trump failed to mention Obamacare's failings even once during the last week's presidential debate. Anyone involved in Trump's debate preparations for this weekend's matchup should ensure that he does not allow the entirety of another debate to pass without some mention of Obamacare's shortcomings.\n\nBill Clinton's defenders have argued that his comments about Obamacare were taken out of context; that what he was actually advocating for was the need for changes to be made to the law so that it functions more effectively.\n\nThe problem isn't that the health care law needs to be tweaked, or that the rising premiums and declining choices that consumers face are surprises that require a course-correction. Indeed, the law was so poorly designed and conceived that these problems were entirely predictable.\n\nRead More",

They're children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents' basement.\"\n\nShe continued: \"If you're feeling like you're consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot, and doesn't have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. I think we all should be really understanding of that.\"\n\nRead More",

That's why the objectivity of this data, and so of all the conclusions made based on it, leaves us with doubt.\"\n\nProsecutor: 100 people linked\n\nEvidence presented by the JIT Wednesday included intercepted phone calls, witness accounts and material on social media that investigators said established the missile system's route in a convoy into Ukraine, which was displayed in a computer-generated animation.\n\nPhotos: Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashes in Ukraine Debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 sits in a field at the crash site in Hrabove, Ukraine, on September 9, 2014.

    "text": "Lifesaving care for people in rural India will soon come through an app.\n\nIntelehealth, founded by students at Johns Hopkins University, makes an app that lets health workers in rural communities act as a proxy for doctors who are unable to work in underserved areas themselves.\n\nIndia has just one doctor for every 1,700 people, and while 70% of the population is in rural areas, about 60% of the healthcare infrastructure is in cities.\n\nHealth workers in remote areas are trained on very basic care -- they can't offer tests or consults on things like diabetes or asthma, according to Intelehealth founder and CEO Neha Goel.\n\n\"They can only refer them to a doctor, or the patient ends up self-medicating -- going to the pharmacy and getting over the counter pills with no prescription,\" Goel, 26, said. \"Our approach is to digitize the way primary healthcare is delivered.\"\n\nDuring the pilot program, Goel said she met a former schoolteacher in his seventies who lives with chronic joint pain and diabetes, and can now better manage those issues by consulting a doctor digitally. In another instance, an eight-month-old baby was diagnosed with spina bifida through the app, and referred to a hospital for surgery.\n\nBefore, they would have had to travel hundreds of miles, often spending a month's wages, to see a doctor. App-powered diagnoses save patients time and money. As a result, Goel said, people trust their health workers more, and are less likely to delay care.\n\nWhen a patient arrives at a clinic, the health worker uses Intelehealth to create a record with demographic and personal data, any issues a patient is having, and photos. The patient summary is sent to an offsite Indian doctor, often a retired physician, who makes a diagnosis and sends it back to the clinic with a prescription or referral for further care.\n\nPatient data is collected and encrypted, but some data will be anonymized and used for research, like recognizing health patterns or the spread of disease in geographic areas.\n\nThere are a wide variety of conditions that patients present at clinics, and Goel said the company built data collection protocols for 80% of them.\n\nRelated: Seniors swap hospital visits for iPads\n\nUnlike other telemedicine apps, Intelehealth can operate with low bandwidth, meaning even slow connections can load and use the Android app. Neha said when the four-person team began building the product, existing services either required too much bandwidth and couldn't function in rural communities, or had very limited clinical functionality.\n\nOther groups working on telemedicine projects for remote areas include MIT's open-source health project Sana, India's Neurosynaptic's ReMeDi platform, and CliniPAK.\n\nWhile students, Goel's team piloted the tech at two locations in West Bengal, India.

    "text": "The plan to do away with cables box rentals has hit a speed bump.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has delayed a closely watched vote on a proposal that would require large cable and satellite TV companies to make their content available through free apps.\n\nThe vote, originally scheduled to take place on Thursday as part of the commission's monthly meeting, has been postponed indefinitely as the government agency works to iron out details amid intense pushback from cable providers, media companies and politicians.\n\n\"We are still working to resolve the remaining technical and legal issues, and we are committed to unlocking the set-top box for consumers across the country,\" FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said in a joint statement with commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel.\n\nThe commission hopes to vote on the issue \"within the next couple weeks,\" but there is \"no deadline\" set at this point, according to an FCC official who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to share details.\n\nThe FCC proposal promises to finally eliminate the need for consumers to rent a cable box, which costs households an average of $231 a year, according to the FCC.\n\nInstead of paying to rent a box, a Comcast (CCV) subscriber would have the option to stream shows through a Comcast app on their smart TV, tablet, Roku and Apple TV. Pay TV providers would also be forced to make their content searchable through third-party applications, making it easier for users to find where various shows and movies are streaming.\n\nHowever, the most recent version of the proposal, unveiled earlier this month, angered much of the industry with a provision around licensing.\n\nThe FCC's plan would require cable companies to create a new licensing body to establish guidelines for device makers on issues like search and security -- all under the oversight of the FCC.\n\nRelated: Google vs. the cable guys: the big fight over the little set-top box in your home\n\nOfficials from Time Warner (TWX), Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox and other media companies held a \"series of meetings\" with the FCC last week to stress that the agency was overstepping its authority and \"should refrain from exercising any and all form of oversight or review\" over licensing, according to a filing.\n\nRosenworcel, a key vote needed to approve the proposal, also expressed concerns about the licensing provision.\n\nThe delay comes six months after Wheeler first rattled the cable industry and set off a fury of lobbying with a proposal to make the set-top box market more competitive.\n\nUnder that original FCC plan, cable and satellite providers would have been forced to make their raw TV streams available on competing cable devices likely to be built by Google (GOOGL, Tech30), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and others.\n\nThe FCC framed the plan as a way to make the cable box market more competitive and eliminate the need for households to spend an unnecessary amount of money leasing the devices.\n\nHowever, AT&T (T, Tech30), Comcast and others slammed the first proposal for giving tech companies like Google potentially unfettered access to their programming.\n\nIn response, the industry pushed what it called the \"Ditch the Box\" proposal, which focused on rethinking cable apps rather than cable boxes.\n\nThe final FCC proposal adopts the framework of that apps plan, which gives cable companies greater control over how their content appears.",

    "text": "Commuters in a New York City suburb can now get free or discounted Uber rides.\n\nThe town of Summit, New Jersey said it will subsidize the cost of Uber trips to alleviate parking congestion near its train station. The move will save taxpayers $5 million across 20 years -- what it would cost to build a new parking lot, according to a press release.\n\nThe pilot program will involve about 100 residents and run for six months (it's now accepting applications to be a part of the test). If successful, it could expanded to more users.\n\n\"[The] program is the first of its kind in the United States to use ridesharing technology as a parking solution,\" Mayor Nora Radest said in the statement.\n\nRelated: New Yorkers can now schedule Uber pickups\n\nRiders who have already paid for a parking permit ($4 daily) will not need to pay for an Uber trip to the station. For those who haven't purchased a pass, it will cost $2 a ride. Summit pays the actual fare or the difference.\n\nAlthough this is the first commuter ridesharing program related to parking, Uber is trying to work with local governments to solve other problems. For example, Uber -- as well as its competitor Lyft -- wants to partner with Miami-Dade County to use federal grants to subsidize rides to two train stations. It aims to increase the use of public transportation by getting people to transit hubs.\n\nUber has other similar initiatives under way in California and Florida, too. In those cases, cities and private real estate developers offer residents certain perks, such as credits toward Uber rides, to cut down on parking woes or lure potential renters.\n\nRelated: What it feels like to sit in a self-driving Uber\n\nThe city of Summit says \"thousands\" of residents already use Uber, and over a third of them hail rides during morning and evening commutes.\n\nThe new program limits subsidized trips to those within city limits or to and from the train station. Trips must also occur on weekdays from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.",

    "text": "CNN Travel's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.\n\nHong Kong (CNN) It may not seem like it from the middle of a traffic jam in the narrow backstreets of Wan Chai, but Hong Kong is a destination made for driving.\n\nYes, downtown snarl-ups are a way of life -- but Hong Kong's visually arresting cityscape is as spectacular at a snail's pace as it is when viewed from a speeding automobile.\n\nAnd beyond the high-rise towers, the territory opens up into an incredible drivers' playground, where smooth, empty highways switchback across subtropical forests and misty hilltops before swooping down to golden beaches.\n\nWith some of these fabulous scenic routes beyond even the reach of Hong Kong's famously efficient public transport system, the only way to enjoy them is by car.\n\nIn honor of FIA Formula E's inaugural race in Hong Kong , we asked a few locals who're intimately familiar with their city's network of arteries to share some of their own favorite rides.\n\nAfter all, unlike the drivers taking part in the October 9 ePrix race, not everyone can enjoy the thrill of racing an automobile on a street circuit through the heart of Hong Kong's Central Harbourfront area.\n\nTai Tam Road to Shek O Road\n\nThis narrow stretch of Tai Tam Road leads into the lush mountains of Shek O.\n\nThe road to Shek O, a tiny beach town on the southeastern leg of Hong Kong Island, is just a short distance away from the city's hustle.\n\nStarting on Tai Tam Road, the route passes over the imposing Tai Tam Tuk dam -- completed in 1917 -- and leads into Shek O Road's lush hills and beautiful coastal views.\n\n\"The scenery here is beautiful,\" says Desmund, the proud owner of a McLaren 12C Spider, who knows the road's curves by heart. \"It's almost un-Hong-Kong-like.\"\n\nDesmund should know.\n\nHe was part of the Sunday Morning Drive Club, a group of supercar owners who regularly hit the road together, savoring traffic-free 7 a.m. rides across Hong Kong.\n\nTheir drives usually end with breakfast at a street side village cafe: a bite of buttered toast with milk tea, Cantonese-style.\n\nThe breakfast stop is crucial, says Desmund. It gives their liberating drives a sweet destination.\n\nLuk Keng to Bride's Pool\n\nHome to a few villages and scenic sites for waterside picnics, Luk Keng is a popular area for drivers.\n\nLuk Keng sits near Hong Kong's frontier with mainland China, offering views of Shenzhen, the huge, sprawling metropolis just beyond the border.\n\nThis route through HK's northeastern New Territories connects to Tai Mei Tuk, a site just off the road that offers barbecue and picnic areas by the picturesque Plover Cove Reservoir.\n\nA series of waterfalls and pools known as Bride's Pool can be reached by a hiking trail that leads, in just under a kilometer, to the bottom of a valley.\n\nWe checked out this stretch of road with veteran taxi driver Chu Chun Ting, who counts Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates among famous people he's chauffeured.\n\nThe athletic driver's been behind the wheel for over 20 years and enjoys his encounters with all kinds of customers.\n\nIf you hop into his car in an elaborate cosplay costume or a beautifying face mask -- both have happened, he says -- chances are he'll take a selfie with you.\n\nThe area is another favorite spot for the supercar fraternity as well.\n\nThere's a decades-old Cantonese eatery along Luk Keng Road just steps away from a marsh that's a popular stop for Sunday drivers.\n\nThis stretch is also busy with cyclists.\n\nSouth Perimeter Road\n\nEven Hong Kongers could be forgiven for not knowing about the South Perimeter Road.\n\nCar lover Edmund Kwok discovered it, tucked at the edge of land reclaimed off Lantau Island to build Hong Kong International Airport, when he was looking for a private spot to do some plane spotting.\n\nOn this borderland, the ongoing construction of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge can be viewed up close, its concrete mouth cleanly cut down the middle.\n\n\"When I was little my father often took us for a drive to Kai Tak Airport,\" Kwok says, name checking Hong Kong's notorious old runway built alarmingly close to housing blocks.\n\n\"There was a place where you could stop by the roadside and watch the planes. Naturally when I became a father I started looking for such a place at the new airport.\"\n\nThe aviation enthusiast first spotted this gem on a map.\n\nSince then, he's visited the boulder-lined pavement facing the South China Sea many times during father-and-son trips in his Porsche 993 Cabriolet.\n\n\"With the hood down we get a vivid experience of the planes applying full throttle and taking off,\" he says.\n\nWith little traffic, straight stretches and corners, this coast-hugging road offers sports cars a nice drive.\n\nSai Kung\n\nThis vast area is famed for its breathtaking trails, plunge pools and barbecue areas.\n\nBut it's hard to take advantage of its many offerings without a car.\n\nTaxi veteran Chu shudders when talking about city traffic, but is most impressed by the drive from Sai Kung's Pak Tam Chung to High Island Reservoir East Dam.\n\n\"As you approach Pak Tam Chung, lines of rich vegetation start to replace village houses,\" says Chu.\n\n\"Outside cars need a permit to reach the East Dam via Pak Tam Chung, so there're fewer cars and you can drive slowly to absorb the scenery from both sides of the reservoir... it forms a perfect composition.\"\n\nHoi Ha Wan, a dazzling marine reserve and coral sanctuary just north of Sai Kung Country Park, offers a unique stop for snorkeling, kayaking and a visit to the village.\n\nFor those not wanting to venture away from luxury, One-thirtyone is a fine dining restaurant nestled in a restored village house with a secluded garden overlooking Three Fathoms Cove.\n\nThe pleasant drive leading to it adds a little flavor.\n\nBut, like Tai Mo Shan (featured below), speed freaks and motorcyclists favor Sai Kung for its lack of traffic rather than scenery.\n\nOne-thirtyone, 131 Tseng Tau Village, Shap Sze Heung, Sai Kung, Hong Kong China;\n\nTai Mo Shan Road\n\nTai Mo Shan is the highest mountain in Hong Kong and China's second tallest coastal peak.\n\nA popular hiking destination with tough trails, the peak's twists and turns make for a fun and breezy ascent by car.\n\nThe top vantage points offer panoramic views of the New Territories, with its sprawling, subtropical hills and dense urban pockets.\n\nIt's also the chilliest point in Hong Kong, attracting \"frost chasers\" who drive all the way up for the rare sightings when a cold spell hits.\n\n#\u5927\u5e3d\u5c71 #\u9999\u6e2f #\u9aee\u593e\u5f4e #\u65c5\u904a #\u9ec3\u660f # \u822a\u62cd #taimoshan #hongkong #travel #sunset #drone #aerial A photo posted by William Li (@william_li_photography) on Sep 28, 2016 at 7:22pm PDT\n\nHow to rent your own wheels\n\nOut-of-towners in search of the Hong Kong high-end motoring experience can rent their own ride at one of several luxury car companies.\n\nAmong them is AVIS Prestige , which offers auto makes like Porsche, Maserati and Mercedes.",

    "text": "(CNN) A full Ironman triathlon is grueling, consisting of a 2.4-mile swim followed by 112 miles on a bicycle and then a 26.2-mile run. All of this is completed in one day, with no stops in between.\n\nNow imagine doing that without being able to see.\n\nVeteran Michael Somsan was shot in the head in 1995, leaving him completely blind. But despite his circumstances, Somsan, now 46, always kept hopes alive of one day completing the most famous triathlon of all: The Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii.\n\nThe location has a special significance for Somsan, a single dad who lives in Gilbert, Arizona. His high school and college years were spent in Hawaii, where he was active surfing, fishing, swimming, running, and cycling. His family lives on Oahu.\n\n\"For me, it almost takes me back to when I was younger, when I was looking at the Ironman and could see all these wonderful athletes doing it, and now I'm here doing this,\" Somsan said in a telephone interview with CNN last month. \"So it takes you back to my youth, takes me back to memories of Hawaii, and of course my family is there.\"\n\nIn #Kona. Ready for action. @IRONMANtri pic.twitter.com/ILyBUK0nOu \u2014 Michael Somsan (@BlindIronMan) October 3, 2016\n\nThere's something else, though, something much deeper. Discovering the Ironman gave Somsan the courage to live, and crossing that finish line will signify the end of a long, emotional journey for the entire family.\n\n\"I know for them, when I first got injured, they just didn't know what to do,\" Somsan said. \"I didn't know what to do. Everything I was afraid to do. I was afraid to do anything, much less an Ironman. So to do this, I don't know how to describe it. It's like climbing Mount Everest.\"\n\nFateful night in 1995\n\nThis wasn't the future Somsan envisioned. His passion was in the US military.\n\nWith his family displaced by the Vietnam War, a 5-year-old Michael moved to the US from Laos. He lived with his uncle, a colonel, and his aunt before his parents arrived. When his parents couldn't afford to send him to college, he decided to join the service to pay for it. He found that he loved being around new cadets and relished the environment.\n\nIn 1995, when he was 24, Somsan was a first lieutenant in the US Army and was engaged to be married. He was enjoying his career.\n\nSomsan, left.\n\n\"I had a full life ahead of me,\" Somsan said. \"I didn't think I was going become disabled and go this other different route.\"\n\nIt all changed one night, while Somsan was visiting a friend's home in Austin, Texas.\n\nThere was a fight outside. By the time Somsan reached the parking lot and headed toward the chaos, it was an all-out brawl.\n\n\"There were guys kicking my friend on the ground, like three or four of them, and I was like, 'What is going on here?'\" Somsan said. \"So then I got into the fight, and it just escalated from there.\"\n\nAccording to Somsan, one of the brawlers had a sword and started chasing Somsan's friend down the street. Somsan got into his Jeep to go help his friend. But then he heard words from another man on the scene.\n\n\"Don't shoot him.\"\n\nThe \"him\" referred to Somsan. And when Somsan looked up, a man was standing right there, at the car's left front wheel, pointing a gun at him.\n\nThen he fired.\n\nSeventy mile ride in the books. Boy it was hot! #determination #ironman#neverbedefeated pic.twitter.com/ufdZLIgvpl \u2014 Michael Somsan (@BlindIronMan) June 5, 2016\n\n'You're blind'\n\n\"I'm surprised my head didn't come off,\" Somsan said. \"When they pulled me out of my Jeep, I was still conscious. When they took me to the ER, I was still conscious. I remember they were trying to get me to stay alert, and eventually, I just couldn't. I just passed out because I was just bleeding a lot.\"\n\nSomsan went into a coma and underwent numerous surgeries. Weeks later, he woke up. He knew he was in the hospital. But it was dark.\n\n\"I had IVs in my arms, and I had tubing in my nose, and I had gauze and bandages all over me,\" Somsan said. \"So I knew that. I kind of remembered that something had happened to me.\n\n\"And that's when I kind of like felt my eyes and just kind of lifted the gauze off my eyes. ...I said, 'Hey, what's going on?' and I said, 'Hey, turn on a light.' And that's when the nurse said, 'You're not going to see anything. You're blind.'\"\n\nSomsan with Bernardo.\n\nSomsan said he later learned the man who shot him was a student who also was a foreign national. But he was never brought to justice. When the man was released on bail, he absconded.\n\nThat was partial motivation for Somsan, now a single dad of two daughters, to become an attorney. But he also had another goal.\n\n\"Ironman has been a part of my life ever since I lived in Hawaii,\" Somsan said. \"So I've seen what the Ironman looks like in terms of competition and just how grueling it is. And I've always been fascinated with the Ironman, but my life just got busy, and I never got back to it. But one day, I will go back.\"\n\nA healing journey\n\nWhen Somsan started doing triathlons, he did something in 2014 that he now calls \"really dumb.\" He completed a sprint triathlon (0.5-mile swim, 12.4 miles on the bike and a 3.1-mile run), an Olympic-distance triathlon (0.93 miles/24.8 miles/6.2 miles), a half Ironman (1.2 miles/56 miles/13.1 miles) and a full Ironman (in Tempe) all in one year.\n\nIn 2015, Somsan did the Arizona Ironman again to make sure it wasn't a fluke. After that, he decided to go for Kona. But that race doesn't accept just anyone -- competitors must qualify. There's also a division for physically challenged athletes, available to those with a medically verified physical, visual, or neurological impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\n\nFive names are selected from the total number of physically challenged applicants. Somsan vied to be one of them.\n\nFor those following @ home on Oct 8th u can use my bib number #168 or search by my last name Somsan. #roadtokona #ironmanworldchampionships pic.twitter.com/Q9Axfbi4Rs \u2014 Michael Somsan (@BlindIronMan) September 23, 2016\n\nAs part of the application process, Somsan submitted an essay. In it, he detailed the mental anguish he and his family suffered when he went blind.\n\nBut while he acknowledged that the struggles would be great, so would the joy and happiness at overcoming such adversity.\n\n\"Racing in Kona will allow me to heal and come back full circle in my journey of self discovery from darkness to light,\" Somsan wrote. \"Crossing the finish line in Kona represents more than just finishing a race, but will allow this athlete and his family to heal.\"\n\n'My success is their success'\n\nSomsan hasn't done this alone. Far from it. Seven volunteer athletes help him train during the week. When racing, he swims, bikes and runs with a guide. They're connected to each other with a cord for the swim and running portions, and the two ride a tandem bicycle.\n\n\"When you do an Ironman, I've learned to have an appreciation for the genuine actions of a lot of people, the people that support me,\" Somsan said. \"I think sometimes you forget about that. Any person that succeeds in life, whether it's an Ironman, whether it's your job or parenting, whatever it is you're struggling with and your goals are in life, there's people that support you.\n\n\"I don't think I could have gotten this far if I didn't have good people. ...These are just good people. I'm racing for them as well, not just for me. My success is their success.\"\n\nSomsan with Bernardo.\n\nDominic Bernardo agreed to be his guide for the race. He's run a full Ironman before, in Arizona back in 2013. Back then, he focused on just himself. Training for hours by yourself, Bernardo says, is \"mind-numbing.\" It's much different this time. Now he has someone to talk to while he's thinking -- and seeing -- for two.\n\n\"He has to have an immense amount of trust in me as a guide, but I think it's just like with any elite athlete, you have to have that rhythm, and so for us, we have to find that rhythm together,\" Bernardo said.\n\n\"We're the most efficient when we're running at the same cadence. We're pedaling at the same cadence but at the same pressure and smooth and efficiency. And the same thing in the water, taking our strokes at the same time. Any time that we can get in synch with one another, I think that that's when we have our best results, our best training days.\"\n\nThose training days together are long (the pair had a 105-mile bike ride scheduled for the morning after CNN's interview). And during the grind, it's not just a physical struggle but also a mental one. If one of them complains, that negativity can rub off on the other.\n\n\"I can't go forward without Dominic,\" Somsan said. \"Dominic can't go forward without me. We are constantly checking on each other. We have to.\"\n\nBernardo.\n\nSomsan also wants to make something clear. It upsets him when Bernardo is referred to as a guide. Somsan prefers something else: An athlete.\n\n\"In many ways, he's stronger than me, because he has to be,\" Somsan said. \"He's got to do double the work, in terms of, like, watching for obstacles. At the same time, I have to do the same thing. I have to keep up. I have to also make sure I protect him because if he gets hurt, I can't go forward.\"\n\nOver the course of nine months, Somsan and Bernardo have developed a great friendship training together. While Somsan will be completing this journey in front of his family, this experience hasn't just enriched him.\n\n\"I've learned a lot about myself,\" Bernardo said. \"I've learned a lot about life, I've learned a lot about him, and I've said many a time that he might be blind, but in so many ways he can see more clear that I can. And I really believe that. He's helped me in ways he probably will never know.\"\n\nComing home\n\nThe final stretch down Ali'i Drive has a landmark banyan tree, signaling that the Ironman finish is near.\n\n\"I'm even getting a little emotional now just thinking about it,\" Bernardo said. \"I can't wait to tell him here's the banyan tree and here's where we're at and just listening to the crowd and being able to describe (it).\n\nBike is checked-in and headed to Kona. Gracious to @TriBikeTransprt for the sponsorship! #roadtokona pic.twitter.com/7uFDevDD7Z \u2014 Michael Somsan (@BlindIronMan) September 18, 2016\n\n\"For him, it's a coming home. ...It's almost like (how) LeBron (James) went back to Cleveland and brought them a (NBA) championship. Michael's going back to Hawaii. He's going to do this and cross that finish line.\"\n\nSomsan's hope, as he wrote in his essay, is that his story will inspire others \"to never give up, and never be defeated by one's circumstances.\"\n\n\"We've been training really hard,\" Somsan said. \"This is -- I don't know -- it's almost like being an Olympian, when you go to the Olympics. It's that moment that you'll remember for the rest of your life.\"",

He has developed small nodules in the skin of his right leg, base of his neck and elsewhere. They are small tumors similar to the one that is in his head.

Ordinary investors in the new company, meanwhile, saw the value of their shares plunge to 17 cents from $35.50, while scores of contractors went unpaid for work on Mr. Trump\u2019s casinos and casino bondholders received pennies on the dollar.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe has a vast benefit from his destruction\u201d in the early 1990s, said one of the experts, Joel Rosenfeld, an assistant professor at New York University\u2019s Schack Institute of Real Estate. Mr. Rosenfeld offered this description of what he would advise a client who came to him with a tax return like Mr. Trump\u2019s: \u201cDo you realize you can create $916 million in income without paying a nickel in taxes?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump declined to comment on the documents. Instead, the campaign released a statement that neither challenged nor confirmed the $916 million loss.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThat being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cMr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it.\u201d\n\nSeparately, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Marc E. Kasowitz, emailed a letter to The Times arguing that publication of the records is illegal because Mr. Trump has not authorized the disclosure of any of his tax returns. Mr. Kasowitz threatened \u201cprompt initiation of appropriate legal action.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s refusal to make his tax returns public \u2014 breaking with decades of tradition in presidential contests \u2014 has emerged as a central issue in the campaign, with a majority of voters saying he should release them. Mr. Trump has declined to do so, and has said he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAt last Monday\u2019s presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton suggested Mr. Trump was refusing to release his tax returns so voters would not know \u201che\u2019s paid nothing in federal taxes,\u201d and when she also pointed out that Mr. Trump had once revealed to casino regulators that he paid no federal income taxes in the late 1970s, Mr. Trump retorted, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThe tax experts consulted by The Times said nothing in the 1995 documents suggested any wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, even if the extraordinary size of the loss he declared would have probably attracted extra scrutiny from I.R.S. examiners. \u201cThe I.R.S., when they see a negative $916 million, that has to pop out,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe documents examined by The Times represent a small fraction of the voluminous tax returns Mr. Trump would have filed in 1995.\n\nThe documents consisted of three pages from what appeared to be Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns. The pages were mailed last month to Susanne Craig, a reporter at The Times who has written about Mr. Trump\u2019s finances. The documents were the first page of a New York State resident income tax return, the first page of a New Jersey nonresident tax return and the first page of a Connecticut nonresident tax return. Each page bore the names and Social Security numbers of Mr. Trump and Marla Maples, his wife at the time. Only the New Jersey form had what appeared to be their signatures.\n\nThe three documents arrived by mail at The Times with a postmark indicating they had been sent from New York City. The return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Times presented the tax documents to Jack Mitnick, a lawyer and certified public accountant who handled Mr. Trump\u2019s tax matters for more than 30 years, until 1996. Mr. Mitnick was listed as the preparer on the New Jersey tax form.\n\nMr. Mitnick, 80, now semiretired and living in Florida, said that while he no longer had access to Mr. Trump\u2019s original returns, the documents appeared to be authentic copies of portions of Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns. Mr. Mitnick said the signature on the tax preparer line of the New Jersey tax form was his, and he readily explained an obvious anomaly in the way especially large numbers appeared on the New York tax document.\n\nA flaw in the tax software program he used at the time prevented him from being able to print a nine-figure loss on Mr. Trump\u2019s New York return, he said. So, for example, the loss of \u201c-915,729,293\u201d on Line 18 of the return printed out as \u201c5,729,293.\u201d As a result, Mr. Mitnick recalled, he had to use his typewriter to manually add the \u201c-91,\u201d thus explaining why the first two digits appeared to be in a different font and were slightly misaligned from the following seven digits.\n\n\u201cThis is legit,\u201d he said, stabbing a finger into the document.\n\nBecause the documents sent to The Times did not include any pages from Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 federal tax return, it is impossible to determine how much he may have donated to charity that year. The state documents do show, though, that Mr. Trump declined the opportunity to contribute to the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans\u2019 Memorial Fund, the New Jersey Wildlife Conservation Fund or the Children\u2019s Trust Fund. He also declined to contribute $1 toward public financing of New Jersey\u2019s elections for governor.\n\nThe tax documents also do not shed any light on Mr. Trump\u2019s claimed net worth of about $2 billion at that time. This is because the complex calculations of business deductions that produced a tax loss of $916 million are a separate matter from how Mr. Trump valued his assets, the tax experts said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNor does the $916 million loss suggest that Mr. Trump was insolvent or effectively bankrupt in 1995. The cash flow generated by his various businesses that year was more than enough to service his various debts.\n\nBut fragmentary as they are, the documents nonetheless provide new insight into Mr. Trump\u2019s finances, a subject of intense scrutiny given Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on his business record during the presidential campaign.\n\nBreaking News Alerts Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.\n\nToday\u2019s Headlines Wake up each morning to the day\u2019s top news, analysis and opinion delivered to your inbox.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe documents show, for example, that while Mr. Trump reported $7.4 million in interest income in 1995, he made only $6,108 in wages, salaries and tips. They also suggest Mr. Trump took full advantage of generous tax loopholes specifically available to commercial real estate developers to claim a $15.8 million loss in 1995 on his real estate holdings and partnerships.\n\nBut the most important revelation from the 1995 tax documents is just how much Mr. Trump may have benefited from a tax provision that is particularly prized by America\u2019s dynastic families, which, like the Trumps, hold their wealth inside byzantine networks of partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations.\n\nThe provision, known as net operating loss, or N.O.L., allows a dizzying array of deductions, business expenses, real estate depreciation, losses from the sale of business assets and even operating losses to flow from the balance sheets of those partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations onto the personal tax returns of men like Mr. Trump. In turn, those losses can be used to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income from, say, book royalties or branding deals.\n\nPhoto\n\nBetter still, if the losses are big enough, they can cancel out taxable income earned in other years. Under I.R.S. rules in 1995, net operating losses could be used to wipe out taxable income earned in the three years before and the 15 years after the loss. (The effect of net operating losses on state income taxes varies, depending on each state\u2019s tax regime.)\n\nThe tax experts consulted by The Times said the $916 million net operating loss declared by Mr. Trump in 1995 almost certainly included large net operating losses carried forward from the early 1990s, when most of Mr. Trump\u2019s key holdings were hemorrhaging money. Indeed, by 1990, his entire business empire was on the verge of collapse. In a few short years, he had amassed $3.4 billion in debt \u2014 personally guaranteeing $832 million of it \u2014 to assemble a portfolio that included three casinos and a hotel in Atlantic City, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, an airline and a huge yacht.\n\nReports that year by New Jersey casino regulators gave glimpses of the balance sheet carnage. The Trump Taj Mahal casino reported a $25.5 million net loss during its first six months of 1990; the Trump\u2019s Castle casino lost $43.5 million for the year. His airline, Trump Shuttle, lost $34.5 million during just the first six months of that year.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the organization is in dire financial straits,\u201d the casino regulators concluded.\n\nPhoto\n\nReports by New Jersey\u2019s casino regulators strongly suggested that Mr. Trump had claimed large net operating losses on his taxes in the early 1990s. Their reports, for example, revealed that Mr. Trump had carried forward net operating losses in both 1991 and 1993. What\u2019s more, the reports said the losses he claimed were large enough to virtually cancel out any taxes he might owe on the millions of dollars of debt that was being forgiven by his creditors. (The I.R.S. considers forgiven debt to be taxable income.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut crucially, the casino regulators redacted the precise size of the net operating losses in the public versions of their reports. Two former New Jersey officials, who were privy to the unredacted documents, could not recall the precise size of the numbers, but said they were substantial.\n\nPolitico, which previously reported that Mr. Trump most likely paid no income taxes in 1991 and 1993 based on the casino commission\u2019s description of his net operating losses, asked Mr. Trump to comment. \u201cWelcome to the real estate business,\u201d he replied in an email.\n\nNow, thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax records, the degree to which he spun all those years of red ink into tax write-off gold may finally be apparent.\n\nMr. Mitnick, the lawyer and accountant, was the person Mr. Trump leaned on most to do the spinning. Mr. Mitnick worked for a small Long Island accounting firm that specialized in handling tax issues for wealthy New York real estate families. He had long handled tax matters for Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, and he said he began doing Donald Trump\u2019s taxes after Mr. Trump turned 18.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mitnick said he could not divulge details of Mr. Trump\u2019s finances without Mr. Trump\u2019s consent. But he did talk about Mr. Trump\u2019s approaches to taxes, and he contrasted Fred Trump\u2019s attention to detail with what he described as Mr. Trump\u2019s brash and undisciplined style. He recalled, for example, that when Donald and Ivana Trump came in each year to sign their tax forms, it was almost always Ivana who asked more questions.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut if Mr. Trump lacked a sophisticated understanding of the tax code, and if he rarely showed any interest in the details behind various tax strategies, Mr. Mitnick said he clearly grasped the critical role taxes would play in helping him build wealth. \u201cHe knew we could use the tax code to protect him,\u201d Mr. Mitnick said.\n\nAccording to Mr. Mitnick, Mr. Trump\u2019s use of net operating losses was no different from that of his other wealthy clients. \u201cThis may have had a couple extra digits compared to someone else\u2019s operation, but they all benefited in the same way,\u201d he said, pointing to the $916 million loss on Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nIn \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d his 1987 best-selling book, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Mitnick as \u201cmy accountant\u201d \u2014 although he misspelled his name. Mr. Trump described consulting with Mr. Mitnick on the tax implications of deals he was contemplating and seeking his advice on how new federal tax regulations might affect real estate write-offs.\n\nMr. Mitnick, though, said there were times when even he, for all his years helping wealthy New Yorkers navigate the tax code, found it difficult to face the incongruity of his work for Mr. Trump. He felt keenly aware that Mr. Trump was living a life of unimaginable luxury thanks in part to Mr. Mitnick\u2019s ability to relieve him of the burden of paying taxes like everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHere the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,\u201d he said.",

Today, a spot in prestigious Aoyama Cemetery, in Tokyo, costs $100,000 , while even locker-style columbarium -- called nokotsudo -- can fetch $12,000 at a centrally located Buddhist temple.\n\nFurthermore, with single households in Japanese on the rise, reliance on an inherited burial site is less practical.\n\nThe Ruriden Byakurengedo columbarium , in Tokyo's famous shopping district of Shinjuku, is one high-tech alternative updated to suit modern life in Japan.\n\n\u7409\u7483\u6bbf\u524d\u306e\u51ac\u685c #\u6c38\u4ee3\u4f9b\u990a #\u7409\u7483\u6bbf #\u7d0d\u9aa8\u5802 #\u970a\u5712 #\u5893\u5730 #\u6771\u4eac #\u65b0\u5bbf #\u5c0f\u4eac\u90fd #\u685c A photo posted by \u65b0\u5bbf\u7409\u7483\u6bbf (@ruriden.jp) on Nov 27, 2015 at 5:59pm PST\n\nFrom the outside, Ruriden looks like a traditional Buddhist burial building with wooden doors and gracefully curving eaves.\n\nBut upon swiping an electronic pass card to enter, the doors swish open to unveil a dazzling display of 2,045 LED-lit Buddha statues. The relevant Buddha glows a different color, guiding each visitor to the niche that houses their loved one's remains.\n\nNot an incense stick or memorial plaque is in sight.\n\nAn electronic card allows the owner of the alter to access the Ruriden.\n\nA niche here costs $7,379, including maintenance, and can be used for 30 years before the remains are moved to a communal area under the building, to make way for incoming remains.\n\nFor many elderly without children, this removes the worry about maintenance of their niche, or passing it on to the next generation.\n\n\"Japan's population is declining due to a failing birthrate ... it is getting difficult to hand over the family grave to the next generation,\" Taijun Yajima, head priest of Kokokuji Buddhist Temple in Tokyo, which operates Ruriden, tells CNN.\n\nThe Shinjuku Rurikoin Byakurengedo\n\n\"But the tradition and sentiment towards the deceased has not changed even we though use high tech solutions. This columbarium just meets the needs of the times.\"\n\nThe Shinjuku Rurikoin Byakurengedo , in Tokyo, looks like a spaceship and acts like a smart library for ashes.\n\n\"The building doesn't feel anything like a crematorium,\" says Hikaru Suzuki, author of \"The Price of Death: The Funeral Industry in Contemporary Japan.\"\n\nWhen you swipe the card, a machine automatically fetches the relevant ashes from an underground vault and transports them across a conveyor belt system to the appropriate room.\n\nThe compact building holds tens of thousands of urns, and does not require an inheritor or maintenance by a family member.\n\nA sea of ideas\n\nIn Hong Kong, there is barely enough land for the living, let alone the dead.\n\nBurial sites, therefore, are impractical and 90% of the population opts for cremation.\n\nBut even ashes need a home, and reserving a niche in a public columbarium has become akin to winning the lottery, with thousands of families on waiting lists to secure a tiny square foot of space, according to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), which oversees these facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, a private columbarium niche can cost over $100,000.\n\nWith about 50,000 deaths a year in Hong Kong -- a city of 8 million people -- there will be a shortage of 400,000 niches by 2023, according to the FEHD.\n\nThe \"Floating Eternity\" is a sea-faring cemetery aimed at relieving pressure on the city's burial sites, and designed by local architectural firm Bread Studios.\n\n\"In Hong Kong, it's traditional to visit our ancestors' graves twice a year -- at Ching Ming Festival, in April, and Chung Yeung Festival, in October,\" says Paul Mui, design director at Bread Studio.\n\n\"It seems like a waste to reserve so much valuable land for places we only visit twice a year.\"\n\nPhotos: A cruise for cremains A floating cemetery in Hong Kong? \u2013 Floating cemeteries drifting along Hong Kong's coastline could be the solution to the country's lack of land space and aging population.

Hide Caption 4 of 4\n\nThe Floating Eternity, if built, would offer enough columbarium space to house the ashes of 370,000 people. The design incorporates cultural details, such as a positive feng shui design and bamboo gardens.\n\nLingering around the back of Hong Kong Island during off-season, the boat would dock in accessible spots for Ching Ming Festival, allowing relatives onboard to take part in traditional grave-sweeping activities.\n\nInfinity and beyond\n\nThe Elysium Space service is taking off-land burials one step further, by launching ashes into orbit.\n\nFor $1,990 each, 100 families per rocket launch can send a 1-gram capsule of ashes into space. The satellite containing the capsules typically orbits the Earth for several months before blazing back into the atmosphere, like a shooting star.\n\n\"Space is not just about technology, it is a beautiful landscape that can be used to create poetic celebrations,\" former NASA space system engineer Thomas Civeit, the founder of Elysium Space, tells CNN.\n\n\"Narratives about our souls traveling through the stars after we pass away already exist in Japan,\" explains Civeit, adding that about 50% of the US-based company's customers are Japanese.\n\nThe first launch departed from Kauai, Hawaii, in 2015, with another scheduled for this year.\n\nFamilies can use an app to track the orbiting satellite, and even see it with the naked eye, if wearing binoculars.\n\n\"New practices like these don't come out of the blue,\" says Suzuki, also an adviser for Elysium Space.\n\n\"The space burial is a culmination of technological possibilities and the younger generation's desire to write a new story about the afterlife journey.\"\n\nCNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report from Tokyo.",

Follow him @TheDeansreport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Samantha Bee really went after Jimmy Fallon this week for his Donald Trump interview. In truth, he treated the GOP presidential nominee like a Kardashian. It was jokes and cuteness to the max, with Fallon even begging for permission to mess up Trump's orangish hair. (After some manufactured coyness, Trump agreed.)\n\nIn general, late-night comedy hosts shouldn't be held responsible for vetting our presidential candidates. Just because a candidate appears on \"The Tonight Show,\" it doesn't somehow morph the program into \"Meet the Press.\" And if Fallon, whom I worked with for seven seasons at \"Saturday Night Live\" and is one of the nicest and most talented people you will ever meet, had been interviewing say a Mitt Romney or a John McCain, he could have given them a foot massage and most people wouldn't have cared.\n\nJUST WATCHED Seth Meyers talks Trump and Fallon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Seth Meyers talks Trump and Fallon 02:32\n\nBut Trump is different. And that is the very point Bee and others have raised. Trump, who literally kicked off his campaign spewing hate, has demonized Latino immigrants, demeaned an American-born federal judge for his Hispanic heritage, stoked hate against Muslims, despicably mocked a disabled reporter, made sexist remarks, led the racist birther campaign and even defended a black protester being beaten up by his white supporters.\n\nAnd it's no coincidence that Trump is proudly and publicly supported by a frightening number of white supremacists and anti-Semites such as David Duke. And while Trump will tell us he doesn't want their support, just a few weeks ago leading white supremacist leaders held a press conference to \"discuss their affection for Donald Trump and their hopes for a white homeland,\" which they demand must be free from Jews. (Trump has no problem calling people he doesn't like such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren a \"fraud\" and a \"racist\" but has yet to use such blunt and impassioned language to denounce his white supremacist fans.)\n\nIf Fallon were a person of color, a woman, a Muslim, disabled or a member of any group that Trump has demonized, you wonder if he would've given the candidate a free pass.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) To the untrained eye it's a simple piece of jewelry -- but don't let its modesty fool you.\n\nThis vivid, emerald green jadeite bangle is expected to sell for HK$50 million to HK$70 million ($6.5 to $9 million) when it goes under the hammer at a Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong in October.\n\nThis simple jadeite bangle is expected to fetch between HK$50 to $70 million ($6.5 to $9 million) when it goes under the hammer.\n\nJade is revered in China, with a cultural significance that dates back thousands of years and a value that was cemented by China's Qing dynasty emperors, who prized it for its purity.\n\nBut as China's rising wealth sees demand for jade jewelry grow, and supply out of Myanmar dwindles, prices for jade have risen exponentially, sparking a change in the styles preferred by Chinese buyers, and attracting a new group of Western admirers.\n\n\"With China opening up in the past decade, we have seen a new wave of collectors to the market. The auction market for jadeite has grown tremendously in the past 10 years,\" explains Chin Yeow Quek, the chairman of international jewelery at Sotheby's in Asia.\n\nFifty shades of jade\n\nThere's no denying the rising price of jade. Aside from million-dollar bangles, jade jewelry of the the right color and quality, from necklaces to earrings and pendants, has all been attracting serious money.\n\nThe most expensive piece of jade jewelry -- a necklace with a ruby and diamond clasp by Cartier that once belonged to the American heiress Barbara Hutton -- sold at a Sotheby's Hong Kong auction in April 2014 for $27.44 million, well above its $12.8 million estimate.\n\n\"It can be very crazy prices,\" says Chiang Shiu-Fung, an associate vice president and jewelry specialist with Christie's Asia, who quoted an old Chinese saying \"gold has a value; jade is invaluable.\"\n\nHowever, not all jade is equal, and being able to differentiate between types and qualities -- and being able to spot a fake -- is critical, if not always easy.\n\nJadeite, the purest, most translucent substance that comes in a multitude of colors, from deep greens to lavender, white, and black, is the hardest and most valuable form of the stone, and most often turned into jewelry.\n\nLesser quality nephrite, a softer, cloudier stone that comes in an even greater array of colors, is also classed as jade, but is more commonly used for carvings.\n\nLow quality industrial jade, and products made from cheaper-quality stone can also be treated by adding color or polymer to enhance the visual appeal of the stone to make it look like the real thing.\n\nEvery piece of jade is different and the most valuable form of the stone -- Jadeite -- lacks an international standard for grading, unlike diamonds and gemstones.\n\nAlthough most experts can tell the difference between these products with a visual assessment, it's not always reliable, and without any established international standard for guidance, even specialist jade experts can only be 80 to 90 percent sure whether a stone is pure jadeite using that method, according to Chiang.\n\n\"If you really want to be 100 percent sure that a piece is jadeite or some other kind of material, you have to send it to the laboratory,\" he says.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why Millennials buy diamonds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why Millennials buy diamonds 03:32\n\nEven if a product is found to be pure jade, any kind of adulteration or treatment significantly reduces the value of the stone, and Chiang says that only \"totally untreated, natural jadeite\" can be classified as an \"A-grade\" stone.\n\n\"In terms of the jewelry market, whatever gemstone it is, the natural one is the most desirable because it comes with natural beauty. Whatever humans can do artificially to improve the color, this kind of treatment lowers the value greatly.\"\n\nSupply-driven style\n\nWhen it comes to high-quality jadeite, growing demand among China's increasingly wealthy and middle classes have had a significant influence on rising prices.\n\nDwindling raw jade stocks in Myanmar, which supplies the vast majority of the world's jade and is the only source of high-quality stone, has also compounded the issue.\n\nJUST WATCHED The world's largest uncut diamond goes on sale Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The world's largest uncut diamond goes on sale 01:10\n\nAuction houses in Asia, where the vast majority of jade is sold, say this has led to a change in the styles of jade being sought among collectors, with a growing emphasis on quality factors like color and translucency.\n\n\"While we saw consecutive records set in 2013 and 2014, Chinese collectors these days are becoming more selective and are after pieces that are truly special and rare,\" says Sotheby's Chin.\n\n\"Nowadays people are looking for simple items in terms of the style,\" adds Chiang. \"People, especially jadeite collectors, are looking for the material, the quality of the stone.\"\n\nOn the retail end, the increased price and awareness of the stone has expanded the markets among Western buyers -- Nicole Kidman and Jessica Chastain among them -- and further segmented the market.\n\nActress Jessica Chastain shows off her jade earrings at the 2014 premiere of \"Interstellar\" in Hollywood, California.\n\nFrom a high-end retail perspective, personalization and uniqueness are the most important elements for customers according to Eddy Hui, the artistic director of Edward Chiu Jewellery Art in Hong Kong, who says that tastes differ between more traditional Asian customers and his growing Western clientele.\n\n\"Purchasing jadeite jewelry often comes with sentimental reason for general Chinese, and they pay attention to color and translucency. More Western clients are into fine workmanship, carving details, and they are crazy about originality,\" he says.\n\nChoosing wisely\n\nWhatever the preference or budget, jade's broad classification means it's important to choose a piece wisely, and Chiang says there are a few key things laypeople can look out for when purchasing.\n\nFirstly, the texture of the stone should be fine, as this enhances the stone's natural translucency, which is itself is another critical factor -- the more light that can be seen through a stone, the more lustrous and valuable it is.\n\nThe color, tone and translucency of jade are all critical factors in its valuation.\n\nThe color of the stone also significantly influences jadeite's value, and whether it's green, lavender or white, the color should be as pure as possible, with a strong saturation and a bright tone.\n\n\"Let's use green as an example: you have to go for straight green, purely green. When the green is a little bit bluish, forget about it,\" explains Chiang.\n\nFinally, bigger isn't necessarily best.\n\n\"If you have to choose between a large, commercial-quality stone and a small, better quality stone, go for the small one. We are buying a gemstone, we are not buying a brick. Large doesn't mean anything,\" says Chiang.\n\nBut technicalities aside, jewelry designer Hui says it's all a matter of choosing a reliable seller, and following your heart.\n\n\"Jade stones are like us: always unique,\" he says. \"Love at first sight is actually the best way to connect to your own piece. Like seeing Mr. Right, you know it when you feel it.\"",

    "text": "Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book , \"The Truth About Trump.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Like a football team that must shake off defeat in order to prepare for the next game, Donald Trump has a short time to get over his drubbing in the first presidential debate and get ready for the next. He has, instead, been whining like a kitchen blender about the moderator, the microphone and his opponent while continuing to draw attention to the worst parts of his performance.\n\nAdvisors who want Trump to win the next debate, on October 9, must get him to change. But to do this, they must overcome the candidate's 40-plus years of doing things his way. To appreciate the daunting nature of this task, consider just 10 things Trump could do to prepare for the next debate, and why it's likely he won't be able to do any of them.\n\n1) Accept your defeat in the first debate\n\nTrump likes to say \"I'm a winner\" and is not accustomed to losing, which may explain the poor sportsmanship he has shown since Hillary Clinton defeated him . Ignoring real poll results that show he was swamped, Trump has ordered aides to stop saying he lost. Of course, this kind of denial means that no one can ask the emperor to put on some clothes. He won't look down to see his own nakedness.\n\n2) Learn to apologize\n\nJUST WATCHED Christie may be considered to lead Trump debate prep Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Christie may be considered to lead Trump debate prep 01:56\n\nWhen he was asked in the first debate what he would say to African-Americans about his scandalous role in the \"birther\" controversy that questioned President Obama's citizenship, Trump replied , \"I say nothing.\" You will search in vain for an example of Trump ever taking responsibility for the damage he has done to any individual, community or nation, though examples abound. He is not going to learn how to do it now.\n\n3) Play by the rules\n\nManners may not count when you fire people on reality TV, but they matter in a two-way presidential debate. Trump looked like a 6-year-old as he interrupted with witticisms such as \"Wrong!\" as Clinton spoke during the first debate. But as Trump told me, he believes he is the same person he was in first grade. His advisers are not going to get him to mature into an adult now.\n\n4) Act like you want the job\n\nOne of the oddest moments in the first debate saw Trump say that if he loses the election he'll still get to Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington because he has a new hotel there. Someone who wants to occupy the White House shouldn't suggest he'd be satisfied with a hotel down the street. But Trump is first and always a salesman -- not a statesman -- and he will never pass up an opportunity to get free advertising for his business.\n\n5) Stop bragging\n\nDuring the first debate Trump's cringe-worthy moments included bragging about not paying any federal taxes and about betting on a housing crisis. As he crowed about his wealth, he added that he was speaking \"not in a braggadocious way.\" But of course he was bragging. Boasting and bragging are off-putting to debate watchers but they are essential elements of Trump's personality and he will not stop.\n\n6) Don't make so many faces\n\nOn the day after the first debate, body language experts noted Trump's negative body language and timid facial expression. (These signals were enough for one reporter to call Trump the loser after viewing the contest with the sound turned off.) Advisers may want Trump to control his exaggerated nonverbals, but this is not something this rubber-faced man can do.\n\n7) Prepare and practice\n\nAlways ready to use a little gamesmanship, Trump allowed his campaign staff to broadcast the fact that he was taking a confidently casual approach to the first debate. He said himself, \"I believe you can prep too much for these things.\" The result was obvious, as Trump seemed ill-equipped with either arguments or rhetorical parries to use against his opponent. Could he do differently? Trump told me that he doesn't like to read and prefers to depend on instinct, which makes it's hard to imagine he will suddenly become open to training. Another person might turn a debate defeat as a moment to learn. This is not Trump's way.\n\n8) Update your references\n\nIn the first debate Trump referenced Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who died in 1964, to make a point about America's pursuit of the ISIS terror organization. Those who got As in history, know of MacArthur, but the reference surely bypassed millions who watched the debate. Trump must have heard a lot about the general when he attended a military school in the 1960s, but he needs to update himself. Given the evidence that he doesn't understand the workings of our most vital technology, the internet, modernizing his knowledge base would be a big challenge.\n\n9) Abandon the Russians\n\nDespite the evidence showing that recent cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee and others emanated from Russia, Trump told the first debate audience, \"She's [Clinton] saying 'Russia, Russia, Russia,' but I don't.\" This stand is consistent with Trump's earlier sloughing off of Russia's invasion of the Ukraine and his expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin. Because everything is personal for him, Trump likes Putin in part because Putin has said he likes him. Don't expect him to change his mind about the Russians on the basis of geopolitics. They are going to have to insult him personally before he does that.\n\n10) Be nicer\n\nIn the first debate, Clinton pointed out his penchant for insulting people and Trump talked about \"somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\" After the debate, Trump decided to make veiled threats about using President Bill Clinton's sex scandal against her. Nastiness doesn't play well in a general election when a candidate must appeal to those beyond his or her base. However being nasty has always been a key element of Trump's repertoire, as shown by his feuds with Cher, Bette Midler, Rosie O'Donnell and others. Trump once told me that he doesn't respect most people because they don't deserve it. He is not likely to become respectful overnight.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAmong Trump's advisers there is one, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who shares much in common with him. Like Trump, he poses as a tough man and wants the world to believe that his meanness is a virtue. He is also, like his candidate, a thrice-married man who feels entitled to criticize Hillary Clinton's lifelong marriage.\n\nConsider Giuliani's persona and you see someone who understands Trump on a gut level.",

Last week, Duterte said this round of joint drills with the US would be the last.\n\n\"I serve notice to you now that this will be the last joint military exercise with US,\" Duterte said\n\n'I will break up with America'\n\nDurterte's verbal tirade against the US heated up after widespread criticism of his anti-drug campaign.\n\nThousands of suspected drug dealers and users have died during Duterte's aggressive crackdown on the illegal drug trade.\n\nSome were killed during shootouts with local police when suspects allegedly resisted arrest. Others died in nightly vigilante-style killings, where bodies are left on the streets with cardboard signs describing their alleged drug-related crimes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Duterte said he's willing to cut ties with the US in favor of Russia and China.\n\n\"Respect is important,\" he said in one of three speeches Tuesday. \"If this is what happens now, I will be reconfiguring my foreign policy. Eventually I might, in my time, I will break up with America.

    "text": "After eight and a half months in jail, Ammon Bundy, the leader of the occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, finally took the stand in federal court late Tuesday.\n\nBundy took the stand in his trial after several delays, and his lawyer\u2019s goal seemed to be to illustrate Bundy\u2019s motives and state of mind during the occupation, with the jury hearing from a man who feels that his family and the ranchers in Burns have been abused by the government.\n\nBundy took the stand wearing blue scrubs and a jail t-shirt with a copy of the Constitution in his breast pocket.\n\nHe described growing up on a ranch in Nevada, starting his own fleet maintenance business and his lawyer showed the jury a photo of Bundy\u2019s wife Lisa and their six children.\n\nBundy said he became an activist after a standoff at his father Cliven Bundy\u2019s ranch in Nevada in 2014.\n\nThe rancher claims the issue started when BLM workers began to confiscate the family\u2019s cattle for illegal grazing on federal land, leading hundreds of people to travel there to protest.\n\nIn a video from that 2014 standoff shown in court Tuesday, Bundy was shocked with a stun gun three times when he confronted police and government vehicles.\n\n\u201cThere was a tremendous amount of abuse that came upon my family about these grazing rights,\u201d Bundy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned in great depths what it means to hold onto those rights. It\u2019s our heritage.\u201d\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Bundy said his father told him about Dwight and Steven Hammond, ranchers in Burns, Oregon, convicted of arson on federal land.\n\nOn the stand, Bundy got choked up and paused several times, recalling a conversation with his father about the Hammonds.\n\n\u201c\u2019I\u2019m afraid that what\u2019s happening to them is the same thing that happened to us,\u201d he testified. \u201cI said, \u2018Dad, I can\u2019t fight another battle. We\u2019re doing the best we can to keep our family from going to prison.\u2019 I told him I couldn\u2019t get involved.\u201d\n\nThe next day, though, Bundy said read up on the Hammonds\u2019 case and he said he felt compelled to drive to Burns. He went to the Hammonds\u2019 ranch and said Steven was broken, defeated and done fighting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe, this overwhelming feeling that it was my duty to get involved and protect this family,\u201d Bundy testified.\n\nFour other witnesses testified during morning sessions of the trial, two of whom were Burns residents sympathetic to the occupiers and their views, and who both separately visited the refuge during the occupation.\n\nThese two witnesses said there was nothing threatening about their visits to the occupiers at the refuge, testimony seemingly meant to demonstrate the defense\u2019s case that while the occupiers had firearms, they weren't pointing them in a threatening way.\n\nThat argument ties to the defense's assertions that federal workers could have gone to work at the refuge during the occupation if they'd wanted to and that the occupiers did not intimidate, threaten or force the federal refuge workers from coming to work.\n\nThe government contends that the seven people on trial did just that, though, keeping workers from their jobs through the use of threats and intimidation, in part because of the firearms the occupiers had at the refuge.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.

    "text": "Brian C. Bush is a contributor to theGrio.com and works for the Tennessee Journal of Race, Gender, & Social Justice . Follow him on Twitter @BrianCB. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) Music's first family, Mr. and Mrs. Shawn \"Jay Z\" Carter \u2014 that is Jay Z and Beyonce -- have been on quite the philanthropic streak, blurring the distinction between entertainer and saint.\n\nThe generosity has even extended abroad. Just recently, Beyonc\u00e9 paid a visit to Haiti to meet with citizens affected by the devastating 2010 earthquake. Photos from the trip show the singer smiling as she poses with aid workers, tours communities and passes out coloring books to children in the capital city of Port-au-Prince.\n\nIn short, the hardest working couple in show business has certainly focused their recent efforts toward giving back.\n\nBut while my initial reaction as a fan is to applaud the gestures as admirable acts of charity by collective billionaires, the cynic within me wonders about the timing: Is the recent string of social activism genuine? Or is it merely an attempt to buoy Jay-Z's struggling music streaming service, Tidal, in hopes that pouring largesse into the public will produce Tidal-faithful in the future?\n\nTo be sure, we can't know what's in the couple's heart, but by now, Tidal's troubles are fairly well-known. The subscription-only service has produced little more than a resounding thud since its March launch.\n\nOnly two weeks after finding a spot in the U.S. iPhone \"top 20 downloads\" chart, Tidal plummeted out of the top 700 rankings, rising recently to a current ranking of 36th overall -- still 24 spots behind its chief competitor, Spotify.\n\nI'm as shocked as anyone to discover that whatever the duo touches doesn't immediately turn to gold, but it's exactly the company's struggles that make the pairing's altruism look all the more suspect.\n\nJUST WATCHED Beyonce and Jay Z reveal private moments Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Beyonce and Jay Z reveal private moments 01:42\n\nTwo reasons: The first is that over the years, Jay Z has been accused by many of being averse to stepping in on social issues, most notably in a slam by civil rights icon Harry Belafonte.\n\nDuring a 2012 interview, Belafonte took aim at Carter, accusing the entertainer of not embracing his role as a social leader, saying, \"... I think one of the great abuses of this modern time is that we should have had such high-profile artists, powerful celebrities. But they have turned their back on social responsibility. That goes for Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, for example. Give me Bruce Springsteen, and now you're talking. I really think he is black.\"\n\nResponding to the slight, Jay Z clumsily said, among other things, that, \"I'm offended by that because first of all, and this is going to sound arrogant, but my presence is charity. Just who I am. Just like Obama's is. Obama provides hope.\"\n\nCarter's phrasing was pretentious, yes, but I happen to think both of them could have made their points more respectfully. Still, I agree with Belafonte -- in part.\n\nCarter doesn't fully embrace his role as a social leader; few men of his stature do. Instead, like skilled boxers or seasoned politicians, men like Carter tend to only engage themselves in situations that stand to produce personal success.\n\nThat would translate into only assuming a role as an \"activist\" when doing so is a politically safe move that doesn't threaten the bottom line (and hopefully improves it). Few people in history have crept up on a billion-dolla r fortune by alienating parts of their consumer base.\n\nThe second cause for doubt was the widespread public criticism of Tidal's launch event , a nauseating display consisting of upwards of 10 millionaires standing on stage declaring, essentially, that they just aren't paid enough.\n\nSo what's the best way to change the public's perception of a company that seems solely designed to help the rich become richer? Give back to the community. Who can rightly gripe when the chief is doing such good in the communities with the money he's amassed over the years?\n\nThis isn't to say that Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 haven't been charitable before \u2014 Jay Z runs a scholarship fund, the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation , for example. And last December he was partly responsible for printing the \"I Can't Breathe\" T-shirts worn by NBA players in protest of the killing of Eric Garner.\n\nIt would be nice to think that it's all authentic-- that Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 have reached a level of success that allows them to take bold stances without the fear of repercussions.\n\nRealistically, though, I can't doubt the business acumen and foresight of a man who went from Brooklyn's Marcy Projects to being a regular guest and friend of the President. Let's hope we see more of this new generosity, no matter how Tidal fares.\n\nAt least the couple is doing something, right?",

Russian officials and athletes likened the move to Cold War era conflicts.\n\nAnd while Reedie remains adamant there has been no involvement from the Russian government, he says the hack could have serious consequences for the country's bid to re-enter the world of athletics.\n\nCraig Reedie is the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if the Russian government was directly involved,\" said Reedie.\n\n\"However, the information that we have, which I'm pretty certain is authoritative, is that the people who are doing this have connections to Russia.\n\n\"I would hope that the appeals I have made to my colleagues and officials in Russia will bring about some desired results because this continued breach of confidentiality on athletes' personal records is entirely unwelcome.\n\n\"It is dangerous, it breaches every bit of medical code that I would ever know, and is unhelpful if Russia is making efforts to have its anti-doping system declared compliant.\"\n\nRussian sports minister Vitaly Mutko denied accusations of governmental interference when he spoke to reporters in Athens, Wednesday.\n\n\"How can one possibly prove that the hackers were from Russia?\" Mutko said, according to state-run Tass news agency.\n\nSerena and Venus Williams both had their medical records hacked.\n\n\"Nowadays, Russia is blamed for everything and it seems to be in the trend.\n\n\"I want to say that we have no such information and we are also deeply concerned since the hacked documents could have also contained information on Russian athletes and it could be made public as well.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Russia hackers steal medical data of Rio athletes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Russia hackers steal medical data of Rio athletes 02:20\n\nThe hack, which revealed therapeutic exemption use (TUE) details of stars such as American four-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles as well as tennis sisters Venus and Serena Williams, has led to criticism of WADA's security systems.\n\nA TUE allows an athlete to use, for therapeutic purposes only, an otherwise prohibited substance or method.\n\nThey're often used because athletes may have illnesses or conditions which means they need to take certain medications.\n\nSimone Biles was one of the stars at Rio 2016.\n\nIf the medication which is needed is listed as a prohibited substance, a TUE could be given to allow the athlete to use the medication without breaking any doping laws.\n\nExemptions, which are only granted if WADA determines no unfair advantage is given to the athlete, can be applied for through the athletes' national anti-doping agency or international federation.\n\nThe entire process is supposed to be kept confidential to maintain the athlete's right to privacy.\n\nReedie, who revealed that the organization has a budget of $30 million to spend on its security, says WADA will meet in Switzerland on Tuesday to discuss what should be done to safeguard its system in the future.\n\nJUST WATCHED Russia banned from Paralympic Games after appeal denied Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Russia banned from Paralympic Games after appeal denied 01:22\n\n\"We have been in business now and moved mountains -- people should understand that -- over the past 17 years,\" he said.\n\n\"What we need to do is make sure our own processes are up to date and are efficient for the world in 2016 instead of 1999 and we will do that.\n\n\"Next week we're looking at whether the code can be changed to cover institutionalized corruption. We are looking at whether we should have more powers when we declare people non-compliant.\n\nPhotos: Sebastian Coe says athetics \"is about a great deal more than doping,\" adding: \"We've chased some of the biggest names out of the sport, and that doesn't come without a cost.\" Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: But track and field athletics has come under scrutiny after fresh claims of widespread doping at major championships. Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: The Sunday Times and German broadcaster ARD have accused the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) of failing to investigate hundreds of \"suspicious\" drug tests between 2001 and 2012. Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: The reports said 800 of the 12,000 blood tests involving 5,000 athletes were suspicious. Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: The IAAF has denied athletics is suffering a similar crisis to cycling's past history of doping when that sport was bedeviled by extensive drug-taking and accusations of top-level cover-ups.\n\nHide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: Coe -- twice Olympic 1,500 meter champion -- insists the organization has led the way on out-of-competition independent testing. Hide Caption 6 of 9 Photos: Former pole vaulter Sergey Bubka, who is standing against Coe in August to become the next IAAF president, says athletics \"must be more proactive and even more transparent in our aggressive pursuit of a zero tolerance policy against doping cheats.\" Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach has promised the organization will pursue a policy of \"zero tolerance\" if allegations of widespread doping by track and field athletes at the Olympics are proven. Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: This isn't the first time that athletics has faced questions over doping. Ben Johnson stunned the world by taking 100m gold in a record time in South Korea at the 1988 Olympics, but the Canadian left the Olympic movement in turmoil when he later tested positive for a banned substance. Hide Caption 9 of 9\n\n\"We're looking at our own governance. We're taking this seriously, It's easy to criticize, it's easy to look back, we now have to look forward and that's precisely what we're doing.\"",

Afghans will do well if they believe they have got the kind of strategic partnership that President Obama offered them in 2009 when he explicitly said, we will be your strategic partner. You can't put a number on that. It's not a specific number of Americans planes or boots on the ground.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nJIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Welcome back. I am Jim Sciutto in Washington. General Stanley McChrystal is four star general and commander of American forces - coalition forces in Afghanistan. He was - he's credited with transforming the U.S. forces into the elite fighting force they are today. He is author of a new book \"Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World.\" And it is certainly a very complex world.\n\nGeneral McChrystal, thanks very much for joining us. Had the pleasure of seeing you when you were commander in Afghanistan. You've been travelling around the country a little bit so it's nice to see you out of the uniform.\n\nGEN. STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, U.S. ARMY (RET.): It's great to be here. Thanks.\n\nSCIUTTO: I want to begin with the case of Bowe Bergdahl, Taliban Five because today that deal is expiring and we are still waiting here what the next step will be. But first I want to ask you about Sergeant Bergdahl.\n\nYou were commander when he was taken. Were you a deserter?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I've been in command for about a month and when he left his base we didn't know. We had reason to believe he walked off his base but he could have been a confused young man, and that may still be the ruling, I am not sure. So, we made every effort we could like we would for your son or daughter to try to recover him as fast as we could.\n\nSCIUTTO: Now, if it was discovered at the time, and I know that the questions - the details were certainly murky then and to some degree there are still questions today, but if he was a deserter, would that change at all U.S. efforts to rescue him?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: It's hard to make that kind of judgment because it would have been impossible to know at the moment if he was a deserter. We were trying to prevent him from being taken into Pakistan where we thought he would fall into the hands of Haqqani for two reasons. One, because he's an American citizen and one of ours, a comrade. And second, because he would then become a chip in the power gain there, and we were concerned about both of those.\n\nSCIUTTO: Do you have any concerns about the deal that was made a year ago to trade these five senior Taliban leaders for his freedom?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I think if you look going forward getting back an American soldier was important particularly until he is adjudicated it impossible to say what was the cause. So, it was important to get him back. I think now we've got to move forward. We got to decide what we deal with. The five that are back - presumably, they will go back to the battlefield but they won't change the dynamics. It's not going to change the balance of effort there, five guys, but it's just something we are - watch as we go forward.\n\nSCIUTTO: But that's an enormous concern. You say presumably they will go back to the fight, first of all that's an alarming assumption. And yes, there are a number of members of Taliban who won't change but they are quite senior in the organization. Would that not be a loss? Would that not put U.S. forces in danger there?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: I wouldn't make it too important. They were in captivity quite awhile. They're not going to go back, I think, to a key operational role. I say presume, because you have to assume to worst case in a case like this. We can't have assumed to have changed their thinking in a time they were in our captivity, I mean, anymore than we would want an American who had been held by the enemy to change his thinking. So, I think we have to presume that their bonds with their old organization are probably going to be pretty strong and just go from there.\n\nSCIUTTO: And if they do go back, that deal you still think was a good deal to gain his freedom?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: It's hard to make a judgment on a deal like that. It's an American soldier and so getting him back to me is a pretty sacred responsibility.\n\nSCIUTTO: I want to ask you about Iraq. The fight against ISIS is not going well. The map really immutable for the last several months despite a massive U.S.-led air campaign and a massive advantage among the Iraqi and Kurdish forces aligned against the forces of ISIS. You have been very public in saying you need U.S. forces - boots on the ground to fight this fight and win. Is that what is necessary to turn this around?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: Well, what I have actually said is we first need a very clear strategy to deal with ISIS and to establish a framework for the region. Because if we don't have a direction of where we are going, where the instate will be, the just defeating ISIS will just be a sort of a meaningless act.\n\nSecond, we have got to recognize what ISIS is, and it's a phenomenon of the 21st century. It's based on some age-old ideas but as you and I both know is they are operating in a way that is disorienting to organizations of the region. They've got this incredible tactical ability to combine suicide bombers with pretty flexible tactics on the ground and this superb information warfare campaign. It's very decentralized. It makes us all worry about what they are doing.\n\nI think we are going to have to show leadership in the region. I think American presence and leadership is going to be critical to build a team of teams against ISIS.\n\nSCIUTTO: To demonstrate leadership do you have to commit American forces on the ground?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: I think you have got to demonstrate American revolve and leadership. In some cases it could be Americans on the ground with Iraqi forces helping leverage as you know one (INAUDIBLE) army in a difficult time like the Iraqi army is needs that feel of the cloth of comrades. And I think Americans can be a big part of that, but I don't think thousands and thousands of American forces on the ground to be ground forces (INAUDIBLE) would do that is probably the right move right now.\n\nSCIUTTO: So, you mean - and this is something that General Dempsey and others have raised, the idea of forward deployed advisers. So, in other words military advisers instead of back in the base, they are on the forward lines or forward ground controllers. Is that what you're talking about?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: Yes, it is. Because war is about confidence.\n\nIf you know when the Iraqis pulled out of Ramadi, it was a military calculus, but in reality it was much more a loss of confidence. Sometimes just the presence of American advisers with their connection to air power and whatnot can bolster the confidence of leaders and provide additional advice as well.\n\nSCIUTTO: And confidence seems to be key because you here this - the words of Secretary Ash Carter saying, they didn't have the will to fight.\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: Confidence is everything at every level. It starts having confidence in your leaders all the way up to your national leaders and then in yourselves. And I think that's something we could potentially help with.\n\nSCIUTTO: I want to ask you about Afghanistan because this was meant to be the year of the end of the U.S. Military presence in Afghanistan.\n\nThe president has extended the smaller force that is there for a bit of a longer period of time. But the reporting on the ground is that those forces are doing more kinetic activity than the president had described. Initially he said, well, they will protect U.S. forces for its protection et cetera but there is evidence that they are doing offensive operations, going after Taliban leaders. Is this a stealth extension of the U.S. war in Afghanistan?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: I think it is just a recognition that we can get a balance.\n\nMost of the fighting on the ground is being done by Afghan police and military and they are bearing most the casualties. I think America brings some very specific capabilities to do precision operations with Afghan partners in many cases. But I think it goes back to confidence as well.\n\nAfghans will do well if they believe they have got the kind of strategic partnership that President Obama offered them in 2009 when he explicitly said, we will be your strategic partner. You can't put a number on that. It's not a specific number of Americans planes or boots on the ground. It's the sense that we are an absolutely committed friend that will help them protect their sovereignty.\n\nSCIUTTO: But that sounds like a long commitment. And I'm harkening back a number of years.\n\nI remember you said to me when we were in Kabul, and this is a good five years ago, you made the comparison to U.S. troops in Germany and Korea, they of course been there for decades. That that kind of commitment is not unusual when you are facing an enemy, in this case like the Taliban. Are you saying that you need an American force presence in Afghanistan for years and years to come to give that confidence?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I think you make that calculus. I think both Japan and Germany turned out pretty well and they could have turned out very differently. And so, I think, that if you look in the long sweep, wars don't have a set beginning and set end. As you know, all the things you do that lead up to a war and of course more importantly after a war prevents the next one.\n\nSo I think, if we look at our policy as a long continuum, and not being in a hurry and say, we may have people there for a long time. But in reality it's cheaper than doing spasmodic moves of big forces into (INAUDIBLE).\n\nSCIUTTO: Finally, as you write this book about leadership, you have got a very strong reputation, of course, from your commands in Afghanistan. There are some who talk about you as a future political candidate. Do you plan or have any ideas or thoughts or ambitions to run for office?\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: No, Jim. I really want young people - qualified young people. I'd like to see more young veterans going in but I have zero intent.\n\nSCIUTTO: A lot of politicians who've said that and then changed their minds.\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: No, let me be - let me be. I am not going to run for any office, period.\n\nSCIUTTO: OK. General McChrystal, thanks very much for joining us today.\n\nMCCHRYSTAL: Jim, thanks so much.\n\nEND INTERVIEW",

    "text": "Wow, so it looks like we have a budget deal in Washington. A debt ceiling and spending crisis has been averted. It\u2019s good news. But let\u2019s all calm down. It\u2019s only temporary. The agreement does not address the long-term fiscal problems we have. Problems that were mostly created by none other than the \u201cbaby boomer\u201d generation. Yeah, you know who you are.\n\nYou\u2019re tanned and healthy and living way past average life expectancy. You\u2019ve got a defined benefit pension plan from a large company or government that was created years ago when people didn\u2019t understand how horribly these plans can go wrong and now can\u2019t afford to meet its liabilities, but you don\u2019t care as long as you get your check which you don\u2019t really need anyway. And your social security check. And your Medicare reimbursement check. You once hated the government. You smoked pot and protested against Vietnam and President Nixon. That was a long, long time ago.\n\nLife has been good for you. You\u2019re a baby boomer. You were born between 1946 and the early 1960\u2019s. You had Woodstock and the Stones in the \u201960s, discos and coke in the \u201970s, Wall Street in the \u201980s, Bill Clinton in the \u201990s and now you\u2019re retiring to Arizona and Florida on the backs of your stressed-out kids whose own children stay at home with them into their 20s because they have no jobs. Tom Brokaw once wrote a book about the greatest generation, those brave people who survived the depression and fought in World War II. Unfortunately that great generation spawned a generation of narcissists: the baby boomers.\n\nThe boomers have created liabilities that will take generations to pay off. Our national debt is now at around $17 trillion, larger for the first time in recent history than the size of our entire economy. And it\u2019s projected to continue to significantly grow over the next few decades unless something dramatic is done to reduce it. Boomers don\u2019t like to talk about fiscal responsibility or living within their means. They like their credit cards and government secured mortgages on overvalued properties. They enjoy their malls and their cars and their houses and as long as someone\u2019s willing to lend them the money to buy this stuff they don\u2019t seem to care much about how it will be one day paid. They still represent an enormous voting block and have no intention to have this lifestyle threatened. This is the real reason Washington can\u2019t create a long-term deficit reduction plan. The boomers love their safety nets.\n\nThese safety nets were created over the past few decades by boomers and for boomers, with little regard to the future. One of the major reasons our national debt is so high is because 40 percent of our government\u2019s spending goes to some type of insurance: social insurance, retirement, health benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. These systems are bankrupt. But they\u2019re needed to pay for the boomers\u2019 healthcare and pension plans. People that were born after 1965 are working hard to make sure that the boomer generation gets their retirement and disability paid for by the government. But it\u2019s still not enough. So our government has to borrow and print money. And our debts balloon. Who will pay these debts? Ah, who cares says the boomers. Not my problem.\n\nThey are the source of one of the biggest problems with Obamacare. Whether you support the Affordable Care Act or not (and I think there are lots of great things about it), one undeniable fact is that the cost of this new system is being put squarely on the shoulders of the young. People in their 20s need less health care than the boomers in their 60s and 70s. This is not only because younger people today have healthier lifestyles but because many boomers spent most of their young lives smoking, drinking sugary sodas and engaging in risky, unprotected sex. There are 34 million mostly young and uninsured people who will be required on January 1, 2014, to pay for health insurance just so the boomers can take advantage of the added benefits that health insurance companies have to now legally provide.\n\nThey are, thank God, the last reminders of our racist, homophobic, sexist past. When you look at those \u201cwhite only\u201d diners and drinking fountains in those photos from the 1960s you just can\u2019t believe it. Or how women were treated. And gays. But many of our beloved boomers were teenagers back then, living with parents who watched Ozzie and Harriet and were raised to believe that people who weren\u2019t white weren\u2019t to be trusted, women were meant to stay at home, and gays were sinners. Over time, these attitudes have changed, mainly because people in their 20s and 30s are smarter, better educated and more open-minded. Unfortunately, and although we now have a black President, the last remnants of the boomer generation who still wield power in their churches and companies are doing their best to keep women out of the corporate suite, protest against gay marriage and fight immigration reform.\n\nWe\u2019re scrambling to fix the environment because of their excesses. For years, and despite warnings, the boomers refused to recycle and ran companies that spewed ozone-destroying chemicals into the air. There are countless plots of land that are unusable because of chemicals and pesticides dumped by this generation. I\u2019m no environmentalist, but even I have to shake my head at the destruction laid upon the planet over the past 40 years alone: decimated forests, extinct species, smog filled skies, islands of plastic floating in the ocean. Only recently are steps being taken by younger generations to attempt to reverse this trend.\n\nThe good news is that the baby boomer generation is quickly getting older. Ten thousand boomers are retiring each day. We can\u2019t ship them all off to an island, unfortunately. But I\u2019m optimistic that the next generation of leaders will not make the same mistakes. Governments will take care of people who are truly needy \u2014 not just because they turned 65 and have a car payment \u2014 and this will help fix our deficit problems. Racism will continue to decline as the world becomes smaller and more social. Our environment will improve because kids in elementary school are being taught to care about the planet. Ultimately, these generations will fix the problems that the boomers created. And we can soon bid farewell to that horrible generation.\n\nFollow @GeneMarks on Twitter.",

    "text": "Megyn Kelly and Sean Hannity, who have back-to-back shows on Fox News, have a sharp difference of opinion about Donald Trump.\n\nThe disagreement spilled into the open on Wednesday night when Kelly pointed out Trump's decision to stick with pro-Trump interviewers like Hannity.\n\nKelly's observation was accurate and straightforward -- Trump has been avoiding all but the friendliest of interview forums. But Hannity shot back with a tweet to her, saying, \"u should be mad at @HillaryClinton. Clearly you support her.\"\n\nKelly prides herself on her independence, so Hannity's blunt accusation that she is a Hillary Clinton supporter shocked some observers of the Twitter tiff.\n\nKelly chose not to reply to Hannity.\n\nWhile intramural cable news feuds happen from time to time, this one involves two of Fox's best-known and best-paid hosts.\n\nKelly's contract is due to expire in mid-2017 and Fox's owners, the Murdochs, are keen to keep her at the network. Hannity's contract extends through 2020.\n\nA Fox News spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday night.\n\nWhen asked by CNNMoney to elaborate on his tweet, Hannity replied with a blank email.\n\nKelly, a take-no-prisoners journalist, and Hannity, and a devoted conservative commentator, embody two co-existing but competitive versions of Fox News.\n\nThe two prime time hosts have had a cordial relationship in the past, which makes Wednesday's insulting tweet from Hannity all the more intriguing.\n\nHannity finished his tweet by saying, \"@realDonaldTrump did talk to u.\"\n\n@megynkelly u should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to u. https://t.co/vsQiNMgHut \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 6, 2016\n\nIndeed, Kelly interviewed Trump in May, burying the hatchet after Trump targeted her for criticism for the better part of a year.\n\nSince then, however, Trump has declined Kelly's interview requests. In recent months the GOP nominee has avoided most other TV journalists, preferring to speak with a select group of Fox News interviewers who have opinion shows on the channel.\n\nHannity, Bill O'Reilly and the co-hosts of \"Fox & Friends\" are in this group.\n\nRelated: Trump's appeal to Hannity highlights his conservative media bubble\n\nAs a result, there's a divide within Fox News, between the Trump-friendly interviewers and the other hosts and journalists he declines to talk with.\n\nKelly's point, on Wednesday's edition of her 9 p.m. show \"The Kelly File,\" was that this media strategy may backfire on Trump. Political and media analysts have made similar arguments recently.\n\n\"Donald Trump, with all due respect to my friend at 10, will go on Hannity, and pretty much only Hannity, and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days, which doesn't exactly expand the tent,\" Kelly said.\n\nAs Mediaite reported right after it happened, Kelly also called out Clinton for limiting her TV interviews. She specifically mentioned a Clinton appearance on \"The Steve Harvey Show\" that was partly scripted by the daytime talk show's producers. The Washington Free Beacon obtained a memo about the interview production and wrote about it on Wednesday.\n\nKelly has been lobbying for an interview with Clinton all year long.\n\nKelly's comments on Wednesday came in the context of an interview with Stuart Stevens, a top strategist on Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign.\n\nStevens told CNNMoney in August that Trump's regular appearances on shows like Hannity were akin to \"driving in loops around a cul de sac\" because \"he's selling to the people who have already bought the product.\"\n\nStevens pointed out that Trump was \"only doing friendly voices on Fox,\" adding, \"He's not sitting down with Megyn Kelly, other than that one time in May. He's not sitting down with Chris Wallace. It's just a comfort zone. It's what he has done during the whole campaign -- he's doing what is comfortable.\"\n\nRelated: Fox News note commenting on Jesse Watters' controversial Chinatown segment\n\nHannity had the first televised conversation with Trump after the first Trump-Clinton debate last week. On Wednesday night, Hannity talked with Trump's running mate Mike Pence.",

    "text": "(CNN) The Sudanese government has been accused of using chemical weapons against the people of Darfur, according to a report released by Amnesty International on Thursday.\n\nThe attacks targeted civilians and may constitute a war crime, the report said. The Sudanese government has denied the allegations, calling them \"rumors.\"\n\nAmnesty says it has new evidence abuses persist in a war that has been described as one of the world's worst humanitarian conflicts by the United Nations.\n\nUnidentified witnesses quoted in the Amnesty report said the attacks left a smoke, which turned dark blue and smelled \"like rotten eggs,\" coating the trees, ground, and humans in a thick black dust.\n\nWitness testimony\n\nAfter exposure to the smoke, some said their skin turned white and became rotten or hardened and fell off in chunks.\n\n\"When the bomb exploded I inhaled the poisonous air which I am still smelling even now,\" said one witness.\n\nSome children vomited blood, the report said. Another witness said: \"My youngest child was walking before the attack. Now she is only crawling.\"\n\nPictures obtained by Amnesty International show graphic images of children with large welts, peeling skin, and infected lesions.\n\nCivilians targeted\n\nThe alleged use of chemical weapons came during a large-scale offensive by the Sudanese forces and its allied groups against an armed opposition group, the Sudan Liberation Army-Abdul Wahid (SLA-AW), which operates in the Jebel Marra region.\n\nThe Sudanese government accused the group of looting and attacking civilians and military vehicles prior to the January offensive.\n\nSince the Sudanese military campaign began in January, Amnesty International says up to 250 people have been killed by chemical weapons.\n\nThe report alleges the Sudanese forces targeted civilians: \"The overwhelming majority of the attacked villages had no formal armed opposition presence at the time of the attacks. The purpose...appears to have been to target the entire population of the village.\"\n\nChemical attacks in some regions have been taking place for eight months, including just weeks before the report's release.\n\n'Rumors'\n\nThe Sudanese government has denied allegations it had used chemical weapons against civilians, calling them \"rumors.\"\n\n\"I don't know from where these rumors are being said,\" Sudan's Information Minister Ahmed Bilal told CNN.\n\nBilal acknowledged a government offensive in Jebel Marra had taken place, saying it was in response to rebel activity.\n\n\"It was started by them,\" Bilal said. \"The rebels were doing some sort of looting, they were attacking innocent people. This has stopped. There is not an inch occupied by rebels,\" Bilal said.\n\n\"The whole Darfur is quite in peace and the people are very happy,\" he said.\n\nLikely more than one chemical\n\nJournalists and humanitarians have been prohibited from entering Jebel Marra for more than four years, making reporting extremely difficult from the region.\n\nMustard agent Amnesty International claims to have evidence of the use of suspected chemical weapons in Darfur. It says two independent experts have concluded the evidence suggests exposure to blister agents. Blister agents include sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustard. Sulfur mustard has long been in use as a chemical weapon -- it inflicted horrific casualties in World War I.\n\nMustard agents inflict chemical burns on the skin, eyes and lungs, and can also affect the internal organs. Victims can be disabled as a result of exposure. It can be fatal if they come into contact with large amounts.\n\nWhile damage is caused to the body's cells within minutes of contact with mustard agent, it can take hours before the full effects are felt.\n\nSymptoms can include blistering, itching or severe burning of the skin; weeping eyes, swollen eyelids or even blindness; vomiting and collapse.\n\nThe effects of severe exposure can last for years.\n\nThere's no antidote for mustard agent injury. Sources: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\n\nAmnesty International had to do all reporting remotely. Collecting soil samples for confirmation was impossible.\n\nTwo chemical weapons experts reviewed photographic and video evidence and both found the symptoms consistent with chemical agents such as sulfur mustard, lewisite and nitrogen mustard -- or a combination.\n\n\"The symptoms varied between the attacks and this tells me there were likely more than one chemical in use as well as the possibility that the chemicals were mixed or that different chemicals were used at different times for different attacks,\" said Dr. Jennifer Knaack, one of the weapons experts involved in the study.\n\nThe writer of the report, a senior Amnesty adviser, Jonathan Loeb calls it \"by far the most substantial, credible release of evidence of the use of chemical weapons in Darfur since the conflict began.\"\n\nHistory of conflict\n\nThe conflict in Darfur began around 2003 when several rebel groups in Darfur took up arms against the government in Khartoum. They had grievances over land and historical marginalization.\n\nIn response, the government's counterinsurgency strategy targeted the opposition groups but reportedly expanded to target tribes associated with the insurgents.\n\nThe violence escalated into a war and the in 2008, the UN estimated that 300,000 people may have died in the Darfur conflict, although experts say that figure has likely risen since then.\n\nSudan's President, Omar al-Bashir, was charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, including genocide, related to the Darfur conflict in 2010.\n\nBashir has yet to cooperate with the court and continues to travel freely around the continent. South Africa and Uganda have both been criticized for allowing President Bashir to travel to their countries without being turned over to the ICC.",

    "text": "Carl Bernstein, a CNN political commentator, is the author of \"A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton,\" considered the definitive biography of its subject. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his\n\n(CNN) Not coincidentally, Barack Obama has delivered what historians may judge the most important \u2014 and inspiring \u2014 speech of his presidency at the critical juncture of an election that in all likelihood will determine the future of America for generations.\n\nAnd if Hillary Clinton is to succeed Obama as president, he will probably have to drag her across the finish line. How? By providing some credible perspective that \u2014 in keeping with the truly American values eloquently expressed this weekend in his dedication of the National Museum of African American History and Culture \u2014 vouches for the basic honor of her life and public service, whatever her considerable shortcomings as a presidential candidate. And by drawing a marked contrast between the life and (often un-American) values of Donald Trump.\n\nBarack Obama's vision of America and its history \u2014 the story he told on the Mall Saturday \u2014 recognizes that the great struggle and inspiration of our nation since its founding has been over slavery and its legacy. It is his story. He evoked \u2014 perhaps as no speech has since Martin Luther King shared his dream just yards away 53 years ago \u2014 the agonizing and triumphant narrative of America, which more than anything else, is the story of a nation built by blacks and whites, and shaped by waves of immigration.\n\nAnd that story turns out to be what this election is about.\n\nHillary Clinton, beginning in Monday's debate , must establish once and for all that her values and the story of her life and her politics have always been rooted in this vision of America, and never strayed; and make indelibly clear that Trump's vision \u2014 and all the danger it represents \u2014 is totally at odds with the American story told by Obama on Saturday.\n\n\"The best history helps us recognize the mistakes that we've made, and the dark corners of the human spirit that we need to guard against,\" Obama said. Trump's campaign is the exposition and exploitation of those dark corners.\n\nAmong the key sentences in the President's speech relevant to the debate and election, none were more important than these: \"This museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city, or every rural hamlet. It won't eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods, or immediately ensure that justice is always color blind. It won't wipe away every instance of discrimination in a job interview, or a sentencing hearing, or folks trying to rent an apartment. Those things are up to us, the decisions and choices we make.\"\n\nIn the era of civil rights progress following King's speech, Donald Trump walked in his father's footsteps of bigotry and exclusion to prevent blacks and Puerto Ricans from renting thousands of apartment units owned by the Trumps in the '70s in New York City, in violation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The testimony against Donald Trump's company to this effect is extensive and damning (though, in a consent agreement finally reached with the U.S. Department of Justice in 1975 to rent on a non-discriminatory basis, the Trump Organization did not admit to past discrimination).\n\nIn the instance of Fred and Donald Trump, the sins of the father also became the sins of the son. And they endure in his campaign and its underlying assumptions about America and Trump's misreading of its history. They are among the elemental facts at our command to understand Donald Trump \u2014 today and yesterday.\n\nJUST WATCHED New poll: Clinton, Trump in dead heat before debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New poll: Clinton, Trump in dead heat before debate 00:47\n\nNot Hillary Clinton. Hugh Rodham, her father, also embraced the bigotry of his era, and at the family dinner table routinely described blacks in the most demeaning and bigoted terms. But when Hillary was a teenager, a youth minister took her to hear Martin Luther King Jr. preach in Chicago. In college, her advocacy against racial discrimination on and off campus became increasingly activist, and since then, the constant of her public service and her political and cultural beliefs and advocacy has been about equality in every regard for all citizens, and an end to all forms of discrimination.\n\nIt is a straight line from the Trump family's rental policies to Donald Trump's campaign policies appealing to bigotry and racism and nativism. None of this is to deny the validity of his (or Bernie Sanders') recognition of the economic marginalization of so many working-class Americans over the past quarter-century, or the apparent blindness of the country's \"elites\" to their suffering.\n\n\"And so this museum provides context for the debate of our times, it illuminates them, and gives us some sense of how they evolved, and perhaps keeps them in proportion,\" Obama said Saturday.\n\nThrough much of this campaign, Hillary Clinton has been her own worst enemy, often failing to explain what truly motivates her quest for the White House.\n\nBeginning in Monday's debate, Clinton needs to tell the story of her life over and over in the context of her advocacy for the kind of America Barack Obama summoned on Saturday.\n\nThe press, too, should reflect on the President's assertion of \"context for the debate of our times,\" and the notion of \"proportion\" in describing and comparing the lives and records of the two candidates and their visions for America.\n\nObama also said:\n\n\"And that's what this museum explains, the fact that our stories have shaped every corner of our culture, the struggles for freedom that took place made our Constitution a real and living document, tested, and shaped, and deepened, and made more profound its meaning for all people.\n\n\"The story told here doesn't just belong to black Americans, it belongs to all Americans, for the African-American experience has been shaped just as much by Europeans and Asians and Native Americans and Latinos. We have informed each other. We are polyglot, a stew.\n\n\"Scripture promised that if we lift up the oppressed, that our light will rise in the darkness, and our night will become like the noonday. And the story contained in this museum makes those words prophecy. And that's what this day is about, that's what this museum's about.\"\n\nAnd that's what the presidential election of 2016 is really about, as he implied.\n\nThe outright \u2014 and underlying \u2014 racism of Trump and his campaign will have to compete from now until November 8 against this vision of America laid out by Obama as the President campaigns intensely on Hillary Clinton's behalf in the remaining 42 days before the election, and notes her fealty to those ideals in a lifetime spent in the political arena. None of this is to deny some of her personal failures and shortcomings on such vivid display since she announced her campaign for the presidency and -- in some instances -- throughout her public life.\n\nJUST WATCHED A short history of Donald Trump's 'birther' claims Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A short history of Donald Trump's 'birther' claims 02:23\n\nIn the end, this election is a choice between two different sets of values and visions for America and the real lives lived by the two candidates \u2014 not the self-created images or mythical lives of either. Again, the press needs to focus less on the horse race and more on the backgrounds and records of the horses before they got here.\n\n\"And so hopefully this museum can help us talk to each other,\" the president said. \"And more importantly, listen to each other. And most importantly, see each other \u2014 black and white and Latino and Native American and Asian American \u2014 see how our stories are bound together. And bound together with women in America, and workers in America, and entrepreneurs in America, and LGBT Americans.\"\n\nThat has been the undertaking of Hillary Clinton's life \u2014 not Donald Trump's.\n\nThe closing paragraphs of \"A Woman in Charge, The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton\" \u2014 hardly an uncritical biography of its subject, as the Clintons have made clear in their discomfort with the book \u2014 are about the opportunity that now lies before her, concluding:\n\n\"As a girl and then as a woman, Hillary has almost always been desperate to be a passionate participant and at the center of events: familial, generational, experiential, political, historical. Call it ambition, call it the desire to make the world a better place \u2014 she has been driven. Rarely has she stepped aside voluntarily into passivity. Introspection, however, has not been her strong suit; faith in the Lord, and in herself, is.\n\n\"Three pillars have held her up through one crisis after another in a life creased by personal difficulties and public and private battles: her religious faith; her powerful urge toward both service and its accompanying sense (for good or ill) of self-importance; and a fierce desire for privacy and secrecy. It is the last of these that seems to cast a larger and larger shadow over who she really is...\n\n\"Hillary is neither the demon of the right's perception, nor a feminist saint, nor is she particularly emblematic of her time \u2014 perhaps more old-fashioned than modern. Hers is a story of strength and vulnerability, a woman's story. She is an intelligent woman endowed with energy, enthusiasm, humor, tempestuousness, inner strength, spontaneity in private, lethal (almost) powers of retribution, real-life lines that come from deep wounds, and the language skills of a sailor (and of a minister), all evidence of her passion \u2014 which, down deep, is perhaps her most enduring and even endearing trait....\n\n\"Great politicians have always been marked by the consistency of their core beliefs, their strength of character in advocacy, and the self-knowledge that informs bold leadership. Almost always, Hillary has stood for good things. Yet there is often a disconnect between her convictions and words, and her actions. This is where Hillary disappoints. But the jury remains out. She still has time to prove her case, to effectuate those things that make her special, not fear them or camouflage them. We would all be the better for it, because what lies within may have the potential to change the world, if only a little.\"",

It would stretch to a comparatively modest 130 meters, but it won't come cheap.\n\n\"Cost? You're probably looking at \u00a3200 million to \u00a3500 million ($267 million to $667 million),\" the British designer tells CNN. \"It depends on the finish of the interior.\n\nPhotos: Lights, camera, action Photos: Lights, camera, action Do you want your superyacht to stand out at sea? Well, how about one which comes equipped with 600 flashing lights? Welcome aboard, Moonstone -- the peacock of the yachting world. Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: Lights, camera, action The result of an Oceanco and Van Geest Design cooperation, Moonstone -- named after the gemstone -- is a luxury vessel that literally shines thanks to an array of effects that create a visual extravaganza. Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: Lights, camera, action \"The yacht is not just a yacht anymore; it becomes an experience. An experience that is always surprising,\" Pieter van Geest of Van Geest Design tells CNN. \"Moonstone allows the owner to choose an ever-changing experience on board; their boat has the ability to never appear the same. This is unique and never seen before -- no one's ever had the ability to be different whenever they want.\" Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: Lights, camera, action Moonstone's 600 LED triangles are split into two sets of 300, spread across each side of the ship's 90-meter long hull -- and all can be controlled via an app. \"The light panels represent flexibility in design and appearance,\" Van Geest says. \"Initially we wanted to recreate the twinkle effect of the sunlight on water, but by having the ability to create patterns and even images we get to limitless possibilities.\" Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: Lights, camera, action Moonstone doesn't just stop with lights. The superyacht also comes complete with special backlit surfaces linked to fish-eye cameras which can capture the color of the sky or reflect of a sunrise. Hide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: Lights, camera, action \"The inspiration behind Moonstone was basically nature. Yachts and ships rarely look like they belong in their environment; they break the horizon and sometimes even spoil the landscape,\" Van Geest says. \"Our goal was to design something that can belong in, and enhance its surroundings.\" Hide Caption 6 of 9 Photos: Lights, camera, action Any potential buyers thinking that all those lights can't be good for the environment, fear not. They've been designed to be self-sufficient, sitting beneath with 70-square-meter solar panels. A full day's sunlight, it is estimated, will allow the lights on Moonstone to run for up to three hours. Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: Lights, camera, action Besides its striking lighting features, Moonstone comes with all the usual mod cons you'd expect to find on any respectable superyacht. A cinema, gym, helicopter pad and wellness area are just a few of the facilities on offer, while sticking to the boat's theme, its swimming pool comes with dimmable lights to add even more glow to the party. Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: Lights, camera, action Moonstone can be ready for use within three years. But if that sounds like too long to hang around, you could always just buy those 600 LED lights instead... \"We don't have to engineer the light features anymore,\" Van Geest says. \"So if somebody wants this, they can press the button and have it now. This is not a dream. It's not a dream, this is actually reality.\" Hide Caption 9 of 9\n\n\"If it's gold swan taps in every bathroom, then the price of the interior can be three times a more modern design. So it totally depends on the client and what they want.\"\n\nIts owner will be able to enjoy an entire deck to themselves, complete with private cinema, jacuzzi, gym and spa, while guests will be able to take advantage of the same luxuries on the VIP deck below.\n\nThe chances of the yacht being built are around \"one in a thousand,\" Waugh admits, but cost, surprisingly, isn't one of the major potential stumbling blocks.\n\n\"Lots of people like Epiphany, but what you hear a lot of the time is: 'I like this but ... I've got my own idea and I want something that is a bit more sensible,'\" the London-based designer explains.\n\nPhotos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Morphology \u2013 If you've ever dreamed of traveling the world and exploring little-known locations, then the MORPHotel might be the holiday of the future for you. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Vertebral spine \u2013 Designed by engineer and architect Gianluca Santosuosso, the MORPHotel project aims to develop a new luxury hotel concept. The hotel's \"vertebral spine\" allows it to adapt its shape according to weather conditions and its docking location. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Four to the floor \u2013 The MORPHotel concept is based on four main strategies: Space in between; plug-in city-harbor; adaptive shape; and self-sufficiency. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Space in between \u2013 The MORPHotel uses the sea not only to get visitors from A to B -- as cruise ships do -- but also to explore the areas along the way. Cruise ships' fuel consumption tends to be around 470 liters/km, while the MORPHotel will rely on following sea currents around the world. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Plug-in city-harbor \u2013 During its journey around the world, the MORPHotel will stop in cities it encounters along the way and will become a temporary extension to them. It will provide added value for its inhabitants, who can take advantage of its services such as a theater, restaurants and fitness center, while the city will open up to the hotel guests. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' The \"Tourizen\" \u2013 Santosuosso believes such a feature will allow the traditional separation between \"tourist\" and \"citizen\" to disappear, leaving space for a new entity: The \"tourizen.\" Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Adaptive shape \u2013 This allows the MORPHotel to not only reach the cities' harbors by changing its shape, but to also become an independent aquatic organism. Given its 1 km spine, the hotel can spiral in on itself on ocean crossings to become an artificial bay where boats and ships can find shelter. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Self-sufficiency \u2013 \"One of the fundamental goals that we want to attain in this project is to create a big, independent, self-sufficient artificial organism,\" Santosuosso explains. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Energetic \u2013 Energy will be provided by solar panels placed along the upper part of the hull and glass panels, and also by the two ends of the spine through the movement of waves. It will also collect rainwater while desalinating sea water. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Invention of the 'tourizen' Floating farm \u2013 This self-sufficiency will also be used to produce certain types of food, as each of the central vertebra will contain a small vegetable garden. This part of the hotel will work as a big floating farm, where it will grow vegetables, rear animals and store foodstuffs.

Even then they tend to fall in and out of love with stuff on a whim,\" he says.\n\n\"I was doing a design for a Norwegian but it fell through because he couldn't sell his boat. So there are all sorts of reasons why things don't happen. Very random, really.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Making history in Saint-Tropez Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Making history in Saint-Tropez 07:36\n\nClients for superyachts costing over \u00a3100 million ($133 million) tend to come from the Middle East or Russia, Waugh says, but their reason for buying can vary greatly.\n\nIs it ego?\n\n\"Sometimes it is,\" he says, adding that there is competition between rich Saudis and Emiratis to have the biggest boat.\n\n\"But some guys just love yachting, they love the comfort of having a motor yacht and like to cruise around and they go to the Caribbean on it -- it's an adventure for them.\n\n\"That's one side of the market. They tend to use their yachts a lot. Then there's another side where it really is just about spending money for the sake of it and saying you've got the biggest yacht.\n\n\"Those guys might spend three weeks a year on the yacht and it's costing them tens of millions a year. A bit of an expensive toy, really.\"",

That's when Trump bet big on Atlantic City by amassing property along the boardwalk.\n\n\"When casino gaming came into Atlantic City, it was a monopoly,\" says Marvin Roffman, a former gaming analyst for a prominent financial services firm. \"They had basically the whole eastern market to themselves and everyone was looking for land to build a casino.\"\n\nTrump, basking in the success of building the Trump Tower in New York City, liked those odds. In 1984, he opened Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and the following year he opened Trump's Castle. It was all part of Trump's spending spree in the late 1980s that included the iconic Plaza Hotel in New York, the famed Palm Beach Estate Mar-A-Lago, the Eastern Air shuttle which he renamed the Trump Shuttle, the 282-foot Trump Princess yacht and the largest tract of undeveloped land on the west side of Manhattan.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "Dov Fox is associate professor of law and director of the Center for Health Law Policy & Bioethics at the University of San Diego School of Law. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) The upcoming Supreme Court term promises to be a sleeper. Still down a justice, the court isn't slated to hear its usual blockbusters on the likes of abortion, affirmative-action or same-sex marriage. But its first day back in session does feature at least one intriguing controversy in the case of Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez v. Colorado.\n\nAt the heart of the case are two incompatible visions of what a jury is supposed to be. The first ideal emphasizes objective decision-making. It demands that jurors arrive at verdicts free of any influence beyond the testimony and evidence that's presented in court. The second ideal stresses jurors' subjectivity. It insists on a jury of peers that can speak as the voice of the community. How can jurors remain unbiased, however, while relying on the very experiences and perspectives that bias them?\n\nThe case before the Supreme Court on Tuesday will force it to reconcile these two seemingly irreconcilable ideals of the jury. The court should resolve this tension by recognizing important differences among different forms of bias: There are some biases that discredit a jury's verdict just as surely as others legitimize it. The challenge, of course, is distinguishing good bias from bad.\n\nThe objective ideal of the jury goes back to the treason trial of founding father and Vice President Aaron Burr at the turn of the 19th century. Amid widely publicized accusations that Burr sought to establish a new country in parts of Texas and surrounding territories, Chief Justice John Marshall insisted on jurors who would have no biases or \" any prepossessions whatever .\" Think of Lady Justice's blindfold. A federal judge in California recently captured this ideal when he instructed jurors to \"take all of the experiences that ... have contributed to how you think about everything\" and \" lay those experiences aside \" as what \"we call ... your biases.\"\n\nBut those experiences are precisely what makes a jury of one's peers representative. A Washington court captured this second, subjective ideal when it emphasized that a jury \"is expected to bring its opinions, insights, common sense, and everyday life experience into deliberations.\" Here, the blindfold of impartiality deprives jurors of the context that helps them appreciate what's right for their own time and place in the world.\n\nThat's why the Constitution requires drawing jurors from the community at large. It's also why federal rules shield jury deliberations from public view, thereby preserving safe harbor for the messy process by which \"any prepossessions\" might inform a just verdict.\n\nThese rival ideals lie at the heart of Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez v. Colorado. A jury convicted Miguel Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez of assaulting two teenage girls and sentenced him as a sex offender. After the verdict, two jurors submitted affidavits stating that a third, H.C., made racist comments during deliberations. H.C. urged conviction, they reported, \" because [Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez] is Mexican and Mexican men ... believe they c[an] do whatever they want[] with women.\" H.C. also argued that the alibi witness who placed Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez elsewhere couldn't be believed because he was \"an illegal.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Supreme Court rules 7-1 in favor of death row inmate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Supreme Court rules 7-1 in favor of death row inmate 01:09\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court held that these statements didn't entitle Pe\u00f1a Rodriguez to a new trial. It framed the issue, like other courts have, as a tradeoff between, on the one hand, the finality of verdicts and avoiding potential juror harassment, and, on the other, the defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial. But this misses a deeper question about what makes a trial fair in the first place. Is it an objective jury or a subjective one?\n\nEach ideal has appeal. But both suffer from the same problem: They treat all forms of bias the same. In fact, some forms of bias are bad and should be purged from the jury, while others, even those related to race, are good and worth preserving. The US Supreme Court should accordingly draw a line that others like the Colorado Supreme Court have refused to: \" between different types of juror bias ..., whereby one form of partiality would implicate a party's Sixth Amendment right [to an impartial jury] while another would not.\"\n\nUntil now, the court has been unwilling to pull back the curtain of jury secrecy. In the 2014 case of Warger v. Shauers , Shauers' truck hit Warger's motorcycle. Warger lost his left leg in the crash and sued Shauers for negligence. During jury selection, a prospective juror who was later selected as foreperson told Warger's lawyers that there was no reason she wouldn't be able to award personal injury damages in the case.\n\nAfter the jury ruled for Shauers, however, another juror disclosed that the foreperson had revealed during deliberations that her own daughter had been at fault in a fatal car crash and that, if she had been held liable, it would have \"ruined her life.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor held for a unanimous court that the verdict couldn't be appealed based on evidence that a juror lied during jury selection. She noted in a prescient footnote, however, that certain \"cases of juror bias [may be] so extreme \" that \"the jury trial right has been abridged.\"\n\nThe court will hear that case on Tuesday. As Sotomayor implicitly recognized, not all jury bias is cut from the same cloth. Self-serving conflicts of interest and secondhand rumors about the litigants tend to erode sound decision making. But familiarity with shared experiences and understanding of social norms aren't always corrupting. Some can even enrich a verdict.\n\nThe juror who identifies with the young person accused of reckless driving or dealing drugs might be blinded by \" resentment against the system that punished \" that juror or her loved ones. But she also might bring a crucial perspective about unfamiliar social circumstances that should be heard in the jury's deliberations.\n\nJUST WATCHED Supreme Court rules in favor of death row inmate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Supreme Court rules in favor of death row inmate 01:12\n\nMore complex still are attitudes about the ideological causes or demographic affiliations that might lead jurors to sympathize with one party or the other. Consider death penalty cases. Some people have conscientious scruples against capital punishment or believe that defendants from disadvantaged groups in particular deserve mercy because the criminal justice system tends to treat them worse. Others favor the death penalty as a symbol of opposition to social deviance or a commitment to individual responsibility. Both these perspectives have an important role to play in jury deliberations.\n\nLikewise, that a young black defendant from a poor neighborhood fled from the police, for instance, might be regarded by a juror from an affluent background as evidence of the defendant's guilt. But that same fact might be construed by a juror who grew up under similar conditions as evidence that the defendant feared mistreatment by police. Neither should be excluded simply because their views reflects an outside source of juror influence.\n\nBut racism should. Views about the real-world effects of discrimination are not pernicious like base stereotypes that \"illegals\" lie or that \"Mexican men...believe they c[an] do whatever they want[] with women.\" Empathy deepens deliberations no less than bigotry debases them. Scruples can inform the jury as much as dogmatism infects it.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWhen the Supreme Court sets out to reconcile these two ideals of the jury, it should allow defendants to challenge a verdict only when evidence reveals animus, dogmatism or other biases like financial conflicts or family relationships that would have warranted keeping people off the jury in the first place. These forms of bias (alone) our criminal justice system cannot tolerate.\n\nA ruling along these lines could even support changes in other questions about the jury: For example, broadening the kinds of diversity required in the pool of prospective jurors, narrowing the reasons that would-be jurors are automatically excluded from serving or instructing those who make it onto the jury to deliberate in ways that encourage perspective sharing and open-minded cooperation. A just vision of the jury that takes seriously its conflicting ideals begins by recognizing that all bias is not equal.",

Please see below for a full rushed transcript.\n\nMANDATORY CREDIT // CNN The Situation Room\n\nAdditional information: The Situation Room:http://www.cnn.com/shows/situation-room\n\nSTORY: Clinton agrees to N.H debate\u2014 but won\u2019\u2019t commit to more\n\nText highlights:\n\nClinton on the possibility of more Democratic Presidential debates: [BLITZER]:\"So you are willing to commit to three specific dates for additional debates after New Hampshire? [CLINTON]: Oh, I said, look, I'm - we have another one shortly after New Hampshire, as I remember, on the calendar. And I said we should start looking for dates and working to get those scheduled. I'm perfectly fine with that.But first things first. We have to agree that we're going to debate in New Hampshire, both the governor and I have agreed and we're waiting for the senator to decide to join us. [BLITZER]: So I just want to be precise. After the Democratic National Committee sanctions debates, you are now ready to commit to three more debates, is that right?[CLINTON]: Well, I have been very public in saying I would like the DNC to work with all of the campaigns, because that's what it did when it set up this schedule and obviously, we want to be supportive. But I am urging publicly that we do this debate next week in New Hampshire. And then I've said I am more than happy for us to start scheduling additional debates as we go through the spring and April and May and try to get those on the calendar.\u201d\n\nClinton responds to Trump\u2019s veterans event and tonight\u2019s GOP debate: \"You know, I am certainly not going to get into the machinations of the Republican Party primary process, other than to say I deeply regret the tone, the rhetoric that you're hearing, not only from Mr. Trump, but a number of the other candidates, the kinds of insulting remarks they're making about groups of people in our country, their strong opposition to The Affordable Care Act, wanting to defund Planned Parenthood, coming back to trickle down economics.\n\nYou know, it's really quite a disturbing spectacle that we have going on. So whether or not they are together when they debate and reinforce these positions, which I think would be so harmful to our country, is something that, you know, they have to decide among themselves.But I'm going to continue to point out the stakes in this election, because ultimately, it will come down to one Democratic nominee and one Republican, who are fighting for the future of America. And I strongly disagree with the direction that the Republicans intend to take our country. And that's why I'm fighting so hard to be that Democratic nominee, to be able to make the case that we want to build on the progress we've made and we sure don't want the Republicans ripping it all apart.\"\n\nClinton on female voter turnout in the election: \"Well, look, I am thrilled to have so much support from leading women in our country, from elected women, from women activists, from organizations like Planned Parenthood fighting for women's rights. I'm running to be president because I think I have the best combination of experience, qualifications, plans and ability to get the job done.\n\nBut I do think it's an asset to be running to be the first woman president. And I want everyone, women and men, in all parts of our country, to join me in making sure we build on the progress we've made and not let the Republicans rip away the White House and set us back.\"\n\nClinton responds to the idea of appointing President Obama to the Supreme Court: \"Well, I have no idea that he'd ever be interested, but it was a fascinating idea. And if I'm so fortune enough to be president and get the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, which I hope I do, then I would certainly talk to him about it. I think he has other plans for his future, but hey, it would be worth the effort. We know he's a brilliant writer. He taught constitutional law. So I think it's worth a try.\"\n\nFULL POST",

    "text": "(CNN) U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have been immersing themselves in Argentinian culture during their visit to South America, tangoing with professional dancers at a state dinner in Buenos Aires.\n\nWhile beef is the backbone of Argentina's daily diet, there are plenty of other tasty treats awaiting the Obamas in the world's eighth-largest country.\n\nBesides taking inspiration from Italian and Spanish migrants, Argentina's dishes also feature ingredients from the Andean northwest as well as Patagonia in the south.\n\nReady to start eating?\n\nHere are 10 of the top dishes every visitor to Argentina should try.\n\nEmpanadas\n\nArgentina's favorite street food, these stuffed dough pockets are similar to Puerto Rico's empanadilla or a Cornish pasty.\n\nTranslating as \"wrapped in bread,\" empanadas come baked or fried and can be veggie or carnivorous.\n\nCommon fillings include chicken, cheese and ham, sweetcorn, caprese or blue cheese.\n\nBeef -- either chopped or sliced by hand -- is always a popular option, though seasoning such as cumin, spring onion, boiled egg or potato depends on the province of origin.\n\nLook out for regional specialties, too: quinoa and goat's cheese in the northwest province of Jujuy, or lamb in Patagonia.\n\nSo how to tell the difference between flavors?\n\nMost empanader\u00edas provide a handy repulgue (a term used to describe the method used to fold the edges of the dough) map as a guide through the different crimped edges, which denote flavors.\n\nChoripan\n\nAnother cheap and cheerful street food hit, choripan is usually served as an entree at an asado (barbecue).\n\nBut thanks to its hands-on shape, this sausage sandwich (where chorizo or sausage teams up with pan or bread) is an ideal snack for travelers on the go.\n\nYou can slather it in chimichurri, a spicy sauce made from oregano, parsley, garlic, chili flakes and red wine vinegar -- or salsa criolla, a tomato, onion and red bell pepper variant.\n\nWhile chorizo is usually made from pork, boar sausages can also be found in some restaurants.\n\nPizza\n\nArgentina pizza: The world's cheesiest.\n\nWhile Argentinian pies might share some physical resemblances with their Neapolitan cousins -- they have a circular form and dough base.\n\nThat's where the similarities end.\n\nInch-high crusts tend to go light on tomato sauce while overcompensating with so much Argentinian-style mozzarella cheese, it drips down the side.\n\nGarnishes include green olives, oregano, or dried chili flakes.\n\nAn entire cheese-and-tomato pizza is often simply referred to as una muzza.\n\nSome traditional pizzerias in Buenos Aires sell by the slice, designed to be eaten standing at the bar.\n\nCustomers can also order faina, a filling slice of chickpea pancake, to soak up the gooey cheese.\n\nMilanesa\n\nAnother Argentinian dish with Italian influence is milanesa, known as escalope in the rest of the world.\n\nUsually made from silverside -- a round of beef from the outside of the leg -- or chicken breast, the meat is hammered down to a thin cut before being bathed in breadcrumbs, then either fried or baked.\n\nToppings, however, raise this dish's excitement levels.\n\nA caballo (on horseback) means topped with a fried egg, a la napolitana ups the ante with cheese and tomato sauce, while a la suiza uses gruyere.\n\nLarger appetites should order completa, with ham, cheese and tomato sauce. Best accompanied with French fries and a token salad.\n\nProvoleta\n\nThis soft, round, provolone cheese is a fairly bland eating experience -- until it's slapped on the grill.\n\nProvoleta, made from cow's milk, then turns into gooey goodness and is a classic starter to an Argentinian asado, or barbecue.\n\nGrilled in a specially sized skillet or a simple foil dish, provoleta is often topped with oregano and should be slightly crisp on the outside yet melted on the inside.\n\nFor a creamy yet acidic taste, try the goat's milk provoleta.\n\nAsado\n\nBeef's so tempting in Argentina that even vegetarians have been known to succumb to its wiles.\n\nThe best way to sample it is at an asado, which refers to both a barbecue as well as a traditional way of grilling beef.\n\nIt's the most important social event in Argentina, bringing together friends and families every weekend.\n\nA multi-step meal that can last several hours, entrees include choripan, morcilla (blood sausage) and provoleta before moving onto organ meats such as mollejas (beef sweetbreads), chinchulines (chitterlings) and rinones (kidneys).\n\nBuilding up to the main game, we recommend trying matambrito de cerdo (pork flank steak) drizzled in lemon juice before tucking into one of several cuts such as tender ojo de bife (ribeye); bife de chorizo (sirloin), which comes with a strip of fat; tasty asado de tira (short ribs); and full-flavored entrana (skirt steak).\n\nWhile an asado at an Argentinan's home is the most legitimate experience, some restaurants serve the next best thing -- a parrillada, which is a small portable grill complete with glowing coals that keeps cuts warm.\n\nLlama\n\nBelieve it or not, there's a slice of llama hiding under all that pretty foliage.\n\nEating llama steak is the norm in Argentina's northwest, given that the camelid is well adapted to the Jujuy province's 2,000-plus meters above sea level altitude.\n\nWhile its flavor is more rustic and earthy than beef, fat levels are lower, which makes it a healthy alternative.\n\nIt can be sampled in empanadas, a stew or as a standalone steak. Some swankier restaurants even use it in carpaccio or tartare.\n\nHumita\n\nEaten as a savory snack or a main course, humita is the ultimate corn tribute. Leaf packages are untied to reveal the corn mash inside.\n\nThe whole package is either steamed or boiled.\n\nDating back to pre-Columbian times, humita is eaten around the Andean region, including Chile, Bolivia and Peru.\n\nMade with fresh corn and milk, onion, spices and sometimes goat cheese are added to pep it up.\n\nLocro\n\nA hearty stew, locro is a national dish traditionally served on May 25, the date marking Argentina's May Revolution.\n\nMade from white corn, beef or pork, tripe and red chorizo, as well as other vegetables including white beans, squash and pumpkin, and seasoned with cumin and bay leaf, this tasty meal in a bowl is an ideal winter warmer.\n\nIt can be ramped up with a dash of quiquirimichi, a hot salsa made from paprika, spring onion and chili.\n\nAlso worth a trying, carbonada is a similar dish that includes sweetcorn that's served inside a baked, seasoned pumpkin.\n\nDulce de leche\n\nSome Argentinians would argue that licking dulce de leche (caramelized milk and sugar sauce) from a spoon is a meal in itself.\n\nHowever, this sweet and sticky salsa usually accompanies desserts such as flan.\n\nA better invention is dulce de leche-flavor helado.\n\nAny ice-cream parlor that didn't stock it would soon go out of business; the bonus is that Argentinian ice-cream is thick and creamy, giving Italian gelato a decent run for its money.\n\nFor the ultimate sugar rush, DDL cones can be topped up with a little (or a lot of) DDL sauce.",

    "text": "(CNN) On the surface, there's little out of the ordinary at Japan's Jison-In Temple complex.\n\nSitting at the foot of Mount Koya -- the country's most spiritual peak -- in the small town of Kudoyama in Wakayama prefecture, it's a textbook example of Japanese Buddhist architecture.\n\nUpon closer inspection, however, one notices an abundance of something a bit, well, out of a place at a site of spiritual reverence.\n\nThe temple grounds are filled with thousands of depictions of female breasts.\n\nLeft hanging in various corners of the complex, these busty decorations are actually left by visitors as spiritual offerings.\n\nAnd, perhaps adding to the authenticity, they come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nJison'In Temple's head priest, Annen.\n\nSome are puffy, made with fabric and stuffed with what appears to be foam, their nipples bedazzled with tiny beads.\n\nOthers are simply blocks of wood topped with circular mounds dotted with pink nipples that hang from a string.\n\nNot all have a three-dimensional appearance -- there are also wooden plaques simply featuring painted images of busts.\n\nAccording to the temple's head priest, Annen, it all began years ago when a doctor from the nearby city of Wakayama came to pray for a patient who was undergoing treatment for breast cancer.\n\nThe doctor asked temple staff to place a symbol of female breasts as an offering.\n\nWord of the unusual request began to spread and soon the temple became known as a site to pray for women's health issues.\n\n\"The breasts represent birth, so people use them to pray for safe pregnancies, protection from cancer and even a healthy breast milk supply,\" says Annen, who has been head of Jison-In for over 40 years.\n\nBeing the only temple in Japan with such a specialized form of offerings -- breasts can be purchased on-site -- Jison-In receives visitors from all over the world, says Annen.\n\nA rack of offerings at Jison-In.\n\nGateway to Japan's most sacred mountain\n\nThe temple's strong connection to themes of motherhood dates back over 1,000 years.\n\nJison-in is a gateway to the sacred Mount Koya, or Koyasan.\n\nKoyasan was first settled in 816 by Kobo Daishi -- the founder of Shingon Buddhism, a Chinese-influenced esoteric sect introduced to Japan in the year 806.\n\nToday, Koyasan has a population of around 3,000 and functions as the Shingon Buddhism headquarters for more than 4,000 temples and missions throughout Japan and overseas.\n\nJison-in's busty offerings come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nUp until the late 1800s women were not allowed to visit the mountain, thus Jison-in became a sacred site of worship for them.\n\nAmong the temple's residents was Kobo Daishi's very own mother.\n\nAccording to legend, he walked back and forth from Mount Koya -- 24 kilometers each way -- nine times a month to see her there.\n\n(And to think some sons even struggle to remember to call dear ol' ma on her birthday.)\n\n\"That's why the town is called Kudoyama -- 'Nine Times Mountain',\" says Annen.\n\nMore: World's best unknown hike, Japan's Kumano Kodo\n\nHiking the Choishi Michi trail\n\nJison-In marks the entrance the Koyasan Choishi Michi trail -- known in English as the Koyasan Stone Marker Path.\n\nDesignated a site of national importance in 1977, it's made up of 180 \"choishi,\" or stone markers, each of which features five tiers to represent the principle elements of the esoteric Buddhist universe.\n\nThe Choishimichi Trail is about 24 kilometers long.\n\nStone marker number 180, at Jison-in, marks the start of the pilgrimage route.\n\nThe trail is about 24 kilometers long -- it's the same route Kobo Daishi took -- and features a stone marker every 109 meters leading to the Danjo Garan temple complex, one of the most holy sites on Mount Koya.\n\nLocal tourism officials say over 80% of the markers still standing today were constructed in Japan's Kamakura period (1185-1333).\n\nIn those days, Koyasan pilgrims would stop and pray at each marker as they made their way up to the mountain.\n\nDuring our visit to Jison-in and subsequent hike on the Choishi Michi trail the rains are heavy, but this doesn't detract from the overall experience.\n\nThe downpours shroud the mountainous terrain in a misty veil, providing a delightfully eerie vibe to the walk.\n\nIt's a weekday so we pass only a handful of fellow pilgrims as we hike, though our guide says the trails can get incredibly busy on weekends and holidays.\n\nBesides the stone markers, shrines and deities can be spotted along the way, as well as the odd basket filled with fruit from Wakayama's famed orchards.\n\nPilgrims follow the honor system and leave their cash in a provided container.\n\nThis two-storey pagoda is part of Koyasan's sacred Danjo Garan site.\n\nGetting there\n\nJison-in is located in the town of Kudoyama, in Wakayama prefecture.\n\nTrains depart regularly for Kudoyama from Osaka's Namba Station. The ride takes about an hour.",

    "text": "Conservationists fear for the survival of the rare pangolin which is thought to be the most trafficked animal in the world. CNN went to South Africa to investigate why this shy ant eater is so threatened.\n\nTswalu Nature Reserve, South Africa (CNN) The ping is steady at first and then it quickens. Armed with an antenna in one hand and a receiver in the other, researcher Wendy Panaino turns toward the red sand dune. \"He's still in his burrow, it's just over, under the dune.\"\n\nAs the sun sets in the horizon in this remote corner of the Kalahari, Panaino's night begins the same way it has for the past several months. She stands absolutely still and silently waits, listening for the sound of scales rubbing against vegetation.\n\n\"You could spend years in the bush and not see one because they are so quiet and so shy most of the time,\" she says. \"You could walk past one and not only know it is there.\"\n\nMysterious creature\n\nUp until now, that is what has made the ground pangolin so difficult to observe. Without the radio tracking, Panaino says, her research would be impossible to carry out.\n\n\"In terms of free roaming, wild pangolins like this one, there is almost next to nothing known about them,\" she said.\n\nWhat is known is that the ground pangolin, along with the seven other species found across Africa and Asia are under threat in a big way. The world's most trafficked animal is just decades away from extinction.\n\nHunted for its meat across Africa, its scales are targeted in Asia where more than 15 traditional Chinese remedies call for pangolin scales as an ingredient. The ingredient though, nothing more than the keratin also found in rhino horn and human fingernails has been proven to have no medicinal benefits.\n\n\"It's an absolute tragedy,\" said Panaino. \"They are so rare and so unique. It's really sad to see their population numbers declining so rapidly.\"\n\nA ground pangolin emerges from its burrow to begin a night of foraging for food\n\nFor a researcher who has seen more wild pangolins than just about anyone, that's why every sighting is so special, why she's content to spend solitary nights in the bush chasing the shy and elusive animal.\n\n\"Do you hear it? There it is,\" the researcher said, turning on her headlamp and heading toward the sound. \"My heart is racing.\"\n\nA prehistoric look\n\nThe cat-sized animal scampers across the red sand on its back feet, using its front claws to feel its way through the thicket.\n\nWith its tightly interlocking scales glistening against the torch light, it looks prehistoric, but with its little ears and long nose and tongue that it uses to find one ant and termite mound after the other, it also looks harmless.\n\nPangolins under threat Pangolins are about the size of a cat\n\nThey are trafficked for their scales\n\nThe meat is considered a delicacy\n\nScales are used in traditional medicine\n\nThousands are trafficked each year\n\nAll species are protected by international treaty\n\nNo-one knows how many are left\n\nWhen threatened, the pangolin will roll up into a ball instead of fleeing -- its scales, tough enough to protect it from lions, but not from poachers.\n\nA tightly curled ball of scales is exactly how the sample comes out of the freezer at the National Zoo's bio bank in Pretoria. It was a giant ground pangolin from central Africa, the continent's largest and also rarest species, seized by customs and given to the bio bank for research.\n\n\"Like with all wildlife trafficking, the trade is underground,\" said researcher Ray Jansen. \"Just like the ivory, tiger bone, lion bone trade, it's the same syndicates, operating the same way and the customers are the same people.\"\n\nThose customers are increasingly in Asia where the four endemic species have been poached to the brink of extinction.\n\nJansen brings out a black plastic bag filled with scales, sent from Hong Kong customs after a large bust last year. This year alone, Jansen says, an estimated 15 tons of pangolin scales have left Africa for the Asian market.\n\n\"You can pick up one of these scales and feel how light it is,\" said Jansen. Now try to imagine fifteen tons of that.\"\n\nThis month, the world's governing body on wildlife trade voted to give pangolins increased protection, banning all international trade of pangolin parts.\n\nWendy Panaino is one of the few researchers studying wild pangolins\n\nThe decision by the 183 governments at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Johannesburg was unanimous for the African species.\n\n\"The rate at which they are being killed is completely unsustainable and cruel,\" said Mark Hofberg from the International Fund for Animal Welfare. \"If nothing is done, we could see these amazing creatures disappear within a generation.\"\n\nDNA clues to trafficking\n\nBut laws only go so far, and Jansen worries the illicit trade in the African range states will continue unabated.\n\nResearchers examine the DNA of seized pangolin scales in hopes of better understanding its genetics to stop the illegal trade\n\n\"I'd be surprised if 5% of the existing trade was legal. To put it out on the ground and stop things like the bush meat market is incredibly difficult to enforce.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Inside the illegal wildlife trade Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Inside the illegal wildlife trade 07:07\n\nResearch happening here may help. Jansen and others are using the confiscated scales to track the trade right down to a genetic level.\n\nBy studying the DNA, they hope to discover which species are being trafficked from which hotspots. Only then can meaningful enforcement measures be put in place, said Jansen.\n\nBut even that level of understanding is still years away, researchers admit.\n\n\"We don't know the number of animals in Africa, we don't know the occurrence, no one really knows where they are,\" said research manager Antoinette Kotze. \"Basic research needs to come first.\"",

Hide Caption 17 of 17\n\nIt hasn't always been like this.\n\nFor most of aviation history, airlines operated in a tightly regulated, uncompetitive environment, where air fares usually cost a small fortune.\n\nDiscounted tickets weren't unheard of, but usually came with lots of strings attached, such as having to spend a certain number of nights at the destination.\n\nInternational routes were usually operated by the flag carriers of the countries involved, who would take a gentlemanly approach to competition and fare-setting.\n\nDeregulation -- a global liberalization trend which began with the US Deregulation Act of 1978 -- swept everything before it, from the industry structure to the way we think about air travel and airline fares.\n\nFiercely competitive\n\nIt's now all about revenue management, says Robert W. Mann, a consultant and former airline planning executive.\n\nAnd that's something, he says, has become increasingly complex and fiercely competitive in the past few decades.\n\n\"The growth of the network airline and the drop in the cost of computing has brought revenue management to whole new levels of sophistication,\" he tells CNN.\n\n\"Techniques such as Expected Marginal Seat Revenue (EMSR) look at the best ways to optimize fares in real time, not only on a given route, but taking into account revenue-generating opportunities across the whole airline network\".\n\nThis is why, for example, flying from London to Dubai may cost pretty much the same as flying all the way to Manila, also via Dubai.\n\nThat's because the airline may prefer to keep seats on the London-Dubai leg for higher-value passengers that fly longer onward journeys, and will use pricing to discourage those aiming to fly shorter trips.\n\nJUST WATCHED Playing the points game: Airmiles explained Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Playing the points game: Airmiles explained 06:25\n\nCustomer profiling\n\nBut how does the airline know who the higher-value passengers are and how much to charge them?\n\nStuart Barwood, founder of Travercial, an airline consultancy firm, says airlines can make a number of reasonable assumptions about the profile of traffic on a certain route and then adjust their prices accordingly.\n\n\"The London to Majorca route, for example, has a marked leisure profile. This has implications not only for fare levels but also for the way pricing changes over time.\n\n\"If the airline assumes that leisure passengers will tend to book relatively early, months before their holidays, it may be tempted to start pricing seats on that route relatively high. It would then adjust them according to the market response.\n\n\"Meanwhile on a typical business route -- let's say London to Frankfurt -- the airline may start with low prices to fill a minimum of capacity, then raise prices steeply for business travelers that book at the last minute.\"\n\nIn fact, those last-minute high-value passengers are so precious that some airlines go the extra mile to make room for them.\n\nFor example, a service developed by Barcelona-based company Caravelo helps airlines identify those passengers most likely to accept a flight swap in exchange for compensation, such as vouchers or frequent flier miles, and offers to rebook them on a later flight.\n\nWith space then cleared, the high-fare passengers are then booked onto the previously full flight.\n\nTowards total customization\n\nYou might think of fare classes in terms of economy, business and first class, but the reality is airlines have dozens of subdivisions.\n\nThe airline will adjust the number of seats allocated to each fare class. When one class has been sold, the sale price will leap to the next one.\n\nThis is how most fares are currently set, but it's still some way off from the ultimate goal: Airlines want to know their clients so well they're able to offer fully personalized pricing.\n\nLoyalty programs, registered users and cookie tracking can give airlines some valuable clues, but even when an airline has gathered a lot of data about its passengers they still might not be putting it to profitable use.\n\nAdding up the extras\n\n\"In reality, it is quite common for passenger data to be scattered throughout several functional areas within an airline, kept in data silos where it is of little use to the revenue management department,\" says Barwood.\n\nAirlines might be lagging behind the likes of Amazon when it comes to personalized marketing, but Barwood says many are getting up to speed with data management and this is already being felt in pricing and marketing.\n\nRevenue management systems will increasingly take into account not only the air fare itself, but the total value a passenger can generate for the airline, including ancillary revenue.\n\nThat's all the extras that can be added to your base fare, and it's a growing source of profit.\n\nUsing seat choice as an example, many airlines now charge for the privilege of picking your seats in advance.\n\nThis could, in theory, be managed dynamically. Why not base seat prices on the occupancy of a given flight? Or charge less to members of your loyalty program?\n\nThis kind of profiling might be beneficial to the loyalty program customer in this instance, but what about when a frequent business traveler is then consistently shown higher fares when they're trying to book a family vacation?\n\nIt could well prompt a backlash among the sort of high value customers that every airline hopes to retain.\n\nProtecting the brand\n\nJUST WATCHED The loophole letting passengers fly on the cheap Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The loophole letting passengers fly on the cheap 06:33\n\nAnd while airlines may have good reasons not to overcharge their best customers, they also have to be careful not to undercharge the other classes of client.\n\nThe temptation is to aggressively lower prices when there are still empty seats left before a flight departs -- but if this becomes the norm there's a serious risk of undermining the brand and alienating higher-value passengers.\n\nA number of companies, such as Bidflyer, Plusgrade and SeatFrog, have come up with applications that allow airlines to sell upgrades to the highest bidder through an auction mechanism -- an efficient but anonymous way to get passengers to tell the airline how much they're willing to pay for premium services.\n\nBack to basics\n\nThe apparent randomness of airfares makes for an excellent conversation topic with friends and colleagues, but it can also be a source of anxiety for many travelers.\n\nPerceptions that prices are immensely variable can add to the fear that customers may be overcharged for any extras they inadvertently purchase, or the worry that they might not be getting the best deal out there.\n\nWhich is why many airlines have opted for a different approach: go back to basics and offer branded fares -- a bundle of services for a closed price.\n\nThis shouldn't be confused with the rigid fare system that prevailed when the first low-cost airlines hit the scene.\n\nThis is more like an evolution of the low-cost fare system which lets customers choose the extras they want to add to the base fare.\n\nThis approach means re-bundling a bunch of services -- from checked-in luggage to a wider, more spacious seat --- into a number of fare package options of varying complexity, all selling for a set price.\n\nThink of it as like the menu options at a fast food joint.\n\nThe airfare arms race\n\nAirlines might have a whole battery of tools to help them extract the most revenue from their passengers, but travelers can also call on their own arsenal of technological countermeasures.\n\nCompanies such as Skyscanner and Kayak have introduced fare alerts which allow you to monitor fares for specific flights and get automated alerts the moment they change.\n\nSome companies are also developing fare prediction technology that promises to help travelers book their flights at the optimal moment, when the fare is likely to be lower.\n\nIn order to do this they rely on their own algorithms, plus a heap of historical data on air fares.\n\nCalifornia-based FLYR uses its own proprietary fare prediction technology to offer fare lock-in insurance in partnership with TripAdvisor.\n\nThis service is similar to buying a financial option where you pay a relatively small premium in advance, to make sure you won't pay more than a certain amount at a later date.\n\nIt also works with travel agents and other distribution partners to optimize bookings.\n\nSeizing the moment\n\nFLYR's founder, Dutch entrepreneur Alexander Mans, says that outside a 30-day window of a flight's date of departure, there is a 60 to 70% chance that a specific air fare will drop in price at some point.\n\n\"It is practically impossible for someone to monitor this manually, but with our computing resources we can predict pretty accurately the chances of a fare coming down and advise on the best course of action.\n\n\"If we think a fare is going to be lower in the future, we recommend waiting, before hitting the 'book' button.\"\n\nHopper is another company specializing in the field of airfare prediction. Its mobile app, which has been downloaded more than eight million times, uses big data technology to predict fares as much as 12 months in advance.\n\n\"Our system looks at six to eight billion air fares every day. Our database has five years of historical fares, that means trillions of prices!\" Frederic Lalonde, Hopper's founder and CEO, declares proudly.\n\nHe claims their algorithms are capable of accurately predicting an airfare within $5, up to six months before departure.\n\n\"We are confident enough in our system to predict actual figures and to tell our customers whether they are getting a good fare or not.\n\n\"We have tracked our accuracy to 95%. Whether people later follow our advice or not is another story...\"\n\nWith this amount of computing power being thrown into the field of airline pricing and the expectation that artificial intelligence technology will go mainstream, it might ultimately be up to the robots to fight the airfare war.\n\nThis isn't necessarily bad news -- it may result in better choices and more efficient booking processes.\n\nWith virtually millions of different air fares -- as many as the number of passengers airlines carry every year -- what seems assured is that airline fares will continue to be a topic of conversation by the office cooler for years to come.",

    "text": "Michael Kugelman is senior associate for South and Southeast Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.\n\n(CNN) It's safe to say that India-Pakistan relations are nearly on a war footing.\n\nSaber rattling has been near constant in recent weeks after terrorists -- from Pakistan, according to India -- stormed an Indian military base in India-controlled Kashmir and killed 18 soldiers . India's home minister denounced Pakistan as a \"terrorist state.\" Pakistan's defense minister threatened nuclear war.\n\nThen came Thursday, when India claimed to have carried out a \"surgical strike\" across the border into Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. The operation, according to the Indian government and military , targeted terrorist \"launch pads\" and killed several dozen militants. New Delhi's detailed (and perhaps exaggerated) account said the operation lasted four hours. If true, it arguably would have been the most audacious incursion onto Pakistani soil since US Special Forces stormed Osama Bin Laden's compound.\n\nPakistan angrily denied that this strike had happened, contending that India had merely engaged in cross-border firing (killing two Pakistani troops) -- a frequent occurrence on the volatile frontier. Pakistan nonetheless vowed to undertake a \"forceful response\" if such an incident occurred again. India has evacuated villagers from several border areas in anticipation of possible Pakistani retaliation.\n\nWith both sides banging the war drums, it may be tempting to fear that all-out conflict isn't far away.\n\nThe good news, however, is that a hot war between the nuclear-armed nemeses remains an unlikely prospect.\n\nNukes are often cited as the chief deterrent to all-out war, and for good reason.\n\nPakistan refuses to adopt a no first-use policy, which means it could hypothetically respond to India's use of conventional military force with a nuclear strike. This is no empty threat. Pakistan, according to estimates from experts in August, has between 110 and 130 nuclear warheads and is described as boasting \" the world's fastest-growing nuclear stockpile. \" Most critically, it is emphasizing the production of tactical nuclear weapons, which are meant for actual battlefield use.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, boasts about 100 to 120 nuclear warheads . It has no known plans to develop tactical nukes. And it has adopted a strict no first-use policy.\n\nLast year, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhary stated explicitly that his country could use tactical nukes as a response to India's Cold Start doctrine -- a strategy (albeit one not yet formally incorporated into Indian military doctrine) that calls for limited conventional uses of force in Pakistan.\n\nChaudhary's announcement suggested that India would not need to go far to run up against Pakistan's nuclear red lines. The implication was that even the limited use of force could trigger a Pakistani nuclear response.\n\nAnd yet India's cross-border strike Thursday suggests that India has more room to maneuver under the nuclear umbrella than Pakistan's threats may suggest. Additionally, as Shashank Joshi recently noted , India staged limited cross-border raids in the 2000s. These did not elicit threats of a Pakistani nuclear response. (Pakistan became a declared nuclear weapons state in 1999.)\n\nIn this sense, Pakistan's nuclear weapons aren't as much of a deterrent as it may suggest. India could likely get away with additional cross-border incursions that target Pakistani terrorists, with possible retaliations from Pakistan that may include mobilizing more troops along the border and, perhaps, limited conventional strikes in India. (If India were to hit Pakistani soldiers instead of militants, Pakistan's chances of a robust response would increase.)\n\nNew Delhi's no first-use policy means that Pakistan could exercise limited force in India without having to worry about an Indian nuclear response. However, for Pakistan, a safer and more likely step would be simply sit to back and let the anti-India terror groups on its soil carry out more attacks in India.\n\nJUST WATCHED Army base attack leaves 17 Indian soldiers dead Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Army base attack leaves 17 Indian soldiers dead 03:52\n\nAll of this could safely happen under the nuclear umbrella.\n\nAdditionally, there are reasons other than nukes that limit prospects for a hot war.\n\nFirst, Thursday's strike was not as escalatory as the jingoistic rhetoric in India may have suggested; New Delhi described it as a one-off operation to pre-emptively avert terror attacks in India.\n\nSecond, Washington is likely working the phones with its interlocutors in Islamabad to urge restraint. Pakistan won't want to risk further aid and arms cutbacks from Washington that could be imposed if it retaliated militarily in a big way.\n\nThird, operational incapacities within India's armed forces and the inferiority of Pakistan's conventional forces to India's (in terms of pure numbers) constrain military options on both sides.\n\nThe uptake? Nukes don't deter all conflict on the subcontinent, but they do minimize the prospects of major war. Meanwhile, non-nuclear factors give reason for hope that the region will be spared the heavy bloodshed threatened amid all the bluster of recent days.",

    "text": "Gideon Levy is a columnist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. He has covered the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for 25 years. He wrote a column in Haaretz this week with similar themes to those in the article below. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his.\n\n(CNN) Shimon Peres , the ninth President of Israel, who died this week at 93 , personified the acceptable, kind face of Israel. It was a face, however, that wore a mask -- or at the very least a heavy layer of makeup.\n\nFor many years, Peres enabled Israel to continue its policy of occupation -- a policy at odds with his claims of striving for peace and making efforts to end Israeli occupation.\n\nPlaced next to his positive contributions to the security and construction of Israel, this record leaves a stain on his legacy.\n\nPeres, the kind Israeli in the eyes of the world, provided legitimacy for Israel from the international community at a time when it was an outcast. But he also allowed Israel to go ahead with the occupations. He allowed it to build more settlements while simultaneously claiming that it was striving for peace.\n\nGideon Levy\n\nBoth Israelis and the rest of the world loved Peres. Israelis loved him because he allowed them to feel better about themselves. The world loved Peres because he gave it hope that Israel could be different. He also absolved it from the responsibility of having to do something about Israel's occupation. The world told itself that it could trust Peres to do this. But he never did. And nor did he ever seriously intend to.\n\nWho, or what, could possibly be more Israeli than Shimon Peres? Back when Israel wanted to give the impression that it was a country of peace, it had Peres. But that was a different Israel. In 2016, Benjamin Netanyahu represents the modern Israeli . Peres may only have recently died, but his Israel died long before him.\n\nHis Israel was an Israel of tremendous achievements but also of shadows and lies. It's impossible to talk about Peres's legacy without also describing the country he leaves behind.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama: I am honored to be here to say farwell Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama: I am honored to be here to say farwell 01:30\n\nIf Peres was really a champion of peace, then surely Israel would now be a country of peace. But is there anybody in the world who accepts that today? If Israel is standing on the edge of a moral abyss, Peres is partially responsible. If it is an apartheid country, then he is its founding partner.\n\nThe heads of state attending his funeral praised his contribution to peace. But what peace? This is the man who was part of an Israeli government that brought the Dimona reactor , planned the 1956 war and the first Israeli settlements.\n\nEven his greatest achievement -- the Oslo accords that he signed together with Yitzhak Rabin on behalf of Israel, for which both men were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize -- has left a mark on the world more complicated than many are prepared to admit. The accords totally ignored Israeli settlements and did not bring about Israel withdrawing from a single one of them.\n\nJUST WATCHED People were 'led to think' Olso meant peace Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH People were 'led to think' Olso meant peace 07:24\n\nYes, he was an impressive man. Few politicians have ever talked about peace in quite the way that Peres did.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, Peres was saying in virtually every speech: \"It's impossible to rule over another people against its will.\" But if he believed this to be so, why did he do so little to end Israeli occupation?\n\nOf course, he wanted peace. But when we talk about Peres's legacy, we must be honest with ourselves: He never treated the Palestinians as equals to Jews. Human rights and international law were of no interest to him. Clearly, Palestinian suffering did not move his heart.\n\nIt's so nice to praise Peres: He was the hero of the Israelis who feigned peace and wished justness. Now, there's no one left to at least try to feign it.",

It would be terrible for any of the ideas of limited government. I'm still not sure that Donald Trump is for limited government, for balanced budgets. One of the biggest things that he's been for in his last several years is using eminent domain for the government to take private property from one property - private property owner and give it to himself for his casinos and parking lots. That's not a conservative notion. And, really, most of Donald Trump is nothing more than sort of bits of populism, but no consistent conservative philosophy.\u201d\n\nPaul responds to Cruz\u2019s immigration stance: \u201cI think, on several things, he wants to have it both ways. On immigration, at the time, he supported an amendment that said, OK, we're not going to get citizenship, but we will allow illegal status. And he wanted the bill to pass. In fact, I was in the same category. I thought citizenship was too far, but the compromise would no citizenship, but give people a legal status. That's what Cruz was for. He was - he's been explicit about it. And now he says never and that he never did it. And so I think he should just admit that he changed his mind, that he used to be for legalization, but he's not anymore. But he's done the same thing\u2026 So, I think, on a number of issues, he wants to have it both ways, depending on which audience he's talking to.\u201d\n\nPaul reacts to criticism from Rubio: \u201cWell, you know, the difference between Marco Rubio and I is, I show up for work. He's missed about a third to a half of his votes this year. And we had the biggest vote of the whole year, voting on a trillion dollars worth of spending, and he didn't show up. So, yes, I think he ought to resign or give his pay back to the taxpayer.\n\nPaul on the status of his campaign: But, as far as I'm concerned, yes, I do need to do well in the early primaries. We're - we're in it to win it. We're not in it just to mess around. I'm not in it to place in the lower tier. If we're in the lower tier, obviously, we will reassess. But we don't plan to be. We have got a campaign that we think is going to shock people. And we're hoping that when we get done with this campaign and people see the votes happen, that we will begin discounting the pollsters, who, I think, have no clue as to what is going on in America.\u201d\n\nFULL POST",

    "text": "(CNN) Everything you think you know about the \"future of war\" is wrong.\n\nAn elite consensus on the \"New Way of War\" has been emerging for some time now. Among defense policy experts, think tanks, echoed at Aspen and Davos, the way forward seems clear. The future belongs to cyberwarfare and includes a terrorism problem that will be dealt with by drones and SEALs, and the need to be prepared for the possibility, however remote, of a large-scale naval and aviation campaign in the Far East against a rising China.\n\nThis new American way of war\u2014clean, precise, and (unless things go very bad with China) low-casualty -- seems to capture the persistent technologist mood of America.\n\nUnfortunately, reality seems uninterested in conforming to this strongly held belief. We see instead the future of warfare unfolding in a very different way: as the Israelis struggle against a well-trained and organized resistance movement, Hamas, in Gaza; as ISIS fights against not only the Arab Iraqis and Syrians, but also in Iraqi Kurdistan, Lebanon and even Jordan; while in the Ukraine, we see local separatists being either assisted, or used as \"useful idiots,\" by the forces of President Vladimir Putin's Russia. In short, these are not the wars we were anticipating.\n\nAnd yet here they are. So what are some common characteristics of these wars? And how should the United States respond to this new reality?\n\nPhotos: The ISIS terror threat Photos: The ISIS terror threat Wounded passengers are treated following a suicide bombing at the Brussels Airport on March 22, 2016.

Hide Caption 49 of 49\n\nThis is \"war amongst the people,\" with all the messiness, ambiguity, byzantine relationships and background noise associated with a population center. Much of the combat will occur in cities (warfare has urbanized along with the population), but in more rural areas, towns and villages will still be important.\n\nFinally, they occur outside the bounds of normal nation-state conflict\n\nGaza isn't really a state and both Ukrainian separatists and ISIS, respectively, have stripped Kiev and Baghdad of effective control of the territory they operate within. This is not to say that state boundaries are unimportant, because they are (that Iraq has invited airstrikes against ISIS, while Syria has not, is a key differentiator), but that they are of lesser importance. But many to most future conflicts will occur in these spaces that belong to no state, or only tenuously to a state.\n\nDouglas A. Ollivant\n\nThe United States has a lamentable tendency to \"mirror image\" its rivals. In this thinking, because we spend significant time and resources developing viruses to disable Iranian centrifuges, our enemies must be making parallel efforts. And perhaps they are. But to date, what we have seen (in Georgia, Ukraine and Iraq alike) is a much simpler approach to cyberwarfare \u2014 the distributed denial of service attack.\n\nThis is, as many readers will know, the \"brute force\" form of cyberattack, overwhelming a network by sending an excessive amount of data to the target, effectively consuming available resources and leaving none for legitimate connections. While there is some art in getting the machines arrayed to attack (or in outsourcing it to cybergangs), the attack itself is just one of mass. So yes, it's cyberwarfare, but of the most primitive and least technical kind.\n\nExpect more crises\n\nPhotos: Fighting Boko Haram in Cameroon Photos: Fighting Boko Haram in Cameroon Cameroonian forces are seen in Mabass, a village in northern Cameroon that overlooks a Boko Haram base in Madagali, Nigeria.

Some will occur in areas where key U.S. interests are at stake. Others will happen on the periphery of U.S. national interest. But they will continue to tend to involve well-trained cadres, in contact with the population, and in areas without strong state control. In short, these combats will be remarkably ambiguous.\n\nAllies may be in constant flux (for example, are the Sunni tribes facilitating ISIS or hoping for support in fighting them? The answer to both seems to be \"yes.\") and enemies may well melt into the population (a phenomenon that veterans of both Iraq and Afghanistan are quite familiar with). This will require remarkable flexibility from all involved, from the rifle squad to the National Security Council staff.\n\nSo what can the United States do to face an enemy that will not conform to our desires \u2014 that does not lend itself to the capabilities of Joint Special Operations Command or Cyber Command or the Seventh Fleet?\n\nHow to buy hardware\n\nFirst, we need to rethink the way we go about buying our military hardware. Are we seeking to buy weapons that can face a near-peer opponent, or ones that will retain their utility against a trained, but lower-technology land-based opponent?\n\nFor example, one can question the utility of U.S. aircraft carriers in the South China Sea in a missile-rich environment. But the USS George H.W. Bush has been a very useful power-projection platform to launch F-18s for strikes against ISIS in Iraq, which thankfully has neither ground to sea missiles nor attack aircraft, to date.\n\nJUST WATCHED NSA chief: New blind spots in tracking terrorists Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NSA chief: New blind spots in tracking terrorists 02:09\n\nFurther, acquisition strategies must be retooled for the modern age. The debacles of both the F-35 aircraft and the Army's Distributed Common Ground System intelligence architecture are well documented. Cost over-runs have been coupled with performance shortfalls in both systems. While some human error and contractor misconduct may be involved, the bulk of the issues here are structural, and statutory.\n\nThe way that the United States does contracting \u2014 more concerned about being \"fair\" than getting the best product for the defense dollar \u2014 may have worked for producing lower-technology items, but falls far short for more complex weapons systems.\n\nRise of the 'Green Berets'\n\nSecond, we need to promote our forces who work best with allied forces in these spaces where the state is weak or nonexistent: the Army's Special Forces (popularly known as \"Green Berets\"). These forces have undergone significant neglect in the past decade, as the anti-terrorism capabilities of Joint Special Operations Command (SEAL Team Six and Delta Force) were seen as the most pressing need.\n\nIn both Iraq and Afghanistan, Special Forces teams were known to be tasked by their commands \u2014 or decide on their own \u2014 to pursue a more aggressive \"kill and capture\" mission, rather than work \"by, with, and through\" their indigenous partners. It will require cultural change (and likely an improved funding stream) inside the military to emphasize that these Special Forces teams \u2014 seen as considerably less glamorous than their Joint Special Operations Command counterparts \u2014 are the capability most needed for future warfare.\n\nThird, we need to continue to focus on prepared and ready land power \u2014 our own rifle squads, companies and battalions who can do the dirty business themselves, if need be. Some of these situations may lend themselves to the use of indigenous land power (someone else's soldiers) supported by U.S. airpower (n.b. The USAF should be tasked to retain the capability to provide exactly this support). This will continue to be the preferred technique. But for in extremis situations, the United States must continue to have a reliable, well-trained, well-led and well-equipped ground force. Of these, training and leadership remain the most important. This is fortunate, as our technological advantage, particularly at the individual soldier and small-unit level, may be fleeting.\n\nCommercial products (e.g. those supporting extreme sports) will be available to any international buyer, and many of these may give an edge to America's adversaries in the close fight. It will continue to be \u2014 as it ever was \u2014 difficult and realistic training under competent, seasoned leadership that will give U.S. land power its critical edge.\n\nDecentralize information\n\nFourth, the Pentagon should focus on systems that push power and information to the \"edge\" of the system. We have lived in an age of extreme centralization of information. This has worked out only because the force of choice for the last decade, the SEALs and Deltas of Joint Special Operations Command, are considered a \"national asset\" and therefore have had access to this centralized information.\n\nThe forces of choice for the future, rifle companies and Special Forces detachments, will not be privileged with this access. We should think about systems that push information to their level. This may mean that forces at this level must be empowered to gather such information for themselves. For example, future warfare may privilege a force that has a UAV/drone that downloads the information directly to the user on the ground, rather than a UAV/drone that sends it to a central repository, and only secondarily to field users.\n\nFifth, many observers have pointed out that the military's traditional personnel management system has defects, both in recruiting and development. There are a host of suggestions, but any proposal that increases flexibility and expands the talent pool without degrading the necessity of producing leaders who can lead young men into combat should be seriously considered.\n\nLong-standing suggestions to increase language training, allow for late entry and/or sabbaticals, increase technical skills, get input from subordinates on their leaders, and recruit outside traditional pools -- for instance, in Silicon Valley -- should all be seriously considered. All will be necessary for these coming ambiguous fights.\n\nHow war won't change\n\nFinally, we need to regard with extreme skepticism those who believe that warfare has fundamentally changed in any real way. Yes, cyberwarfare has the potential to be real, but primarily to disrupt communications or perhaps sabotage infrastructure.\n\nLet's be clear, it is a new capability that must be integrated into warfare, as was the combustion engine and the radio. But it doesn't fundamentally shift what war is and will be. Warfare has absorbed far more earth-shaking developments (airpower and nuclear weapons) without changing its fundamental character.\n\nWar will continue to be fought over issues of fear, honor and interest. Despite increasing automation, it will be fought primarily by young men (despite the increasing presence of older men and young women). The next war will likely be very recognizable to someone who fought in one millennia ago.\n\nIt is possible that our next war will resemble nothing that anyone has predicted, perhaps a naval battle over the Arctic, or \u2014 God forbid \u2014 a nuclear exchange. And yes, it is possible that war could emerge between China on one side and South Korea, Japan or even the United States on the other in the South China Sea, though it is not overstatement to claim that this would bring about the end of the world economy as we currently understand it. But the most likely outcome, barring some shock to the world system, is that future wars will strongly resemble those occurring today.",

Surfing up in Northern California is pretty much surfing in shark-infested cold water, so we knew they were out there.\n\n\ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f A photo posted by Michael Muller (@michaelmuller7) on Sep 1, 2016 at 7:33pm PDT\n\nWhen did you realize this was a subject you wanted to pursue seriously?\n\nI sat on a boat one night in the Galapagos, and I had this fulfillment shooting these animals -- shooting underwater with these lights and doing what I was doing -- that I hadn't really felt doing my commercial work. Even though I was shooting a watch campaign, there was a bigger cause behind it.\n\nI've sold $10 billion dollars in movie posters and Nike shoes and this and that; maybe I can help sell this planet and these animals that most people haven't seen before.\n\nHow do you get the sharks to pose for you?\n\nIf we're not chumming in the water, the sharks aren't even going to be there. They're either skittish about us, afraid of us, or have no interest in us, so for me to photograph the sharks, we have to bring the chum into the water and feed them.\n\nIs anyone else out there as excited for 007 SPECTRE as I am? God I love those films, and Daniel Craig crushes it as BOND. There is not many of us that can say I shot James Bond a couple of times. I shot 007.......of course he walked away from me unharmed. I am gonna sit with that thought for a moment. #SPECTRE #007 #danielcraig #bond #mullerphoto #mullerphotoapp A photo posted by Michael Muller (@michaelmuller7) on Oct 13, 2015 at 5:12pm PDT\n\nHow does an underwater shark shoot differ from working with celebrities?\n\nThey're just like people. They have a body language. We can very easily tell when there's one that's aggressive. I've been taught how to handle myself if they are aggressive and it certainly comes down to you becoming the predator. So you can't have a fear when you're down there.\n\nThat said, I can't really direct the sharks. I have a very small amount of control -- maybe where I put the food, where I set my light, where I position myself.\n\nOther than that, I can't tell the shark 'Hey, time to raise your dorsal fin,' whereas with people, when they step on the mark, for the most part I am directing them, telling them where to look, what to do, or collaborating with them. The amazing ones, we collaborate together. They bring to the table an experience, but for the most part I'm directing them.\n\nIt's also real quiet underwater, and not so quiet on photo shoots.\n\nIt is 100% sweater weather. I really enjoyed working on this campaign for @deadpoolmovie A photo posted by Michael Muller (@michaelmuller7) on Dec 19, 2015 at 2:34pm PST\n\nHow has shooting sharks impacted the way you work with your human subjects?\n\nFor me, when you're looking at a 16-18 foot great white shark, the power, the perfection of evolution at that... I sort of look at people and -- even in my field -- I'm not really impressed. I don't put people up on pedestals anymore. We all share the same sun.",

It is a joke about 'new Russians'.\"\n\nProducer Evgeny Fridlyand told state news agency Russia 24 that Williams was trying to cash in on Russia's constant presence in international news headlines with the track.\n\n\"Lots of artists have used Russian classical music and the theme of Russia,\" he said. \"We are currently at a time when Russia is 'newsmaker number one,' and it seems Robbie Williams has tried to increase his popularity with this.\"\n\nSinger: Why not joke about it?\n\nBut others were not troubled by the song. Russian singer Yuri Loza, speaking to the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, said it should be fine for foreigners to mock the country's oligarchs, just as Russians themselves have.\n\n\"Why is it that when we talk and joke about this, it is OK?\" he said. \"Why should others also not joke about it? We also have a load of specific humor about all of our oligarchs, about our crazy money.\"\n\nWilliams: Song is not about Putin\n\nThe track's opening lyrics also have prompted speculation that it's targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe song, sung from the perspective of a \"modern Rasputin,\" begins: \"It takes a certain kind of man with a certain reputation / To alleviate the cash from a whole entire nation / Take my loose change and build my own space station.\"\n\nBut Williams, who rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of British boy band Take That, dismissed a UK newspaper's claim that it mocked the Russian leader.\n\n\"This song is definitely not about Mr Putin,\" he tweeted.\n\nI love you Dan but this song is definitely not about Mr Putin xhttps://t.co/ViIACar1Z4 \u2014 Robbie Williams (@robbiewilliams) September 30, 2016",

    "text": "(CNN) Five artworks from the Dutch Golden Age are finally returning to their rightful place, more than a decade after they disappeared into the shadowy depths of the illicit art market.\n\nThe works belong to the Westfries Museum , located in the Dutch maritime town of Hoorn, where they will be unveiled on October 7 -- a far cry from Ukraine, where the paintings were uncovered.\n\nA new deal\n\nIn January 2005, thieves are thought to have hidden inside a coffin on display inside the museum before disabling the security system and taking off with 24 paintings and 70 pieces of silverware. It was the bulk of the museum's 17th and 18th century collection, worth approximately 1.3 million euros ($1.45 million).\n\nWith no solid leads, it was feared the paintings would never be traced. But in July 2015, the museum's director, Ad Geerdink, received word that someone from a Ukrainian militia force, a man named Borys Humeniuk, had made contact with the Dutch embassy in Kiev.\n\nA deputy commander from the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Humeniuk claimed to have found the paintings, and said he was willing to hand them over.\n\n\"He said his battalion had found all 24 painting in a villa belonging to former president Viktor Yanukovych while fighting Russian separatists in the east of the country,\" claimed Geerdink.\n\nPhotos: Notorious art heists In 1911, Leonardo Da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" was stolen from the Louvre by an Italian who had been a handyman for the museum. The famous painting was recovered two years later. Hide Caption 1 of 13 Photos: Notorious art heists A statue called \"Young Girl with Serpent\" by Auguste Rodin was stolen from a home in Beverly Hills, California, in 1991. It was returned after someone offered it on consignment to Christie's auction house. Rodin, a French sculptor considered by some aficionados to have been the father of modern sculpture, lived from 1840 until 1917. His most famous work, \"The Thinker,\" shows a seated man with his chin on his hand. Hide Caption 2 of 13 Photos: Notorious art heists Picasso's \"La Coiffeuse\" (\"The Hairdresser\") was discovered missing in 2001 and was recovered when it was shipped from Belgium to the United States in December 2014. The shipper said it was a $37 piece of art being sent to the United States as a Christmas present. The feds say it was actually a stolen Picasso, missing for more than a decade and worth millions of dollars. Hide Caption 3 of 13 Photos: Notorious art heists Italy's Culture Ministry unveils two paintings by the French artists Paul Gauguin and Pierre Bonnard on April 2, 2014. The paintings, worth millions of euros , were stolen from a family house in London in 1970, abandoned on a train and then later sold at a lost-property auction, where a factory worker paid 45,000 Italian lire for them -- roughly equivalent to 22 euros ($30). Hide Caption 4 of 13 Photos: Notorious art heists A Renoir painting finished in the 1800s, loaned to a museum, reported stolen in 1951 and then bought at a flea market in 2010 has to be returned to the museum, a judge ruled on January 10, 2014. The 5\u00bd-by-9-inch painting, titled \"Landscape on the Banks of the Seine,\" was bought for $7 at a flea market by a Virginia woman. The estimated value is between $75,000 and $100,000.

Works by Gauguin and Meyer de Haan were also taken.

Hide Caption 10 of 13 Photos: Notorious art heists Many works of art that were taken by the Nazis were never recovered.

Hide Caption 13 of 13\n\nIt was now a question of what Humeniuk wanted in return. At this point, the museum enlisted the help of Dutch art historian and art crime investigator Arthur Brand.\n\nFrom the start Brand knew the issue would be money.\n\n\"If you have stolen paintings in your possession, of course you can ask for a reward,\" said Brand. \"But if you ask, you have to accept the reward that is there. If you do not, then you're engaging in a criminal act.\"\n\nMeeting in Kiev -- and armed with official valuations -- Brand told Humeniuk that in its badly damaged state, the entire collection was worth not millions, but around 500,000 euros ($560,000), and offered a finders fee of 50,000 euros ($56,000).\n\n\"Humeniuk said he would talk with his soldiers, but I saw in his eyes that it was the end of any deal,\" said Brand.\n\nAn illegal art market\n\nWith 15 years of experience in the illicit art trade, not much surprises Brand anymore. He's recovered well over 200 works of art, including ancient Aztec artifacts, antique porcelain plates and numerous paintings looted by the Nazis.\n\nIn one of his most high profile cases, Brand aided German police in the retrieval of a pair of bronze horse sculptures by Josef Thorak that once belonged to Adolf Hitler.\n\nAccording to Interpol, it's almost impossible to put a financial figure on the illicit art trade, although the FBI and the US Department of Justice have called it the third highest-grossing criminal trade in the world after drugs and arms.\n\nBrand himself estimates the illegal art market's value to be around 8 billion euros ($8.9 billion) a year.\n\nWestfries Museum director Ad Geerdink, pictured next to the painting \"Lady World\" in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\n\"The amount of illegal activity in the art world is horrible, and I believe 30 percent of what is being offered is fake,\" he said.\n\nDespite this, Brand often finds criminals in possession of stolen art works are just as keen to be rid of them as he is to retrieve them.\n\n\"In many cases, the art is used as a payment or as security in the criminal world and pieces get passed around, changing hands frequently,\" said Brand.\n\n\"If criminals get caught with these stolen goods, they will be arrested and face jail time. (The artworks are) evidence, so often they're destroyed. We've seen this happen many times.\"\n\nIn one of his most recent cases, Brand helped recover a Salvador Dali and a Tamara de Lempicka stolen from the now-closed Dutch Scheringa Museum of Realist Art in 2009. He says the paintings changed hands three times in the eight months he was on the case,\n\n\"It's not good for the paintings. They get damaged and, secondly, it's almost impossible to work out who the original thieves are. Just forget about finding the original thieves and concentrate on getting the paintings back.\"\n\nRepatriated paintings\n\nBack in Ukraine, the fear for the Dutch paintings was not destruction, but yet another change of hands, with some of the paintings being offered for sale on the black market.\n\nIn April 2016, after notifying Dutch police and the Ukrainian authorities, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin announced the recovery of four paintings in a special operation by the Ukrainian Security Service. A week later, thanks to one of Brand's Ukrainian sources, a fifth painting was also unearthed.\n\nWhile only five of the 24 paintings have been retrieved, Brand says he's confident the remaining 19 paintings will eventually be returned.\n\n\"We will get them back, sooner or later. They cannot sell them anymore; the images have been seen from New York to Japan, and we're on their track. We won't give up.\"\n\nBack in Hoorn, the town is eagerly awaiting their return.\n\n\"We are very emotional about this theft,\" says museum director Ad Geerdink. \"A part of our history was stolen, a part of our cultural heritage. Now five lost sons of Hoorn will return, and it's going to be a very special day.\"",

It is - it's about, on one end, being very creative and almost being an idea person and seeing ideas and interesting ways of doing things everywhere. But on the other side, it's about being very, very analytical and very, very dedicated to details. I like to say god is in the details. So if you're analytical and logical, almost like a machine, I'm a computer engineering - well, I went to school as a computer engineer, but bringing a creative idea and ideation piece to that, put them together, you're now a creative problem-solver.

    "text": "Washington (CNN) A government contractor was arrested in August for allegedly stealing top secret intelligence, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, was charged with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor after searches of his home and property revealed hard-copy and digital files containing \"highly classified information.\"\n\nMartin worked at Booz Allen Hamilton as a contractor to the National Security Agency, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nThe files allegedly obtained by Martin contained top secret information, the complaint said. Top secret is the highest level of government classification and is defined by the government as material that if disclosed \"reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.\"\n\nAmong the documents the FBI believes Martin stole were some detailing a hacking tool that the NSA developed to break into computer systems in other countries. Documents detailing the tools were posted on the Internet in recent months.\n\nFBI investigators haven't concluded what Martin's motivation for stealing the documents. But so far they don't believe he did it for a foreign country.\n\n'Mere allegations'\n\nIn a statement, Booz Allen did not refer to Martin by name but acknowledged one of its employees had been arrested. The company said it has offered its \"total cooperation\" to authorities and fired Martin.\n\n\"There have been no material changes to our client engagements as a result of this matter,\" the company said. \"Booz Allen is a 102-year-old company, and the alleged conduct does not reflect our core values. Thousands of our employees support critical client missions with dedication and excellence each day. Their professionalism, values and ethics are what define our firm.\"\n\nMartin's attorneys, Deborah Boardman and James Wyda, said in a joint statement that the charges are \"mere allegations.\"\n\n\"We have not yet seen any evidence,\" the attorneys said. \"There is no evidence that Hal Martin betrayed his country. What we do know is that Mr. Martin loves his family and America, he served his nation honorably in the US Navy as a lieutenant and has devoted his entire career to making America safe. We look forward to defending Hal Martin in court.\"\n\nMartin's wife said outside their Glen Burnie, Maryland, home that her husband is a \"good man\" and asked for privacy.\n\n\"I love him very much,\" Debbie Martin said.\n\nMartin served in the US Navy and Naval Reserves for more than 10 years, reaching the rank of lieutenant, according to his service record obtained by CNN. He received several awards and distinctions, including the Joint Meritorious Unit Award and Navy Unit Commendation.\n\nThe New York Times was the first to report the arrest.\n\nMartin was arrested in late August, according to the Justice Department. No explanation was given for why his arrest was not announced until Wednesday. Martin has been detained since his arrest, but has not been formally indicted yet.\n\nMurray Bennett, a neighbor of Martin's, told CNN that Martin's arrest was conducted by heavily armed FBI agents, some of whom had camouflage uniforms, helmets and guns drawn as they ran across his yard.\n\n\"It was like the third World War had started,\" said Bennett, who added that Martin was a \"good guy.\"\n\nMartin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property, according to the complaint.\n\nAssistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin was speaking at a conference in Boston Wednesday when the news broke and confirmed the arrest. He wouldn't get into details, but said it highlights the risk of insider threats.\n\n\"We have made an arrest of an individual who's involved in taking classified information,\" Carlin said, saying it shows concerns beyond external hackers in systems. \"We also need to take into account -- whether it's economic espionage or traditional espionage -- the focus on those who are trusted within our companies, within our government who can exploit that trust to cause enormous harm.\"\n\nNo known connection with Snowden\n\nEdward Snowden famously disclosed a number of NSA surveillance techniques and fled the country in 2013. He also worked for Booz Allen, though there is no known connection between Snowden and Martin.\n\nSnowden speculated on Twitter that Martin's arrest could be linked to a leak of NSA secrets.\n\n\"This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?\" Snowden wrote.\n\nThis is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products? https://t.co/otgOwB5efm \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) October 5, 2016\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama \"takes quite seriously\" the potential theft of top secret intelligence by a government contractor.\n\nThe revelation was a \"good reminder for all of us with security clearances about how important it is for us to protect sensitive national security information,\" Earnest said.\n\nHe added that he was \"sharply limited\" in what he could say about the case since a criminal investigation is ongoing.\n\nNews of Martin's arrest follows the August release of what appeared to be top secret computer code that the NSA had used to target the computers of other governments and actors, though there is no known connection between the two incidents.\n\nThat release, by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, was of code that dated back to around 2013, according to James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The documents were posted for sale online.\n\nAt the time, it raised the prospect that the world's pre-eminent cyberspying agency had itself been hacked.",

He referred to the pressing political question of the moment: Will Joe Biden challenge Hillary Clinton and others in the ongoing Democratic primary?\n\nA lot hung on his answer, and the whole nation leaned forward to listen.\n\nBiden was shockingly frank for a man under the klieg lights. His face was extremely mobile, with a range of emotion flickering as he dipped his eyes to the floor and seemed to wince. A vast audience saw the obvious truth: Here is father grieving for beloved son, Beau, who died of brain cancer only a few months ago. The rawness of his feelings were vividly on display.\n\nBiden was frank, saying: \"I don't think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, number two, they can look at folks out there and say, 'I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this.\" One could hear a pin drop in the audience, which held its breath. \"And I'd be lying if I said that I knew I was there,\" Biden added, more or less putting the kibosh on a presidential bid.\n\nPhotos: Photos: Vice President Joe Biden U.S. Vice President Joe Biden began his career in politics in 1972, winning election to the Senate at the age of 29 (he was 30 when he took office).

Voters would genuinely have to wonder if Biden really had the heart, the energy and the passion to give to this difficult and demanding job. Running for high public office can't be easy. And it's clear that even Joe doesn't think he can manage it in the wake of his son's death.\n\nIt's easy to say why so many like Joe Biden a great deal. I'm among them. He's a compassionate human being, and he's real.\n\nBorn in 1942, he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- the lunch-pail capital of the western world, in my view. I grew up only a mile or so from Biden, whose father scraped to find work during some hard economic times in this era, when anthracite mining had died out and left many in northeastern Pennsylvania without other options for making a living. My mother, who died at 97 only last year, was a friend of Biden's aunt and mother, and she recalled that they moved to Delaware in search of better work.\n\nJUST WATCHED Biden unsure if he's 'there' for a run Replay More Videos ...

He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth -- like Jeb Bush or Donald Trump. He made his way -- slowly but surely -- in the often clamorous world of American politics. And he has risen to a height his family could scarcely have imagined in those hardscrabble years after the war in Scranton.\n\nJoe is the real deal. He would have made a great president, perhaps: a man of the people, who understands their needs, their fondest wishes, their fears. But that probably isn't going to happen.\n\nNonetheless, Joe Biden has -- unexpectedly -- wakened a nation to what it craves: a vulnerable but fully committed person who can say what he or she means, without bombast or equivocation, and lead us forward.",

He is the author of \" Fair Not Flat: How to Make the Tax System Better and Simpler .\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) The revelation by the New York Times that Donald J. Trump was showing a tax loss on his 1995 tax returns of nearly $1 billion is stunning.\n\nAs a tax lawyer, academic and commentator, I have a pretty good sense of what is coming: a few articles, some denials and retorts-- including one from Trump that came after the story appeared--and lots of complexity from talking heads.\n\nTrue believers in Trump will come away still convinced of their great leader's genius and acumen. Hillary Clinton's followers will fume that yet another piece of evidence showing their opponent is a selfish, unprincipled con artist has come forth without finally ending this thing.\n\nThe rest of us -- and the remaining undecideds -- will come away confused, in large part because stories about billion-dollar tax breaks tend to be confusing.\n\nHere, then, are a few simple points:\n\n\u2022 A $916 million tax loss is a big deal. It means that Trump could have earned income of almost a billion dollars over a period of up to 15 years after 1995 without paying any federal income tax. Nice work if you can get it. Trump got it.\n\n\u2022 It is wrong to assume that Trump's nearly billion-dollar loss came from his own money. Trump is the self-proclaimed \"king of debt.\" Much of sophisticated tax planning has always involved getting tax breaks from \"other people's money,\" a phrase of which Trump is fond. Banks, other lenders or investors could well have put up the money generating the losses that Trump is claiming on his own tax returns.\n\n\u2022 To truly understand the underlying source of the tax loss, we would have to see Trump's tax returns. It is certainly fair to assume that the loss came largely from other people's money, and fair for us to expect Trump to rebut such a claim .... by showing us his tax records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump mocks Clinton's stumble Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump mocks Clinton's stumble 00:49\n\nThe argument that \"Trump is really smart, the king of tax loopholes, and that we should elect him because he alone can fix the tax system\" is extremely weak, for at least two reasons.\n\n1. There is no evidence whatsoever that Trump, himself, understands the tax laws benefiting him. The New York Times article indicates Trump's own tax accountant found him inattentive, and nothing that Trump has said in public has revealed a deep knowledge of the tax code. Trump does, on the other hand, have a frequently revealed fondness for debt, or using \"other people's money.\"\n\n2. Trump's own tax proposals would actually close down none of the remaining tax \"loopholes\" benefiting debt. Indeed, Trump's plan would greatly encourage and reward debt. Trump's impulsive last-minute decision to continue an interest loan deduction in his otherwise standard trickle-down tax du jour plan was a $1.2 trillion dollar \"whopper \" -- an expense nearly five times higher than the campaign's view of the cost of Trump's child care tax plan.\n\nTrump's continued preference for tax benefits for debt is reckless. Trump's tax policies would greatly increase taxpayer abilities to use other people's money to generate tax breaks for themselves.\n\nWhatever happens in the sea of complexity about to be sent forth, we should all remember this: A tax loss of nearly a billion dollars is a very, very nice thing to have, especially if it came from other people's money.",

It's not of those things you couldn't even believe could happen. I can't even put into words.\"\n\nJust outside Paris -- the race having relocated to Chantilly racecourse with refurbishment work ongoing at Longchamp -- it was befitting that the race win was sealed with a kiss.\n\nFrankie Dettori, bidding for a fifth Arc win, had to make do with third place on Order of St George but then promptly locked lips with a startled Moore, the on-course commentator breaking from his own language to describe it as a \"French kiss\".\n\nRyan didn't look so keen...

A year on, the four-year-old was most definitely found, making a world-class field look distinctly average as she broke for home to break a 30-year-old old record and never looked in danger of being surpassed. With that, Found's romance with the race was recaptured.\n\nThe 33-year-old Moore, who had won the Arc once before on the Michael Stoute-trained Workforce, said the O'Brien one-two-three would now go down in racing folklore.\n\n\"It's one of those unique things like Frankie's seven, Dickinson's five and now three in the Arc,\" said the jockey.\n\nJUST WATCHED Ryan Moore wins Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe Replay More Videos ...

How could you say anything is higher than this? It's such a hard race to win.\"\n\nWhile the one-two-three -- his other mount in the race Highland Reel taking second -- was massively down to the trainer, it was also a nod to Galileo, the previous Derby winner who had sired all three Ballydoyle runners.\n\nIt was a facet not lost on O'Brien, who repeatedly uttered the mantra \"all three by Galileo\" while shaking his head in disbelief in the paddock afterward.\n\nPostponed, trained by Britain's Roger Varian, had gone into the race as the favorite but struggled coming up the rising home straight to finish a disappointing fifth place.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan's 47-year-old love affair with the race remains unrequited, this year's Japanese entry Makahiki failing to match the pace of Found or the rest of the leading entries.\n\nMoore, though, insisted his ride was far from perfect, pointing out that Found, \"went earlier than I might have liked but I thought 'I might as well take the chance now'.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED The Arc: the world's richest turf race Replay More Videos ...

Things worked out today, and on her best she is very hard to beat.\"\n\nThat the victory should be on good ground at the picturesque Chantilly rather than its traditional home of Longchamp made little difference to the rider. He said simply: \"To win an Arc anywhere is very special, it's an honor.\"\n\nHer owners pocketed the top prize of $3.2 million in what is Europe's richest race -- the overall purse is $5.6m -- and one of her owners, Michael Tabor, was understandably delighted with the result, describing her as \"as good as it gets\".\n\nThe question now remains whether she returns to the Breeders' Cup in November to defend her title.\n\nTabor said: \"If she's Found as we know her I guess that will be the plan. With all the talking in the world, the horses tell you.\"\n\nAs for the clean sweep of the Arc places, he added: \"I don't think that'll ever happen again.\"",

Cliff Carney, who manages the evidence and property section for the department. \u201cAfter 64, we\u2019re seeing huge seizures the come in. We\u2019ll get sometimes 300 to 400 boxes of marijuana at one time on one seizure.\u201d\n\nRELATED STORIES: Marijuana Legalization Story Archive\n\nDenver police are confiscating so much marijuana that Carney told CBS4 they are running out of space to store it. There are two storage rooms at the department\u2019s headquarters downtown, but they are quickly filling up with processed pot, plants and other evidence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with what we have,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe have a pretty good turnover so we don\u2019t have to keep it forever, but we have to have a place to store it and process it to get rid of it.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to fix the problem, Denver police is asking the city for a little more than $125,000 to hire additional staff and purchase more shelving.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked for more staffing to facilitate the property in the lab and composting facility,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked for more storage devices to hold (the marijuana). We\u2019ve already got money in the budget to compost, which is saving us quite a bit of money.\u201d\n\nAccording to Carney, DPD is among the first departments to compost illegal marijuana plants, after the court approves the disposal.\n\nConfiscated plants don\u2019t have a long shelf life and tend to start molding within a week or two, Carney explained. Marijuana that is processed and packaged can be kept for a longer period of time or returned to the person it was taken from, depending on what the courts determine to do with it.\n\nAs for why authorities are seizing more marijuana now than before it was legal, Carney said he can only speculate.\n\n\u201cBecause it is now legal in certain quantities, people nowadays believe they can exceed those quantities and there\u2019d be no prosecution, that it\u2019s not criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to see 15 to 20 plants at a time being seized at a small grow, now we\u2019ll see it in the hundreds, even thousands at warehouses.\u201d\n\nKelly Werthmann joined the CBS4 team in 2012 as the morning reporter, covering national stories like the Aurora Theater Shooting and devastating Colorado wildfires.

But the mega theme park hasn't been a blockbuster hit with China's cost-conscious consumers.\n\n\"It seems like the level of interest the Chinese have in the park has been waning a little bit,\" said Richard Huang, China entertainment industry analyst for Nomura.\n\nChinese media have carried several reports of complaints about long waits for popular rides and expensive food and drinks.\n\nShanghai Disney, which was 17 years in the making, has averaged around 20,000 visitors a day since its grand opening, Huang estimates. That adds up to about 7.3 million a year, less than half the 15 million Nomura and other experts had forecast.\n\nIt would also leave Shanghai lagging way behind similar Disney parks in California and Tokyo, which drew in 18.3 million and 16.6 million visitors respectively last year, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.\n\nDisney said in a statement that such speculation about attendance at the Shanghai park is \"meritless.\"\n\n\"Our financial results during the first 100+ days of operation have exceeded our expectations, and guest feedback has been extremely strong, establishing a solid foundation upon which to grow,\" said Bob Chapek, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.\n\nEarly days\n\nDisney has declined to give any specific numbers on how Shanghai's visitors are stacking up compared with its forecasts. CEO Bob Iger said in August that well over a million people had passed through its gates since the opening. And he was upbeat when speaking to investors in late September.\n\n\"It delivered more in the first 100 days than most parks that we've opened,\" he said.\n\nRelated: Disney CEO says China is tough but a 'great opportunity'\n\nAnalysts say huge theme parks can take a while to ramp up, and China offers particular challenges.\n\n\"It's only been open for about a quarter. China is a complicated market -- I didn't think Disney would get it right straight away,\" Huang said.\n\nSome of the complaints from customers have focused on the lines for top attractions such as the Tron ride.\n\nThree rides in seven hours\n\n\"The queues were almost unbearable for me, I had to wait for every single ride,\" Shao Mingsheng, a 45-year old who traveled from Beijing to visit the park last week, told CNNMoney. \"It's been over seven hours and I only got to get on three of them, even with an express pass.\"\n\nOther visitors CNNMoney spoke to last week said the lines weren't as bad as they had feared. Chinese media have reported waits of more than two hours for popular rides at the park.\n\n\"That's not something a lot of Chinese people are mentally prepared for,\" Nomura's Huang said, adding that he expected Chinese tourists, like their counterparts elsewhere, to get more used to extended waits for the big attractions.\n\nRelated: Just how big is Disney's new Shanghai resort?\n\nAnd impatience over access to rides isn't prompting people to leave the park.\n\n\"They're staying a lot longer per visit than we ever expected ... by almost two hours,\" Iger said.\n\nLonger visits in theory mean more time for customers to spend money on drinks, snacks and Disney merchandise. But not everyone is happy about the prices.\n\n\"The food is too expensive,\" said Shi Guanglin, 53, after visiting the park with family members. Chinese media have complained about pricey pork buns. Shanghai Disney says basic adult meals cost less than 100 yuan ($15).\n\nGuest satisfaction surveys show \"people love this park,\" Iger said last month.\n\nDisney can afford to charge more than other theme parks in China because of the superior quality of its attractions and the dazzling array of characters and movies it can draw on, according to Huang.\n\n'We want to smash them'\n\nBut that hasn't stopped one big rival with deep pockets from taking a dig at Mickey Mouse and friends.\n\nChina's richest man, Wang Jianlin, has repeatedly bashed Shanghai Disney this year, suggesting that the U.S. company's stars are past their prime (despite some of them apparently popping up at one of his own entertainment complexes).\n\n\"We want to smash them,\" Wang told CNNMoney last week. \"We are launching multiple projects at the same time to encircle Disney.\"\n\nBut Huang said the parks being developed by Wang's Dalian Wanda Group were aimed at residents of smaller, less affluent cities who wouldn't be interested in going to Disney anyway.\n\nRelated: This Chinese tycoon wants to conquer the entertainment world\n\n\"It's not the same kind of experience,\" he said. \"It would be like comparing Six Flags with Disney.\" Six Flags, once owned by CNN parent Time Warner (TWX), operates 18 regional theme and water parks across North America.\n\nShanghai Disney tickets cost 499 yuan ($75) on peak days and 370 yuan ($55) the rest of the time. That's cheaper than other Disney parks around the world, but roughly double the price of a Wanda park that opened about 350 miles southwest of Shanghai in May.\n\nUnlike the U.S. and Japan, China doesn't have any mega theme parks that draw more than 10 million visitors a year. The country's biggest is Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in the southern province of Guangdong, which brought in 7.5 million people last year.\n\nAnd China's economic growth and expanding middle class mean there's likely to be room for plenty more parks, such as Comcast (CCV)'s Universal Studios that's planned for Beijing.\n\n-- Ye Ling, Serenitie Wang and Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Shanghai (CNN) With a flash of a smile Wang Bin will charm you. With a furrowed brow he'll have you fearing for your life.\n\nAt 6-feet 3-inches tall, with 220 pounds of lean muscle, 22-year old Wang is a giant among his Chinese countrymen.\n\nHis handsome, expressive face and impressively imposing physique is why World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wants to make him one of its \"superstars.\"\n\nWang is the first Chinese pro-wrestler to sign a developmental contract with WWE.\n\nHe's spent the past three months training at its \"Performance Center\" in Orlando, Florida and was back in China last week to have his first match at a WWE live show in Shanghai.\n\n\"I'm having my debut WWE match in my motherland. I'm so excited and very happy,\" Wang, a native of Anhui province, told CNN a day before his big match.\n\n\"My family and friends will come to the arena and watch me compete.\"\n\nWang had his first show at the weekend.\n\nChina strategy\n\nWWE's shows are a lively mix of athleticism, drama and comedy.\n\nWrestlers with over-the-top personalities punch, kick and throw each other around a 20 x 20-foot ring to settle scripted storyline feuds, or compete for a coveted championship belt -- all before thousands of screaming fans who cheer for their heroes and heckle their villains.\n\nThe company has millions of fans around the world, but a combination of regulatory restrictions and an obvious language barrier have been challenges to growth in China, where it has a fiercely loyal but comparatively small following.\n\nOver the past six months, WWE has made some big moves to expand in the world's biggest marketplace -- home to a massive and increasingly wealthy middle class.\n\nIn April it hired Jay Li, its first vice president and general manager for China. In June it signed Wang as a performer and announced a deal with Chinese streaming service PPTV to carry its two premier weekly programs, \"Raw\" and \"Smackdown,\" live with Mandarin commentary and Chinese subtitles.\n\n\"Our strategy is fairly consistent,\" said George Barrios, WWE's chief financial and strategy officer. \"We come into the market. We're really consistent to building the brand. We bring the video in. We localize it in the language.\"\n\nChinese fans of WWE are growing in numbers.\n\nStars in training\n\nLast week, WWE announced it had signed seven more Chinese nationals to developmental contracts. They'll be joining Wang in Orlando and begin training next year.\n\n\"I think its super important,\" Li said. \"Signing a Chinese superstar generates additional interest for the casual fans who've just heard about us. Now they all of a sudden have a reason to log on and check it out.\"\n\nLi said he's found the best way to explain WWE's product to Chinese people is by comparing it to Kung Fu novels. \"And they get it immediately,\" he said. \"It's scripted entertainment that's full of action.\"\n\nJohn Cena, arguably WWE's most popular active performer, is known and loved by many Chinese fans for being able to say his catchphrase \"You can't see me\" in Mandarin. Although he admits, he doesn't say it correctly.\n\nAfter his first visit to China in 2010, he started studying Chinese to connect with his fans.\n\n\"Shanghai is a beautiful city and it's the most massive city that I've ever visited,\" Cena said.\n\n\"I figured if I could learn to speak the language, even in its most basic form, I could communicate with the culture better and be able to describe what we can do.\"\n\nThere's no guarantee that Wang Bin and the seven other Chinese signed to WWE will actually become fully-fledged superstars like Cena, and perform on its weekly televised shows and monthly pay per view events.\n\nNot only will they have to learn and perfect wrestling moves like bodyslams and suplexes, but they'll need to develop characters that connect with a global audience -- a process that could take years.\n\n\"We believe that to be a WWE superstar, you have to be able to transcend your own culture. You have to speak to everyone,\" George Barrios explained.\n\nJohn Cena learns Chinese to appeal to his Chinese fans\n\nUphill battle\n\nFor Wang, who speaks minimal English, communication has been an uphill battle. \"My trainers and I cannot directly communicate in words. We express ourselves in body language,\" he told CNN.\n\nIn addition to the hours of physical training, Wang also has to study English as part of his daily routine.\n\nOn Saturday night, he got his first chance to show fans what he's learned.\n\nDebuting his new ring name -- Tian Bin -- he pinned established WWE wrestler Bo Dallas after a powerful running slam -- and celebrated along with several thousand excited Chinese fans.\n\nWang knows as WWE's first Chinese performer he's got a lot to live up to.\n\n\"I definitely feel the pressure. We have so many fans in China,\" Wang said.\n\n\"But gradually, through my training, my opportunities, and my progress that comes from that, I'll take this pressure and turn it into power.\"",

    "text": "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) Frank Losonsky was just another 20-year-old soldier from Detroit, Michigan, but his life took a historic turn when a recruiter offered him the adventure of a lifetime.\n\nWould Losonsky be willing to board a ship headed to Asia and join a group of volunteers helping China fight off Japanese invaders?\n\nLosonsky said yes.\n\nThat was May of 1941. Now, 75 years later at age 96, Losonsky is one of three known living survivors of what's arguably the most famous fighter plane outfit in history: the Flying Tigers.\n\nIf you haven't heard the name Flying Tigers, you might recognize their planes. They flew US-made Curtiss P-40 Warhawks painted with a menacing looking shark-mouth design that eventually became iconic.\n\nDuring the outfit's short lifetime in 1941 and '42, 311 people were recruited for what was officially called the 1st American Volunteer Group.\n\nplanes, they racked up an amazing combat record in just about seven months, destroying 297 enemy aircraft in Burma, Thailand and China, according to Tripp Alyn of the Starting with 99planes, they racked up an amazing combat record in just about seven months, destroying 297 enemy aircraft in Burma, Thailand and China, according to Tripp Alyn of the AVG Flying Tiger Association . Twenty pilots qualified as \"aces\" by shooting down five enemy aircraft each.\n\nExperts say the Flying Tigers helped the US strategically by keeping Japan focused on China, giving the US economy time to gear itself up for the war by making tanks, planes and other weapons.\n\nFlying Tiger crew chief Frank Losonsky sits on the wing of a P-40 Warhawk fighter plane in 1942.\n\nSome Flying Tigers fought as pilots. Others -- including mechanics, clerks, doctors, dentists and nurses -- served as ground support. Losonsky was a crew chief in the 3rd Squadron -- maintaining three, sometimes four, airplanes. He also helped deliver bombs and salvage parts to keep the planes in the air.\n\nThe \"Hell's Angels\" 3rd Squadron was one of three Flying Tiger squadrons that fought the Japanese.\n\nThis weekend at Atlanta's DeKalb-Peachtree Airport, Losonsky climbed into a P-40 for the first time since the war, as part of a historic Flying Tiger reunion sponsored by the Commemorative Air Force, which works to preserve historic warbirds.\n\nLosonsky, 96, flew Thursday in the back of a plane like those he worked on years ago.\n\nof the. During his flight, Losonsky remained cool and calm in the back of the two-seat trainer.

If Japanese forces had captured them in Asia as civilians, they could be executed as spies.\n\nA Chinese soldier guards P-40 AVG Flying Tigers at an airfield somewhere in China.\n\nWith fascist Germany and Italy taking over Europe, many Americans in early 1941 wanted to stay out of the fighting.\n\nNot Losonsky.\n\n\"I felt like I was doing something,\" he said. \"I wasn't scared. I just thought that I could help a little.\"\n\nShipping out to join the 'gangsters'\n\nFrom its beginning, the Flying Tigers was a secret operation green-lighted by President Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nWhen recruits crossed the Pacific on commercial ships, they were forced to assume fake identities.\n\nLosonsky traveled under cover with a specially-made passport that said he was a missionary. Others made the trip posing as plantation managers, cowboys or even circus performers.\n\n2 of the last living WW2 AVG #FlyingTigers Frank Losonsky (left) & Chuck Baisden reunite with a P-40E Warhawk for #AWW16 #avgeek #milav pic.twitter.com/IMnMsRzVsp \u2014 Thom Patterson (@thompatterson) September 22, 2016\n\nThe plane used by the Tigers -- the P-40 Warhawk -- was \"built like a truck,\" Alyn said. Rugged construction allowed the P-40s to withstand steep dives as they swooped down on Japanese fighter planes from high above.\n\n\"The Japanese referred to them as 'gangsters' because they said they didn't fight fair,\" Alyn explained.\n\nA deadly attack\n\nAfter seven decades, memories tend to fade, but the horror of a Japanese air attack on a Flying Tiger base in Magwe, Burma, in March 1942, still haunts Losonsky.\n\nThe fighter planes \"shot up the airfield and all the equipment,\" he said, forcing him and his fellow Flying Tigers to take cover. \"I remember having to get into the slit trenches,\" he said. \"You could hear the Japanese shooting as they came in pretty high.\"\n\nLosonsky's friend, crew chief John Fauth of Red Lion, Pennsylvania, lost his life in that attack. \"That was real sad when that happened,\" Losonsky recalled. \"You had to be careful.\" Fauth was good man, he said. \"He was good to everybody.\"\n\nThree years ago, the graves of hundreds of Chinese troops who died fighting alongside the Flying Tigers reportedly were discovered in southern China. \"... despite official pledges to restore and protect it, little has been done,\" the New York Times reported in 2013\n\nThe adventure ends\n\nFlying Tiger pilots and ground crew were killed or went missing, By July 1942, the American Volunteer Group was disbanded and the mission was taken over by US Army aviators. Overall, 23Flying Tiger pilots and ground crew were killed or went missing, according to AVG Flying Tiger Association records\n\nSome surviving members had to find their own way home, said Losonsky's son, Terry Losonsky.\n\n\"But they all treated it like an adventure,\" he said. \"My dad and his very good friend ended up in South Africa and became good friends with the US consulate there.\"\n\n\"They were anxious to get back to the States, but they couldn't find a way.\"\n\nAmerican officials advised them to make themselves \"undesirable,\" Terry said. They went to \"one of the more posh hotels,\" where Frank Losonsky and his friend then \"sort of broke up some of the furniture.\"\n\nThat got them declared as \"undesirable\" by local government officials -- and earned them a ticket on an ocean freighter bound for the States soon after.\n\nGoing from merely famous to legendary\n\nAfter the war, Losonsky hired on as a commercial airline pilot for Trans Asiatic Airlines. While Losonsky hauled passengers between Manila, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Burma, the Flying Tigers' storied reputation continued to grow.\n\nYounger generations came to idolize the Tigers after toymakers Monogram and Revell began selling plastic Flying Tiger model kits . In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, shark-mouth P-40s hung from countless ceilings in kids' bedrooms across America.\n\nA-10 Thunderbolts at Georgia's Moody Air Force Base sport nose art similar to the Flying Tigers.\n\nOver the decades, other aircraft units in the US Army, Navy and the Air Force have adopted similar shark-mouth nose art. The 23rd Fighter Group based at Georgia's Moody Air Force Base painted its A-10 Thunderbolt attack jets with the motif.\n\nMost recently, the US Air Force Academy football team unveiled \"alternate\" helmets this season featuring the shark-mouth design , honoring the Tigers.\n\nGet your AirPower 1,000 Legacy Helmet TODAY! https://t.co/LNFiBCo9qB pic.twitter.com/FSOZctqKW9 \u2014 Falcon Pride Club (@AF_PrideClub) September 19, 2016\n\nFlying Tigers leader Claire Lee Chennault revealed the origin of the design in his 1949 memoir, \"Way of a Fighter.\"\n\n\"Our pilots copied the shark-tooth design on their P-40s' noses from a colored illustration in the India Illustrated Weekly depicting a [British Royal Air Force] squadron in the Libyan Desert with shark-nose P-40s,\" Chennault wrote. \"Even before that the German Air Force painted shark's teeth on some of its Messerschmitt 210 fighters.\"\n\nBut the Flying Tigers will be remembered for much more than their shark-mouth airplanes. Their legacy was forged by the hundreds of daring volunteers who chose to travel halfway around the world to risk their lives in a secret operation.\n\nOnly three of those volunteers are known to be alive today, including Losonsky, armorer Charles Baisden, age 96, and the last living Flying Tiger pilot, 99-year-old Carl Brown.\n\nBetween them, they're carrying the legacy of one of the most fascinating stories of World War II.",

    "text": "Houston County, Georgia (CNN) When vintage World War II bombers known as B-25 Mitchells thrill fans on the US airshow circuit, they honor the legacy of one of the most daring military missions in American history.\n\nAt Georgia's Perry-Houston County Airport on Friday a B-25 named Show Me sat at the end of Runway 36. Its powerful propeller twin engines shook the seats as the bomber waited to takeoff -- a little bit like Jimmy Doolittle and his raiders did in 1942 aboard the USS Hornet.\n\nEighty men volunteered for that mission -- what turned out to be a one-way air attack -- vengeance for Japan's strike on Hawaii that crippled the US Navy fleet and left 2,403 dead\n\nFor them, Pearl Harbor was their 9/11.\n\nAfter four months, it was time for payback.\n\nThe mission -- depicted in the 2001 film \"Pearl Harbor\" -- called for 16 US B-25s to take off from an aircraft carrier near Japan. The planes would bomb five Japanese cities and fly on to China, where the men would connect with friendly forces who would help them get home.\n\nJUST WATCHED Climb aboard a B-25 Mitchell Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Climb aboard a B-25 Mitchell 01:25\n\nOn April 18, 1942, Doolittle and co-pilot Richard E. \"Dick\" Cole sat in the cockpit of their B-25 going over a preflight check list with the engines running.\n\n\"I was setting the engine cowl flaps and watching to make sure the engines didn't overheat,\" said Cole, now 101 years old and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel.\n\n\"It was a bit hectic,\" he said, because crews were scrambling. The mission launch was moved up by 12 hours because of fears that Tokyo had been tipped off.\n\nAs a result, the B-25s would have to take off hundreds of miles farther from Japan than planned. That meant the planes wouldn't have enough fuel to guarantee they'd land safely in China.\n\n\"We were the first plane,\" Cole said. \"I remember I was hoping that we had done everything that we needed to do to make the takeoff. \"\n\nA versatile airplane\n\nAboard our Friday B-25 flight in Georgia, Show Me's pilot, Craig O'Mara, kept his feet on the brakes while pushing the throttles forward \u2014 revving up the ridiculously loud engines.\n\n\"The noise is intense,\" said David Thompsen, another Show Me pilot, because engine exhaust pipes aim toward the cockpit and crew cabin.\n\nWith a green light from air traffic controllers, O'Mara released the brake and unleashed the aircraft.\n\nThe 72-year-old plane raced 2,000 to 2,500 feet down the runway, accelerating to about 120 mph before completely leaving the ground.\n\nOwned by the Commemorative Air Force, Show Me appears at airshows nationwide to promote the Disabled American Veterans , a nonprofit charity which helps give a voice to disabled US vets returning from war. This weekend, the plane is one of the stars of the Thunder Over Georgia airshow at nearby Robins Air Force Base.\n\nDuring its heyday, the B-25 was a respectable warplane -- distinguished by its twin-tail and versatility. \"It became the most heavily armed airplane in the world, was used for high- and low-level bombing, strafing, photoreconnaissance, submarine patrol, and even as a fighter,\" according to Boeing.\n\nOf nearly 10,000 B-25s built by North American Aviation, Show Me (which was not on the Doolittle Raid) is among fewer than 50 that can still fly.\n\nFrom our Georgia airport, it's about 300 miles to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where Doolittle's raiders trained in secret seven decades ago to learn cross-country navigation without radios or landmarks and how to execute short takeoffs from ships.\n\n\"The highest risk for pilots during takeoff from a carrier would have been an engine failure at a slow speed,\" Thompsen said. Engine failure would force pilots to abort takeoff. They risked losing control of the plane which could allow it to veer into key structures on the ship.\n\nThe mission begins\n\nA typical B-25 takeoff uses about 2,000 feet of runway, Thompsen said. But the Hornet's deck allowed the planes as little as 300 feet to get airborne \u2014 otherwise they'd drop off the edge and crash into the ocean.\n\nAmazingly, the mission pilots had been trained to be able to take off as slowly as 75 mph with as little as 250 feet of runway.\n\nHave pilots ever tried that with Show Me? \"No we haven't,\" Thompsen said. \"That's a high-risk maneuver and we don't do that. We try to treat her gently.\"\n\nWith the natural winds, combined with speed from the moving ship, the B-25s only needed to get up to about 23 mph to fly off the Hornet, Cole said. Japan was about 650 miles away.\n\nA flag on the deck green-lighted the takeoff. It was time.\n\nBoth Cole and Doolittle kept their hands on the engine throttles to make sure the levers didn't accidentally slip downward and -- in case of engine failure -- to quickly bring the plane to a stop.\n\nWith his engines revving hard, Doolittle released the brakes, sending the plane barreling toward the ship's edge.\n\nSeconds later, the first raiders were airborne.\n\n'A little bit scary'\n\nThey made one circle over the Hornet and then pointed the airplane toward Japan. Soon, all 15 remaining planes followed. The grueling mission had begun.\n\n\"I remember thinking we had just separated ourselves from civilization,\" Cole said. \"The range of our short-wave radio was only about 45 miles and we were going to be more than 45 miles away from civilization for 8 or 10 hours.\"\n\n\"In a way it was a little bit scary,\" he said. But they were fully committed. There was no turning back.\n\nDoolittle's crew: From left: navigator Henry \"Hank\" Potter, pilot James \"Jimmy\" Doolittle, bombardier Fred Braemer, co-pilot Richard \"Dick\" Cole, engineer/gunner Paul Leonard\n\nTo avoid detection, the raiders flew extremely close to the Pacific \u2014 sometimes dangerously low.\n\nAt speeds around 190 mph, Doolittle flew about 200 feet above the water. Incredibly, some pilots flew as low as 50 feet. One stiff wind or mistake in the cockpit could've sent the 14-ton bombers crashing into the ocean.\n\n'Drop the bombs'\n\nAt about noon, Doolittle and Cole's crew were the first of the raiders to reach Tokyo. Still flying low, they encountered no air attacks, Cole said. Apparently, the element of surprise was intact.\n\nBombardier Fred Braemer found a target and \"Col. Doolittle pulled up to 1,500 feet and said, 'Drop the bombs,'\" Cole recalled. At one point over Tokyo Cole spotted several Japanese aircraft high above. \"Apparently they did not see us,\" he said.\n\nThe B-25's bomb bay is pretty much completely enclosed. \"The bomb bay doors are hydraulically operated and they move very fast,\" Thompsen said. \"When they close, they're kind of like a guillotine.\"\n\nOverall, the raiders' 16 planes hit factory areas, oil storage facilities and military installations.\n\nDespite plenty of anti-aircraft fire from the ground, all the planes reached their targets without being shot down.\n\nThe raiders had accomplished their mission. They disproved Japan's claims that the mainland was impervious to enemy attack.\n\nThey also had dealt America's first blow in response to Pearl Harbor -- raising morale back home.\n\n\"I felt that we made a pretty good retaliatory strike,\" Cole said.\n\nJumping out of a plane in the dark during a storm\n\nBut the mission was far from over. They still had to get home -- via China.\n\nWhen Doolittle and Cole's plane reached the Chinese coast they were running low on fuel.\n\nWorse, it was dark and they were surrounded by a powerful storm. With no safe landing zone in sight, Doolittle ordered his crew to bail out at 9,000 feet, traveling about 166 mph.\n\n\"All kinds of ideas go through your head\" before you jump out of an airplane into the dark during a thunderstorm,\" Cole said.\n\n\"Number one, you hoped that the 'chute would work and number two, you hoped you'd have a sense to know what you were going to hit in the terrain below you when you bailed out.\"\n\n\"Fortunately for me, I didn't have to worry about hitting the ground,\" he said. \"My 'chute opened fine and it caught on a small pine tree which made my landing very easy.\"\n\nCole spent the night in his parachute, suspended about 10 feet off the ground. The next day he met up with friendly Chinese Nationalist troops who also found Doolittle and the rest of the crew. A few days later they all were escorted to a US military aircraft, which flew them to safety\n\nThe legacy\n\nDoolittle Raider Robert Hite was captured and held for 40 months until his release in 1945. He died in 2015.\n\nOverall, 11 crews bailed out of their bombers. Four planes crash-landed. One crew flew to the Soviet Union. Of the 80 raiders, three were killed in action. Eight were captured; one starved to death in a Japanese prison camp and three were executed.\n\nAs if they hadn't done enough, after recovering from their mission, many raiders, including Cole, rejoined the war to fight again.\n\nAfter the war, the surviving raiders lived out the rest of their lives, pursuing careers, building families, enjoying their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nWhen the president calls & puts us into the fight, the #B21 #Raider will answer our nation's call! @SecAF23https://t.co/KHVmvxtrLh \u2014 U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) September 19, 2016\n\nLast June, former B-25 gunner/engineer David Thatcher died at age 94, making Cole the last living raider.\n\nWhen you can look back on a life like Cole's, you've likely learned a few lessons along the way. The man who helped lead the Doolittle raiders offered some advice.\n\n\"As you go through life,\" Cole said, \"expect the unexpected.\"",

    "text": "Driven by its staunch opposition to Donald Trump, The Atlantic has endorsed Hillary Clinton for President of the United States, marking just the third time in the magazine's 160-year history that it has made a presidential endorsement.\n\nLabeling the Republican presidential nominee \"a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar,\" The Atlantic's editors encouraged their readers to \"act in defense of American democracy and elect his opponent.\"\n\nThe last time The Atlantic took sides in a presidential election was in 1964, when it sided with Lyndon B. Johnson due to similar fears about his opponent, Barry Goldwater. Its only other presidential endorsement came 104 years earlier when it backed Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\"The Atlantic does not have a tradition of weighing in on presidential contests except when there is perceived to be a danger to the Republic,\" Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic's national correspondent and the man who wrote the first draft of the endorsement, told CNNMoney.\n\n\"The founding manifesto of The Atlantic was that it would be 'the organ of no party or clique,'\" Goldberg continued. \"We adhere to that. Only when a candidate is so obviously dangerous, or so obviously unqualified for the job, does The Atlantic decide to weigh in.\"\n\nThe Atlantic's endorsement comes less than a week after USA Today, the most widely circulated newspaper in the nation, published an editorial encouraging its readers not to vote for Trump because, it said, he lacks \"the temperament, knowledge, steadiness and honesty that America needs from its presidents.\"\n\nRelated: USA Today urges voters to oppose Trump\n\nWhile the impact of presidential endorsements by media outlets is subject to debate, both endorsements are notable coming from news organizations that have resisted partisan classification.\n\nUnlike USA Today, The Atlantic's endorsement does encourage readers to vote for Clinton. It acknowledges, though, that it is \"mainly concerned with the Republican Party's nominee, Donald J. Trump, who might be the most ostentatiously unqualified major-party candidate in the 227-year history of the American presidency.\"\n\nGoldberg said no single issue influenced The Atlantic's decision, but rather that it was the result of Trump's overall record, character and temperament.\n\n\"The evidence accumulated over time,\" he said. \"This is not a normal election and Trump is not a normal candidate.\"",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) So, it's Clinton and Gore, back on the campaign trail.\n\nIn 1992 and 1996 , of course, Al Gore was the running mate of President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe point, apparently, is to persuade millennials to vote for Hillary Clinton by appealing to their concern about climate change. That's a laudable goal. Clinton would basically continue President Obama's climate policies, which aren't enough to adequately address the perils of global warming, but should be seen as exceptional when compared to those of her opponent, Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly called climate science a hoax (it's not) and says he wants to boost the coal industry, despite the fact that pollution from that fuel is a disaster both for the climate and public health.\n\nWe millennials -- at 33, I'm at the top of the range -- are primed to hear these arguments. As a group, we care more about climate change than older voters. That only makes sense considering we (and all future generations) will inherit an era of rising seas and super droughts associated with our continued addiction to fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence called Tuesday night for the US to be willing to use the military to hit the Syrian regime and to establish safe zones to protect civilians.\n\nThe answer seemingly put him at odds with running mate Donald Trump, who has largely advocated a pullback from foreign conflicts and requiring US allies to take on more of their own defense. It also lines him up more closely with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and his debate opponent, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, both of whom have advocated a Syrian no-fly zone.\n\n\"The United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo,\" Pence said in reference to the besieged Syrian city.\n\n\"I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is to immediately establish safe zones,\" Pence said at the first and only vice presidential debate, at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, \"so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas (and) work with our Arab partners in real time to make that happen.\"\n\nIt wasn't the only time Pence departed from his running mate's script on foreign policy issues or denied some of Trump's foreign policy pronouncements.\n\nPence repeatedly criticized Clinton and Kaine for the drawdown of US troops in Iraq, blaming Clinton for failing to negotiate an agreement with Iraq that would have provided legal protections for US troops there. While the Obama administration was not successful in making such an arrangement, Pence didn't mention that the Obama White House inherited an agreement from President George W. Bush that required all US troops to leave Iraq by 2011 or that the Iraqi parliament had refused to grant US troops legal immunity if they stayed in the country.\n\nMoreover, in a 2006 interview with CNBC, Trump said he wanted to see Bush, then still president, \"get us out of Iraq, which is a total mess, a total catastrophe, and it's not going to get any better. It's only going to get worse.\"\n\nPence also denied that he or Trump had ever praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a better leader than President Barack Obama, though both have spoken positively of him and the Indiana governor told CNN's Dana Bash in September that he was a \"stronger leader\" than the current occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nIn Asia, Trump advocated letting US allies deal with the threat of a nuclear North Korea on their own, even suggesting that longtime US partners like South Korea and Japan obtain nuclear weapons themselves. Kaine pounced on this at one point, saying that \"Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Pence to Kaine: You would know about campaign insults Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pence to Kaine: You would know about campaign insults 01:15\n\nPence, for his part, outlined a position that didn't sound much like Trump's. The Indiana governor said that \"we need an effective US diplomacy to marshal the nations in the Asian rim to put pressure on North Korea,\" which is what the Obama administration and its predecessors have favored.\n\nThe White House, however, has opposed a no-fly zone in Syria. The safe zone would be an area inside the country that the US and allied planes would defend from Syrian or Russian attack. It raises thorny legal problems, because doing so without the host country's permission means violating international law. And the possibilities for military escalation are very high if a US, Russian or Syrian plane were shot down. At this point, many military experts say a no-fly zone isn't possible.\n\nTrump has said that he would be willing to support a safe zone, but only financially. When asked whether the US should be involved in establishing safe zones, Trump told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" in October 2015 that he would \"help them economically, even though we owe $19 trillion.\"\n\nIn that same interview, Trump said he would \"love a safe zone for people.\"\n\n\"What they should do is, the countries should all get together, including the Gulf states, who have nothing but money, they should all get together and they should take a big swath of land in Syria and they do a safe zone for people, where they could to live, and then ultimately go back to their country, go back to where they came from,\" Trump said.\n\nClinton called for a no-fly zone in Syria in October 2015, soon after Russia entered the country and started a bombing campaign to help President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nJUST WATCHED Tim Kaine attacks Trump's 'insult-driven' campaign Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tim Kaine attacks Trump's 'insult-driven' campaign 00:59\n\n\"I personally would be advocating now for a no-fly zone and humanitarian corridors to try to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air,\" Clinton said in an interview with Boston's WHDH.\n\nThe White House has said a Syrian safe zone is off the table because of the enormous military commitment it would take to effectively enforce it and the ongoing responsibility of protecting its borders. Several Pentagon officials have told Congress that the costs would outweigh the benefits because it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation between US forces and Russia or Syria in the skies.\n\nPresident Barack Obama laid out some of the complexities of a no-fly zone in remarks he made in Germany in April. \"It's not a matter of me not wishing I could help and protect a whole bunch of people,\" Obama said. \"It's a very practical issue about how do you do it? And who is going to put on a bunch of ground troops inside of Syria? And how do you let people in? And who do you let in and who do you let out? And how is it monitored?\"\n\nObama said that after multiple talks about a possible safe zone with the Defense Department, \"It is very difficult to see how it would operate, short of us essentially being willing to (use) militarily take over a big chunk of that country.\"\n\nKaine has said that while he initially supported the administration's argument against safe zones, by December 2015, he had changed his mind. That month he told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that \"the absence of the humanitarian zone will go down as one of the big mistakes that we've made.\"",

Back in 2014.\n\nRight now the world is watching the metastasizing humanitarian catastrophe known as the Syrian civil war unfold in real time. But this disaster should surprise no one: It is the natural result of a series of policy decisions that led to the current diplomatic standoff.\n\nStep by step, humanitarian access has been turned into a weapon . As an aid worker with the International Rescue Committee told me last month , \"the very nature of humanitarian access has almost been redefined in Syria.\"\n\nThe Syrian civil war has laid bare a great deal, including the world's unwillingness to intervene to stop civilians from being killed in their beds and on their streets in a conflict that has pinned them down in their homes. Every time those close to the war think things have sunk as barbarically low as imaginable -- from bombing convoys to starving towns -- things get even worse.\n\n\"Before, when Aleppo was being bombarded by the regime, people used to go to the basement to hide,\" says Kholoud Helmi, a founder of the Syrian underground newspaper Enab Baladi. \"Recently the regime is using missiles that can reach down into the basement.\"\n\nOne of Helmi's friends in Aleppo said that he used to tell his children they could not go into the streets to play with other kids because he feared he would have to shuttle them down to the basement to escape the bombardments at any moment.\n\n\"Since the missiles are being used to dig down and then kill in basements , he is letting his kids go play in the streets because he wants them to go have fun because they are going to die in a minute,\" Helmi says. \"At any minute a missile is going to hit them either in the street or in the basement.

Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Can Russia and US reach common ground on Syria? 01:53\n\nFor many of those in the United States who have worked on Syria policy for years, the overwhelming sense of frustration has made the bloodshed nearly impossible to watch, in part because of its predictability.\n\nThe ghost of the Iraq War looms large in Washington, but the question is what lessons has it offered? What is without question is that the conflict has prevented the Obama administration from committing sustained resources to stopping the carnage. Officials in Washington who for years argued for greater intervention could never prove the counterfactual: that further American action would make things on the ground in Syria better, not worse. And so the status quo prevailed. And that status quo was to do little to address the conflict's root causes, but a great deal to fund help for refugees who were suffering the war's effects.\n\nMeanwhile, the carnage has continued. And we have reached the moment the administration official and I spoke of two years ago: the siege of Aleppo, the place to which so many Syrians had fled seeking safety during the last years of conflict after being forced to flee other towns and cities throughout the country.\n\nJUST WATCHED Picking up the pieces in Aleppo Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Picking up the pieces in Aleppo 01:56\n\nThe United Nations once spoke of a responsibility to protect. In 2009 it said that in the face of war crimes , when a state was \"manifestly failing\" to protect its population,\" then the international community was prepared to take collective action in a \"timely and decisive manner.\"\n\nYet there is nothing either timely or decisive about the world's approach to Syria, which has become the theater in which global and regional actors pursue their own goals, with Syrian mothers and fathers trapped in cities under attack paying the price. But this piece is not about dueling political aims; it is about shared misery of those on the ground and an international community that has failed them.\n\nWhat is life in Aleppo like now? Bombing in plain sight. Hospitals crushed under the weight of the injured and the dying. Food and water supplies dwindling. Medical supplies limited to almost nothing, leaving anesthesia near nonexistent and babies dying without functioning ventilators on the dirty floors of the few overwhelmed facilities that remain standing.\n\nAnd all of it is happening in real time as the hell of the city's life and death is captured on social media and shared with the world.\n\nOnly the world seems to have stopped watching. And the international community is now shown to be impotent in the face of what the British ambassador to the United Nations termed \"war crimes.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Picking up the pieces in Aleppo Replay More Videos ...

The pictures may be on phones and screens within easy reach, but a solution to ending the bloodshed remains much further away.\n\n\"Most of us, we don't want to lose hope, but in the end if you look at the situation it is hopeless, and you can't do anything, so we are just watching,\" Helmi says from her home in southern Turkey, where she was forced to flee after friends and fellow citizen reporters were detained and killed. \"People are dying and the situation is getting worse and worse.\"\n\nWith no end in sight.

    "text": "(CNN) I remember the first time I consciously went to King's Cross, on the northeastern edge of central London, and by \"consciously,\" I mean in the first sweaty bloom of swaggering adolescence, up for life and mouth wide open to suck up the big city.\n\nMy friend John and I had traveled in by Tube from our natal homes in the north London 'burbs; we had \u00a39 in cash between us and we were wired on amphetamine \"blues\"-- speed pills that, at four for \u00a31, were attractively priced for teenaged punk rockers in the late 1970s. We were en route to Jock's Tattoo Parlour, and perhaps this fact alone -- that we had to journey across town to be inkily inscribed -- serves to separate that era from this one, when no gentrifying London neighborhood is complete without its own body-modification salon and most of the city's inhabitants resemble Maori warriors going into battle.\n\nJock's was a malodorous little nook on the scabrous section of the Pentonville Road that runs east from King's Cross station. I say \"runs,\" because whatever the evolutionary end point of the massive redevelopment currently under way in King's Cross, I doubt the thick miasma of debauchery and desuetude that hangs over this dingy dell will ever be dispelled.\n\nIn 1977 the road was dominated by the strange Victorian turret of the Lighthouse Building and the Scala Cinema's lone cupola -- both structures that remain in place today. John and I breasted the crowds of office workers, warily eyed skulking prostitutes and drug dealers, then dived into Jock's and stood there, quaking, in the gloomy cigarette-stunk interior.\n\nScuzz, light industry and neglect\n\nThe eponymous tattooist was a huge, bearded old biker who sat behind a wooden bench, upon which were arranged the electric tools of his trade. So far as I can recall, there wasn't a clean needle or disinfected surface in sight.\n\n\"Blimey,\" Jock spat, \"look what the f-ing cat dragged in. What's up with you two -- speeding, or what?\" We teeth-chatteringly admitted this was indeed the case and Jock, not unkindly, took us to task: \"I expect you little toerags are paying well over the odds, you should come down 'ere to get yer gear.\"\n\nAnd with a flourish he pulled a huge plastic bag full of amphetamines from behind his bench. We quailed, suitably chastened, then bared our scrawny arms to receive \u00a39-worth of his indelible artistry. Mine, the head of a black puma, has since been tattooed over.\n\nJust shy of four decades later I decided to cycle across town from Lambeth, the south London neighborhood where I now live, up across the river and northeast to King's Cross.\n\nA friend of mine, the artist Antony Gormley, was throwing his 65th-birthday party in his studio on Vale Royal where for the past 13 years he's constructed vast and steely artworks based on the form of his own body.\n\nWhen Gormley first moved here, the area was still a characterful cocktail: one part scuzz to one part light industry, and two of outright neglect.\n\n\"There is no comparison\" to the neighborhood today, he told me over tea in his airy -- yet severely functional -- atelier, which was designed by David Chipperfield. \"Parts of King's Cross used to be like a bit of the industrial West Midlands transposed to London -- there were those fantastic charcoal-patinated walls, with big granite copingstones.\"\n\nLeft: St. Pancras International, which now houses the Renaissance Hotel. Right: Students from Central St. Martins, near the art school's new Granary Square campus.\n\nGormley's studio is about half a mile north of King's Cross station. As in most great Victorian cities, London's main rail stations were built in the late 19th century in a ring around what was then the city's periphery: property rights in the center were too entrenched (and their owners too powerful) for the iron road to ride roughshod over them.\n\nIn the immediate purlieu of Waterloo, sort of shady activities associated with mass transit proliferated during the latter part of the 19th century: the liquor and sex trades, gambling establishments, hotels-cum-brothels, pawnbrokers and shebeens.\n\nBut in this part of town there were no fewer than three mainline railway stations -- Euston itself, St. Pancras, and King's Cross -- so the shades clustered commensurately, becoming thicker and darker than in any other part of the capital.\n\nGormley and his wife, the painter Vicken Parsons, have mixed memories of the seedy seepage up the Euston Road: \"There was a period when they flushed all the drug dealers out from around the station,\" he told me, \"and all the prostitutes and dealers came up this way. We came home one evening and a prostitute was entertaining her client on our front steps.\"\n\nNeo-Gothic extravagance\n\nKing's Cross has a bogus reputation as the site where Queen Boudicca fought with London's Roman occupiers -- a fiction enshrined in the local street name Battle Bridge Road.\n\nIt actually takes its name from an odd, octagonal brick tower surmounted by a statue of King George IV that was erected at the intersection of Gray's Inn Road and Pentonville Road in the 1830s and pulled down a decade or so later.\n\nThe station itself was built in the early 1850s, and is a huge structure with a sweeping brick facade that, until the recent renovations, was obscured by a jumble of later accretions.\n\nSt. Pancras International, right beside King's Cross, serves the Midlands region and, for the past few years, has been the terminal for Eurostar service to the continent.\n\nSt. Pancras is perhaps the most extravagant example of neo-Gothic architecture in a city with more than its fair share: during my childhood, its finials and spires and flying buttresses were coated with a thick, black slather of smog left over from industrial-era London's countless coal fires.\n\nNow it has been thoroughly cleaned up, and as well as the trains, the building today houses the suitably named Renaissance Hotel. (A new Standard Hotel -- the first outside the US -- is currently being built across the street in the old Camden Town Hall building.\n\nThe King's Cross rehabilitation project officially began here, radiating out to the north, filling in the disused shunting yards and engine sheds that lay alongside the train tracks with shiny, happy new buildings.\n\nLeft: King's Cross Pond Club, a naturally filtered swimming pool with views of St. Pancras International and the BT tower. Right: The newly refurbished departures concourse at King's Cross station.\n\nIn fact, the regeneration process began much earlier than we might suppose. The British Library moved to the site abutting St. Pancras station in the late 1990s. I remember visiting with its then director, who took me down into the just-completed underground stacks: eight subterranean, temperature-controlled floors, housing a portion of the library's 150 million books.\n\nColin St. John Wilson's design was an effective compromise between soft Modernism and angular Gothicism that synced the library with its surrounding environment. It's this harmony that the newer, far more extensive construction to the north needs to sustain if King's Cross's character is to be modulated rather than nullified.\n\nThe signs so far are good. Apart from the cartoonish Paul Day statue of lovers embracing that stands on the platform area, St. Pancras station is now light and modern -- pleasing as well as functional. King's Cross, next door, is something of a tour de force, with a huge new vaulted waiting area and a piazza out front where, with a certain inevitability, nice liberals are now selling artisanal produce.\n\nThe walkway running from the station northeast to the new King's Place building on York Way is, however, less successful: walking here by day, I'm always struck by how the little pop-up installations -- a viewing platform, an espresso stall, food huts -- seem to loom larger than the new buildings.\n\nEnormous and surly gravity\n\nThis is partly because of what the philosopher Walter Benjamin termed \"vertical type\": in this case, slogans blazoned all over these temporary structures, exhorting us to buy and walk and observe and \"inherit\"-- in short, instructing us on how to be flaneurs, as if we haven't been doing this stuff all our lives.\n\nThe boxy installations evoke the innumerable railway carriages that clattered northward from the three great stations -- as well as the equally myriad narrow boats that oozed through the stygian waters of the Regent's Canal.\n\nThis evocation somehow counts against the brightly futuristic promise of the new building developments, and draws us back again to the area's dark past. King's Cross has this peculiar air, still, of enormous and surly gravity -- the filth and effluent from the old gasworks that once operated here compacted to atomic densities -- and an opposing levity: everyone is hurrying, everyone is going somewhere at speed.\n\nThe Guardian Media Group has its new offices in King's Place, which also contains an arts venue and exhibition areas, plus the ubiquitous foodie overkill without which no new public building can pat its glassy, parametrically designed stomach and announce itself to be complete.\n\nThis publishing company can be seen as the liberal counterweight to the 1 million square feet of office space Google is acquiring in King's Cross Central (as the redeveloped locale is being styled by its developers).\n\nAs a contributor, I occasionally go into the Guardian's offices, and I've also taken part in live events at King's Place, after which I've eaten in its restaurant, looking out at the great scum of oil and pigeon feathers that swirls over the waters of the canal basin -- a nice contrast to the acres of blond wood and plate glass within.\n\nThere are shiny new restaurants everywhere, many of them -- Caravan, Dishoom, the Grain Store -- in striking old industrial spaces. Later this year Jamie Oliver is opening a canal-side complex in Goods Yard that will house his company headquarters along with a vast restaurant.\n\nLisa Allardice, editor of the Guardian's Review section, told me that when she moved here with the rest of the paper's staff from the old Gray's Inn Road offices, \"The most exciting thing to do was a trip to the pharmacy at lunchtime.\" Now, Allardice is a King's Cross booster: \"We can't move for all the incredible buildings and bright young hipsters out on a Thursday evening.\"\n\nLeft: Indian street snacks at Dishoom King's Cross; Right: Sculptor Antony Gormley's studio.\n\nAntony Gormley was more forthcoming about the downside of the rise of King's Cross.\n\nWhile acknowledging the vibrancy and eclecticism of the crowds swirling around the new piazzas and along the new pedestrian walkways, he says: \"The tragedy may be that in the financing of the area the land values have been inflated. Now the annual per-square-foot rental price is \u00a380, whereas in the City of London it's \u00a370. The justification is the lie that if you come to King's Cross you're going to be part of the trendy avant-garde.\"\n\nOne of the iconic British movies of the 1980s was written and directed by Mike Leigh, a filmmaker who continues to summon up London's genius loci in his socially acute dramas.\n\nIn \"High Hopes,\" (1988) Cyril, a Marxist motorcycle courier, and Shirley, his girlfriend, live in an apartment block right next to King's Cross station. I remember this building well: one of a pair that then stood on Battle Bridge Road, originally part of a group of five.\n\nThe Stanley Buildings were constructed in the 1860s for railway employees, and were notable for their elegant ironwork balconies and exterior stairways. By the time I jittered down to Jock's, the last two had become squats, mostly occupied by my fellow punks.\n\nGentrification\n\nLeigh's movie charts the rise of the yuppies under Margaret Thatcher's government and their gentrification of London's run-down inner-city areas. The climactic scene has Cyril standing on the roof of one of the Stanley Buildings and inveighing against these changes, while in the middle distance the skeletal silhouette of a gasholder looms.\n\nToday, that gasholder is all that remains; the last Stanley Building has been refurbished and pressed into service as a retro-style office block. If Cyril were up there now and could see what's happened, he'd probably fall off the roof in surprise. I nearly fell off my bike the other night when the floodlit jets of water laid out in a gridlike formation in front of the new Central St. Martins building burst into life.\n\nPedaling in between their surreal splashes, I marveled at the sheer vastness of the old granary buildings that have now been converted into a campus for London's University of the Arts -- and marveled still more at the plastic stacking chairs upturned on the studio workbenches inside. When it comes to life-drawing classes, it seems it's a case of plus \u00e7a change.\n\nLeft: Evening drinks on the roof of a canalboat and new waterside seating off Granary Square; Right: The mirrored panels of Gasholder No. 8, a disused Victorian gas tank now converted into a public art piece.\n\nKing's Cross Central is taking form around a series of 10 public spaces, including three new squares. The fine views of St. Paul's Cathedral and central London from the north side of the site are to be protected, and while some buildings will be as high as 27 stories, there's also a lot of low-to-medium-rise.\n\nThe area is bounded to the east by York Way, a grim runnel of an arterial route; to the west by the train line out of St. Pancras; and to the northwest by the curving line of the high-speedrail connection to the Continent.\n\nYet the most important transport the developers have at their disposal is none of these. Rather, it's the canal towpath linking the new \"place\" (which is how contemporary developers bizarrely style their creations, as if all that came before was void and without form) with Camden Lock, a mile or so to the east.\n\nLong the epicenter of face-metaland-henna-tattooing-by-appointment for European teenagers, this complex of street markets and eateries will, I predict, eventually merge with King's Cross Central, so that visitors will be able to complete a great east-west passeggiata, with retail and snacking opportunities every inch of the way.\n\nControversies\n\nI may sound a little cynical, but trust me, I'm not. The debate about London's built environment is focused at the moment on the grotesque sight of capital fleeing from unstable regions of the world to take spatial form on the city's skyline.\n\nRow upon row of bar-code-fa\u00e7ade \"luxury flats\" are being built, while the provision of affordable housing in the city -- even for key workers -- keeps declining.\n\nThe optimistic developers' view is that no matter how shiny and new the starchitects' infill of the roughly triangular 67-acre King's Cross Central site, the grimy and the old will continue to inform it.\n\nYet compared with the big new London developments that are exercises in \"placemaking\" entirely de novo, I think King's Cross Central does have a real chance of knitting with the ancient fabric of the city, so that soon enough it will seem lived-in -- and may even come to possess that most evanescent of urban phenomena, \"character.\"\n\nOf course, this will only be a passing phase -- before long, like in a plot of a Stephen King horror novel, that \"character\" will begin to grow stronger and mutate, cloning itself into an entire cast of separate characters. And as King's Cross Central continues to feed off the raw economics and attendant atmospherics of its three rail stations, so all the activities its well-tended and monied new spaces are designed to prohibit will slowly, insidiously, begin to reassert themselves.\n\nNo, I'm not cynical about King's Cross Central, because I know you can't keep the essential scuzziness of King's Cross down for long. It may take 10 or even 20 years, but eventually the jittery teenagers will return from the 'burbs, and they'll find Jock's lineal descendant waiting for them, a crooked grin bisecting his raddled old face.\n\nThe Details: What to Do in King's Cross, London\n\nHotels\n\nSt. Pancras Renaissance Hotel After more than 30 years of neglect, the old After more than 30 years of neglect, the old Midland Grand Hotel has returned to its former glory as the Renaissance, sparking a revitalization of the surrounding neighborhood.

    "text": "Credit card issuers are in such fierce competition these days to attract new customers that most have started offering outrageous deals to win you over, like huge introductory bonuses worth hundreds of dollars, and miles programs that pay more than ever before. For example, who can say no to earning 40k miles just taking a new credit card on a test drive?*\n\nBut with so many cards offering so many different potential rewards and bonuses, which cards have the best features, and which is best for your particular spend and travel habits? In order to help answer those questions, we researched all the miles rewards cards we could find, then put together the pros and cons of the best of the best below. Happy travels!!\n\nThe Top Miles Card For Those Who Spend More Than $1,500 Per Month\n\nCapital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Industry-Leading 2 Mile Per Dollar Reward Rate. 40K Mile New-Account Bonus (essentially a free trip off the bat)\n\nPros: Best-in-class miles rewards rate of 2 miles per dollar of spend. Huge introductory ($400 value) bonus offer for activating and using the card to make at least $3,000 in purchases in the first 3 months. That's basically a free trip just for signing up and using the card for 3 months. No blackout dates, total flexibility on where you can use your miles: any airline, any hotel, any time. Rewards are redeemable for cash value. No foreign transaction fees when you use your card abroad.\n\nCons: The $59 annual fee (waived for first year), although this is effectively the cost of entry to a card paying such high rewards. Requires good credit.\n\nThe Verdict: We recommend this card to anyone who will spend more than $1,500/month, as that is when it really becomes worth it to pay the fee in exchange for the higher miles per dollar earned by the card. Because there is no annual fee in the first year, it's a great move to test the card out, earn the 40k mile bonus while in the no-fee first year, and then have the full year to decide if you spend enough per month to justify keeping the card for a second year. Bottom line, for those who spend more than $1,500 a month, the large bonus and high ongoing miles reward rate makes the Venture Rewards a tough card to beat, and our highest-rated card in the travel category.\n\nRecommended Credit: Good to Excellent\n\nMore Details >\n\nThe Top Miles Card For Those Who Might Spend Less Than $1,500 Per Month\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Miles Incredible 3 Miles Per Dollar Reward Rate During First Year\n\nPros: Discover it Miles is our top no-fee miles reward card for a simple reason: the card will add up all the miles you earn using the card during the first year, then double them. Because the base rate is already a very high 1.5 miles per dollar, that means if you get the Discover it Miles, you'll earn an insane 3 miles per dollar throughout the first year, with no limit. You get that high a miles per dollar reward rate, and you don't have to pay an annual fee, unlike many miles rewards cards which offer far lower rewards rates. In addition, the Discover it\u00ae Miles has a 0% intro APR* on purchases for 12 months. There is also the option of getting a direct deposit of cash to your bank account instead of accumulating mile rewards dollars.\n\nCons: You trade an up-front large intro bonus for no annual fee and an intro APR on purchases for 12 months.\n\nThe Verdict: If you plan on spending more than $1,500 per month on your card, the Discover it\u00ae Miles would be a good choice because of the matching miles offer at the end of the first year. If you maintain at least a 1,500 spend per month, that will net you at least 54,000 bonus miles (a $540 value) with end of the year with your matched miles reward. There are no blackout dates on any airline anytime, and there is an unlimited 1.5 mile per dollar travel reward which can be converted to cash if you prefer. The 0% intro APR for purchases for 12 months and no annual fee are also good perks.\n\nRecommended Credit:Good to Excellent\n\nMore Details >\n\nRunner-Up No Fee Miles Reward Card\n\nCapital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards No Annual Fee. 1.25X Miles Rewards Rate, 20,000 Miles Bonus For New Accounts\n\nPros: If you don't plan on spending more than $1,000 per month on your card, the VentureOne Rewards would come out on top because of the higher bonus offer for new accounts (for spending more than $1,000 total in the first 3 months). The $200 value of the bonus is quite nice, especially in the context of a no-fee card. We also like the idea of earning all those miles during the first year without paying anything in interest during the intro period.\n\nCons: The 1.25X miles rewards rate is lower than the Discover it Miles.\n\nThe Verdict: A great combination of no annual fee, 0% intro APR, solid miles rewards, and a nice fat 20k mile bonus.\n\nRecommended Credit: Good to Excellent\n\nMore Details >\n\nBankAmericard Travel Rewards\u00ae Credit Card No Annual Fee. 1.5 Points Per Dollar Reward Rate. 20k Point New-Account Bonus\n\nPros: We recommend this card to anyone who might spend less than $1,500 per month on their credit cards. It pays a very high point per dollar reward rate (1.5) while never charging an annual fee. This means you don't have to worry about an annual fee offsetting the rewards you worked hard to earn. Rewards are also very flexible, with no blackout dates, and there are no foreign transaction fees. The BankAmericard also features an especially appealing offer for existing Bank of America account holders: if you have an account at B of A, you will be eligible to earn up to an additional 75% (which would take your points reward rate per dollar spent to 2.6!) of the base rewards rate.\n\nCons: Not so much a con as a question of optimizing: if you spend more than $1,500 a month, you're better off with the Capital One Venture Rewards card.\n\nThe Verdict: High paying no fee card, highly recommended for those who either spend less than $1,500/month on their cards, or have an existing Bank of America account.\n\nRecommended Credit: Good to Excellent\n\nMore Details >\n\nSummary\n\nWith so many issuers competing to offer such great incentives, it seems smart to make use of them in the right way!

    "text": "Washington (CNN) Rudy Giuliani called Donald Trump a \"genius\" Sunday, in the wake of a New York Times report indicating he may have legally avoiding paying taxes for nearly two decades.\n\n\"The reality is, this is part of our tax code. The man's a genius. He knows how to operate the tax code to the benefit of the people he's serving,\" the former New York City mayor told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThroughout the contentious interview, Tapper repeatedly pressed Giuliani on his claims that Trump was a \"genius\" and a good businessman based on The New York Times reporting.\n\n\"I think that there are a lot of very, very successful businessmen and women who pay federal income taxes and don't look for every single opportunity there is to avoid paying them,\" Tapper said at one point.\n\nThe New York Times reported Saturday that Trump reported a loss of $916 million on his 1995 tax records -- which, tax experts said, would have allowed Trump to avoid paying income taxes for a period of 18 years.\n\nThe paper did not look at his federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax return as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns.\n\nCNN has not independently verified the documents' authenticity, but Trump's campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by the Times.\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee, has not released his tax returns as is tradition among presidential candidates, claiming they're under IRS audit. There are no legal restrictions against releasing tax returns that are under audit.\n\n\"It shows what a genius he is. It shows he was able to preserve his enterprise and that he was able to build it,\" Giuliani said.\n\nHe insisted Trump isn't to blame for failing to pay federal income taxes.\n\n\"No. The law is responsible for it,\" Giuliani said. \"If you have a set of laws, you live by those laws. And the reality is, you are ignoring completely the fiduciary obligation he has to all the people around him to run his business at the lowest possible expense.\"\n\nRudy Giuliani: Trump did nothing wrong https://t.co/8gCp70yKqp #CNNSOTU https://t.co/1isbgp6grl \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 2, 2016\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who has kept up a drumbeat of Trump attacks over his taxes, said Sunday, \"Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won't release his taxes because they'll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father.\"\n\n\"Despite losing a billion dollars, Trump wants to reward himself with more tax breaks on inherited wealth while stiffing middle-class families who earn their paychecks with hard work,\" Reid said.\n\nIs Trump a good businessman?\n\nTrump has placed his business record at the forefront of his list of qualifications for the presidency.\n\nTapper pressed Giuliani on whether someone who lost $916 billion in one year could reasonably argue he's a good businessman.\n\n\"That doesn't sound brilliant,\" Tapper said.\n\n\"Well, yes it does, because he came back,\" Giuliani said. \"Because he came back, and he came all the way back. And isn't that the history of America? I mean, people like Steve Jobs were fired by Apple and came all the way back. Churchill was thrown out of office twice and came all the way back.\"\n\nAnother top Trump ally, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also called The New York Times' report positive for Trump because, he said, it shows his resiliency.\n\n\"This is a guy who, when lots of businesses went out of business in the early 1990s, he fought and clawed back to build another fortune, to create tens of thousands of more jobs, and this is actually a very, very good story for Donald Trump,\" Christie said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nGiuliani said Trump's personal financial disclosure form filed last year shows Trump made $680 million -- enough that Trump wouldn't have been able to carry over his 1995 losses through 18 years.\n\n\"He hasn't released his tax returns. The only reason we know anything about this is because somebody released this to The New York Times,\" Tapper said.\n\nGiuliani again pointed to Trump's financial disclosure, \"which describes considerably more about his finances than the tax return.\"\n\nTapper said: \"He's the first major party nominee since 1976 to not release his tax returns. If you're proud of that, that's great, but I don't think you should be.\"\n\nAnd Giuliani responded that the scrutiny and attention being paid to The New York Times report \"is a very clear indication of why someone might not want to release their tax returns.\"\n\n\"You take something that is perfectly legal, something he had no choice but to utilize ... and you try to make it into -- he did no wrongdoing. ... He did nothing wrong. The headline should have been, 'Donald Trump takes advantage of legal provisions in tax code,'\" Giuliani said.\n\nChristie said Trump's 1995 tax returns show \"what an absolute mess the federal tax code is.\"\n\n\"There's no one who's shown more genius in their way to maneuver around the tax code and to rightfully use the laws to do that, and he's already promised in his tax plan to change many of these special interest loopholes and get rid of them,\" Christie told Fox News.\n\n'Rather common'\n\nGiuliani, who did not dispute the authenticity of Trump's 1995 tax records and did not say how much Trump has paid in income taxes, said that \"this is rather common in large, gigantic American businesses.\"\n\n\"There aren't very many smart businessmen that don't take advantage of the legal tax laws that are there, and if they are, then they're not very good businessmen,\" Giuliani said.\n\nAnd, he said, \"in fact, 44%, 45% of America doesn't pay any income tax.\"\n\n\"Anybody that goes and has an accountant, H&R Block or just goes online, figures out all the deductions that are available to them. I mean, the reality is that most Americans take advantage of every deduction available to them,\" Giuliani said.\n\nTapper said: \"Most Americans pay federal income taxes though, though, sir, and Donald Trump apparently does not.\"\n\n\"And very large businesses very often take advantage of these kinds of losses,\" Giuliani said.\n\n.@jaketapper asks Rudy Giuliani if he pays income tax, he replies, \"That's between me and my accountant and the IRS\" https://t.co/T6sU6a7L2g \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 2, 2016\n\nTapper then asked Giuliani whether he personally pays income taxes. Giuliani said: \"Well, that's between me and my accountant and the IRS. And the reality is, I pay my lawful tax and he pays his lawful tax.\"\n\nCould Trump be sued?\n\nGiuliani argued that Trump could have faced legal trouble for paying more than necessary in taxes.\n\n\"If he didn't take advantage of those tax deductions of tax advantages that he had, he could be sued, because his obligation as a businessman is to make money for his enterprise and to save money for his enterprise. It would have been insane for him not to take advantage of it,\" he said.\n\nTapper asked: \"Sued by who? Who would sue him for paying personal income taxes?\"\n\n\"Investors in his business, people who loan money to his business, banks that loan money to his business,\" Giuliani said.\n\n\"That's why the simplistic analysis of an extraordinarily complex code is very unfair,\" he said.\n\nTapper responded: \"I think that there are a lot of very, very successful businessmen and women who pay federal income taxes and don't look for every single opportunity there is to avoid paying them.\"\n\n\"There are not very many smart businessmen who don't take advantage of the legal tax laws that are there. And if they are, then they're not very good businessmen and no one wants to go into business with them -- and they don't have very good lawyers or accountants,\" Giuliani said.",

    "text": "Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors, writes frequently for CNN Opinion. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Maybe the third time will be the charm. Just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month, Rep. Xavier Becerra introduced legislation last week in Congress calling for the creation of a National Museum of the American Latino.\n\nProfessional golfer Juan Antonio \"Chi-Chi\" Rodriguez was the first Puerto Rican to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Latino List \u2013 Professional golfer Juan Antonio \"Chi-Chi\" Rodriguez was the first Puerto Rican to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nActor, comedian and producer John Leguizamo is Colombian-American, despite being thought to be Puerto Rican for much of his career.\n\nThe Latino List \u2013 Actor, comedian and producer John Leguizamo is Colombian-American, despite being thought to be Puerto Rican for much of his career.\n\nThe Latino List \u2013 Ralph de la Vega is president and CEO of AT&T Mobility and also a native of Cuba.\n\nA new study examines the diverse Latino identity in the United States. \"The Latino List\" is a documentary and photo exhibit that reflects a diverse group of accomplished Latinos who reveal their personal stories in intimate interviews. This selection of photos captured by photographer and director Timothy Greenfield-Sanders shows a range of identities. Singer, songwriter and actress Gloria Estefan is Cuban-American. \" The Latino List: Photographs by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders \" is on view at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta now through May 19, 2013.\n\nThe proposed new museum would be part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Becerra has tried three times to get this project off the ground, because the California Democrat believes the Smithsonian underserves US Latinos. \"There's no better way to learn what it means to be an American than to spend time on the Mall and in the dozen or so Smithsonian museums,\" he said . \"But if you do, you'll walk away without having an understanding of what it means to be an American of Latino descent.\"\n\nA National Museum of the American Latino is an idea that makes sense. Latinos have long been overlooked by the Smithsonian Institution and deserve a showcase for our culture and history. The proposed new museum would enrich the experience of Smithsonian visitors.\n\nMost Americans probably do not know that the nation's first successful school desegregation case centered on Mexican-Americans in San Diego in 1931, or that Latinos fought on both sides during the Civil War. Latinos such as the late Pedro E. Guerrero , the foremost photographer of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, and pioneering journalist Ruben Salazar , whom law enforcement killed in East Los Angeles in 1970, are worthy of more public recognition -- and not just during Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\nThe need for a national Latino museum is acute given that Latinos are often portrayed negatively or erased in our society. The Texas State Board of Education is currently giving consideration to a Mexican-American studies textbook that has been described as \" dripping with racism.\n\nThis month, a University of Southern California study on diversity in Hollywood found that Latinos continued to be underrepresented in film and TV. The nominee of a major presidential party has described Mexicans and immigrants as drug dealers and rapists. A standing national Latino museum could help counter such stereotypes by educating people about the contributions of Latinos to this country.\n\nThe Smithsonian is the world's largest museum, educational and research complex. One of the four priorities in its mission statement is \"understanding the American experience.\"\n\nBut historically, the institution has not done a good job of recognizing -- let alone understanding -- how the country's 55 million Latinos fit into the American experience. In 1994, a Smithsonian task force found that the institution \" displayed a pattern of willful neglect \" toward Hispanics in collections, governance, personnel and resource allocation. The chairman of the task force, Raul Yzaguirre, said this meant that visitors \"get a warped, distorted view of America.\"\n\nAs a result, in 1997 the Center for Latino Initiatives was created. Now known as the Smithsonian Latino Center , it sponsors exhibitions and curates an online gallery. While its work is thoughtful and engaging, it is no substitute for a physical building where visitors can learn about Latinos. Consider that the Smithsonian complex recorded more than 28 million visits last year , and most of these people likely had a richer, deeper experience than they could receive by scrolling online.\n\nThe Smithsonian already recognizes contributions by other groups. The National Museum of the American Indian opened in 2004, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture opens Saturday. Given our rise in numbers and influence, Latinos deserve a museum where we can see ourselves showcased as well. To be clear, however, this would not be a museum for Latinos alone. It would be for all visitors to share in the history and culture of Hispanic Americans.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe time is right to go forward on the idea of a Latino museum because bringing such a project to completion is a long process. (Congress approved the National Museum of African American History and Culture 13 years ago.)\n\nBecerra also has bipartisan support for his proposal, which is co-sponsored in the House by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, and in the Senate by John Cornyn, R-Texas. The proposed museum would rely on a combination of public and private funds, and would not require a new building because it would go into an existing structure, the Arts and Industries Building, now used for special programs on the National Mall.\n\nTrue, critics of a national Latino museum have said that represents a balkanization of the Smithsonian.\n\n\"I don't want a situation where whites go to the original museum, African-Americans go the African-American museum, Indians go to the Indian museum, and Hispanics go to the Latino museum,\" then-Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia, told The New York Times in 2011 . \"That's not America.\"\n\nYet the proposed museum might not have been necessary had Latinos not been excluded from representation in the Smithsonian for so long. More importantly, the renewed effort for the National Museum of the American Latino is not about Latinos being a separate part of the Smithsonian. It is about Latinos being fully part of this esteemed institution. As Becerra said , \"The more we give people the chance to see what it means to be an American Latino, the better off we are.\"\n\nLatinos deserve full inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution. The National Museum of the American Latino represents an opportunity for Latinos and all Americans to take pride in our shared heritage.",

That kicks off this week with premieres of \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"The Exorcist,\" two series derived from familiar movies.\n\nHaving already spawned a quartet of films from 1987 to 1998, \"Lethal Weapon\" lends itself more to making the leap, and hasn't tinkered much with the existing formula. By contrast, \"The Exorcist\" was essentially a title in search of a show, and it's still not entirely clear what to expect beyond the spooky but somewhat messy and scattered pilot.\n\n\"Lethal Weapon\" casts Clayne Crawford (\"Rectify\") in the role of Martin Riggs, the cop who suffered a devastating personal loss and now acts like he wants to die, allowing him to chase bad guys with utterly reckless abandon. He's paired with Roger Murtaugh (Damon Wayans), a family man who has already experienced a brush with his mortality and isn't eager to have another. So much for coasting toward retirement.\n\nDamon Wayans and Clayne Crawford in \"Lethal Weapon\"\n\nFor these purposes, casting was half the battle, and there's a nice rapport between the two leads. That said, there's nothing particularly distinctive about the show -- including the ample action and shootouts -- and it risks quickly blending into the roster of buddy-cop dramas that Fox has trotted out with numbing regularity over the last few years.\n\n\"The Exorcist\" faces a thornier challenge, and tries tackling it with slightly more ambition and style, but less clarity.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) Inside Senegal's state penitentiary, jailed minors form an orderly queue. They are being driven away from the prison in Thi\u00e8s to enter a studio and fight.\n\nSenegal is experimenting with a new form of restorative justice where these child prisoners - whose offenses range from violence to theft - are being taught to fence in twice-weekly classes that take place outside of prison walls.\n\nThe aim? Teach the kids how to follow rules and regulations once they are released from prison.\n\nThe program was developed by Association Pour le Sourire d'un Enfant (ASE) working with Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA).\n\nWhile fencing may seem aggressive, officials with these groups say it's taught the children, ages 13 to 17, how to respect each other and deal with sometimes losing matches.\n\nJUST WATCHED Senegal introduces Olympic fencing to jailed minors Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senegal introduces Olympic fencing to jailed minors 00:40\n\n\"There are a lot of rules in fencing,\" explains program manager Hawa Ba, \" [but] it's a sport that is helping you regain your self esteem.\"\n\nWhen the concept was first proposed, many involved had reservations.\n\n\"They were like, 'This fencing, what is it?'\" laughed Ba. \"Because it was really unconventional, and the first time we were doing something like it.\"\n\nThe white attire, the mask, rites and rules - no other sport can bring together all these elements.\n\nSenegal's Ministry of Justice was also worried about giving weapons to minors, some convicted of stabbings, as well as the risk of prisoners escaping when traveling to sessions.\n\nBut Nelly Robin, who came up with idea, was resolute.\n\n\"The weapon, the white attire, the mask, rites and rules, and situations of combat and arbitration. No other sport can bring together all these elements,\" said the ASE founder. \"The gradual change in behavior of jailed minors in the detention space and during hearings has convinced all prison staff and magistrates of its merits.\"\n\nCurrently Senegal's prison population of children stands at 1,780, according to a recent UN report . The country's excessive use of detention for minor offenses has drawn criticism.\n\n\"It's working with the justice system to work out how we can evolve our laws and regulations to have a justice system that is more inline with human rights standards in general,\" said Ba.\n\nPrison guard fencers?\n\nPrison guard Fatoumata Sy referees a fencing match between minors.\n\nPrison guards are taught fencing and in turn act as trainers during sessions with the children. Ba notes that this permanently changes the dynamics of the relationship from that of prison guards who are there \"to punish you when you do something wrong or somebody watching you to make sure that you don't run away\" to something quite different where prison guards are akin to social workers. Children learn to trust them.\n\nSenegal's incarated youths begin warm up practice before fencing sessions start.\n\nIt's an important distinction in the relationship, she notes, and indicative of a wider problem in Senegal: that many of its prisoners are there for social offenses. In the co-ed classes, \"most of the girls are in prison because of abortion (which is criminalized in Senegal) or infanticide because they got pregnant and they tried to get rid of the baby after they gave birth.\"\n\nOthers turned out on the streets by parents unable to handle their violent behaviors undoubtedly move onto petty crime.\n\n\"The children are not the problem,\" Ba told CNN. \" It's something wrong with the system.\"\n\nJudges are involved in the project, which has had an impact on the way cases are handled upon review.\n\n\"In many cases, offenses have been [commuted] to less harsh or shorter sentences,\" added Ba.\n\nCommanding respect\n\n16-year-old Samba hopes to one day become a trainer.\n\nChild beggars also take part in classes and practice alongside incarcerated youths. So far, more than 100 jailed children have been through the studio doors. A longer-term strategy is for the kids to become trainers themselves, which will give them paid occupations when released.\n\nCurrently, fencing has only been introduced in Thi\u00e8s, which lies about 70 kilometers from Dakar, Senegal's capital, but an ambitious plan hopes to introduce it in all juvenile prisons. A module on fencing is being introduced to all prison officer trainees by the Justice department, later this year.\n\n\"It's gone beyond our expectations,\" Ba said. \"Especially to have the central prison administration systems buy into it and have prison officials designated to be a part of it.\"\n\n\"Within the classes themselves, girls have discovered their capacity to command respect,\" notes Robin. \"And boys have learned to respect them.\"",

Please tag #CNNiReport in your message.\n\n(CNN) As Hurricane Matthew sets its sights on the US, more than 2 million people have already been urged to flee their homes, with more evacuations likely as the deadly storm makes its way past the Bahamas.\n\nState officials in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia cautioned residents not to hunker down at home if they live in the hurricane's potential path.\n\nNot all of the millions of people in Matthew's path have been ordered to leave, but the mandatory evacuations are the largest since Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast from North Carolina to New York in 2012.\n\nEarly Thursday the hurricane, which already has killed at least 15 people in several Caribbean countries, was about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, and 255 miles (410 kilometers) from West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center isn't saying that Matthew will make landfall in Florida, but that the center of the storm will get \"very near\" the Atlantic Coast, possibly as a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nMatthew was packing 125 mph (205 kph) winds as the eye neared the northwest Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nPresident Barack Obama warned Americans in the storm's path to pay attention and take any evacuation orders seriously. He said if the core of the storm strikes Florida, it could have a \"devastating effect.\"\n\nPhotos: Hurricane Matthew approaches US coast after hitting Caribbean Shoppers clear shelves at a supermarket in Titusville, Florida, as Hurricane Matthew churns towards the US coast, October 5, 2016. Thousands of people potentially in the path of Hurricane Matthew fled inland Wednesday, as parts of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina issued mandatory evacuations for areas most likely to be affected.

He said as many as 200,000 people will leave Thursday.\n\nTempers apparently flared during the slow traffic out of Charleston. A man got out of his truck at point where vehicles were being redirected, removed a traffic cone and sped away. Police chased the man until he stopped on a dead-end road.

    "text": "Megyn Kelly and Sean Hannity, who have back-to-back shows on Fox News, have a sharp difference of opinion about Donald Trump.\n\nThe disagreement spilled into the open on Wednesday night when Kelly pointed out Trump's decision to stick with pro-Trump interviewers like Hannity.\n\nKelly's observation was accurate and straightforward -- Trump has been avoiding all but the friendliest of interview forums. But Hannity shot back with a tweet to her, saying, \"u should be mad at @HillaryClinton. Clearly you support her.\"\n\nKelly prides herself on her independence, so Hannity's blunt accusation that she is a Hillary Clinton supporter shocked some observers of the Twitter tiff.\n\nKelly chose not to reply to Hannity.\n\nWhile intramural cable news feuds happen from time to time, this one involves two of Fox's best-known and best-paid hosts.\n\nKelly's contract is due to expire in mid-2017 and Fox's owners, the Murdochs, are keen to keep her at the network. Hannity's contract extends through 2020.\n\nA Fox News spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday night.\n\nWhen asked by CNNMoney to elaborate on his tweet, Hannity replied with a blank email.\n\nKelly, a take-no-prisoners journalist, and Hannity, and a devoted conservative commentator, embody two co-existing but competitive versions of Fox News.\n\nThe two prime time hosts have had a cordial relationship in the past, which makes Wednesday's insulting tweet from Hannity all the more intriguing.\n\nHannity finished his tweet by saying, \"@realDonaldTrump did talk to u.\"\n\n@megynkelly u should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to u. https://t.co/vsQiNMgHut \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 6, 2016\n\nIndeed, Kelly interviewed Trump in May, burying the hatchet after Trump targeted her for criticism for the better part of a year.\n\nSince then, however, Trump has declined Kelly's interview requests. In recent months the GOP nominee has avoided most other TV journalists, preferring to speak with a select group of Fox News interviewers who have opinion shows on the channel.\n\nHannity, Bill O'Reilly and the co-hosts of \"Fox & Friends\" are in this group.\n\nRelated: Trump's appeal to Hannity highlights his conservative media bubble\n\nAs a result, there's a divide within Fox News, between the Trump-friendly interviewers and the other hosts and journalists he declines to talk with.\n\nKelly's point, on Wednesday's edition of her 9 p.m. show \"The Kelly File,\" was that this media strategy may backfire on Trump. Political and media analysts have made similar arguments recently.\n\n\"Donald Trump, with all due respect to my friend at 10, will go on Hannity, and pretty much only Hannity, and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days, which doesn't exactly expand the tent,\" Kelly said.\n\nAs Mediaite reported right after it happened, Kelly also called out Clinton for limiting her TV interviews. She specifically mentioned a Clinton appearance on \"The Steve Harvey Show\" that was partly scripted by the daytime talk show's producers. The Washington Free Beacon obtained a memo about the interview production and wrote about it on Wednesday.\n\nKelly has been lobbying for an interview with Clinton all year long.\n\nKelly's comments on Wednesday came in the context of an interview with Stuart Stevens, a top strategist on Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign.\n\nStevens told CNNMoney in August that Trump's regular appearances on shows like Hannity were akin to \"driving in loops around a cul de sac\" because \"he's selling to the people who have already bought the product.\"\n\nStevens pointed out that Trump was \"only doing friendly voices on Fox,\" adding, \"He's not sitting down with Megyn Kelly, other than that one time in May. He's not sitting down with Chris Wallace. It's just a comfort zone. It's what he has done during the whole campaign -- he's doing what is comfortable.\"\n\nRelated: Fox News note commenting on Jesse Watters' controversial Chinatown segment\n\nHannity had the first televised conversation with Trump after the first Trump-Clinton debate last week.

    "text": "(CNN) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer their take on Tuesday night's vice presidential candidate debate. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.\n\nDavid Gergen: Pence Lifts GOP Spirits\n\nGovernor Mike Pence did not change the underlying dynamics of the campaign Tuesday night, but he did provide a significant service to Donald Trump: he gave fresh heart to Trump supporters and may have stopped the downward spiral of their campaign.\n\nDemocrats and many journalists argue that Pence succeeded only by throwing Trump under the bus, refusing to defend his boss from repeated attacks. But they miss the point: voters rarely scrutinize debates line-by-line, instead making their judgments on the overall tone and performance of a candidate. Pence will not fare well with fact checkers, but his poise and polish played well with voters. For better or worse, style counts a lot in these debates.\n\nTim Kaine had a much sharper mastery of policy but was forced to play attack dog, a role that doesn't fit his personality. His frequent interruptions didn't help, either -- he seemed less Rottweiler than fox terrier. And by the way, who screwed up his camera angle, so that he was often looking off into space instead of talking directly to viewers? That wasn't fair to him or the audience.\n\nWith a CNN poll showing a Pence victory, Republicans finally have reason to cheer again. Trump himself should see how much preparation paid off for his running mate. But now it is up to the candidate to show he can win at this game, too: the upcoming debate this Sunday in St. Louis is make or break for Trump.\n\nDavid Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been a White House adviser to four presidents. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. Follow him @david_gergen . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\nSally Kohn: Mike Pence is living on an alternate planet\n\nSally Kohn\n\nWell it turns out, if you refuse to acknowledge any of the horrible things that Donald Trump has actually said, then it's pretty easy to defend him.\n\nThis was the main takeaway from the vice presidential debate. Over and over again, Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine tried valiantly to hold Republican Mike Pence accountable for the misogynistic, xenophobic, anti-Muslim, pro-Putin things that his running mate Donald Trump has said. And over and over again, Pence acted like Kaine was not only making these things up but, in so doing, actually perpetrating a campaign of insults simply by repeating the things that Donald Trump had said yet Mike Pence refused to acknowledge. I'm pretty impressed that Kaine's head didn't explode. Mine certainly came close.\n\nI don't know how you debate someone who seems to have encamped himself on a different planet. Yet to his credit, Mike Pence dished out his flurry of lies with calm confidence -- while Tim Kaine, the truth-teller, came off as ruffled.\n\nIn a moment in American media and political history where the very existence let alone definition of \"facts\" seems worryingly debatable, I pray that the American people can still tell the difference. Or else I pray that not that many people were watching \u2014 and that the morning-after media will do its job of fact checking Pence for his downright lies and thus the impression most voters will walk away will be one closer to -- well, fact.\n\nFacts are facts. We have literal recordings and transcripts.\n\nBut if anything, the VP debate tests the relevance of facts in this election. Donald Trump and Mike Pence's strategy seems to be to repeat lies often enough to convince 51% of voters that they're the truth. And unfortunately, what actually is true doesn't matter as much as what voters believe to be true. Donald Trump has already bent the electoral process, the media and the boundaries of basic civility to his whims. He may now bend the concept of fact as well. Certainly, his loyal running mate is trying.\n\nSally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn . She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency.\n\nErrol Louis: Pence gives lesson on how to defend Trump\n\nErrol Louis\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence went into Tuesday's vice presidential debate burdened with saving the Trump campaign after one of its worst weeks. He emerged as the calmer, smoother counterpart to the erratic performance by Donald Trump during last week's debate.\n\nPence's skillful performance was, in part, a product of the five years he spent as a radio talk show host, a job that put a premium on maintaining a clear and conversational tone and timing.\n\nTo make his burden easier, Pence made as few references as possible to Trump, dancing around criticisms about his running mate's tax returns, insults to a former Miss Universe and the constitutionality of his \"extreme vetting\" plans. Instead, he spent the bulk of the night smoothing out what he dismissed as misinterpretations of Trump's proposals.\n\nEven if he didn't fully answer questions on race relations and questions on Trump's business acumen, Pence was the cooler alternative to Sen. Tim Kaine, who came off as canned, too-clever and nervous, interrupting Pence throughout the debate.\n\nPence calmly dismissed assertions from Kaine with a chuckle, calling his points nonsense. That won't eliminate all the political damage Trump has done with his nonstop insults and mockery, but it demonstrated to other Trump supporters how to defend their candidate without doubling down on his abrasive style.\n\nS.E. Cupp: Kaine gave tone deaf, unhinged performance\n\nS.E. Cupp\n\nJust wow. Tim Kaine had one (fairly simple) job tonight: make the Donald Trump ticket look like the unstable one. Instead, for reasons only the late Miss Cleo might know, he was the one who was totally out of control.\n\nSure, he laid out the differences between Trump and Hillary Clinton, hammered away at Trump's rhetoric and asked numerous times how Mike Pence could defend some of Trump's words and proposals. But who could hear any of that through the cacophony of hyperactive, ballistic outbursts and interruptions that marked most of the conversation?\n\nAt one point, Pence mentioned 9/11 and Kaine interrupted to excitedly announce, \"I was there, too, by the Pentagon!\" When he wasn't interrupting, he was steamrolling through prepared paragraphs of alliterative dad jokes and scripted zingers that might have been effective -- if they weren't delivered at warp speed. And he was so wedded to his anti-Trump mandate, he often seemed oblivious. In an answer to a question about the children of Syria -- let me repeat, the CHILDREN OF SYRIA -- his response was to point out that Trump didn't pay his taxes.\n\nWhatever substantive points Kaine made about Trump's unpreparedness -- and there were many, and they were important -- were totally overshadowed by Kaine's tone deaf, overly caffeinated, unhinged performance, especially when contrasted with Pence's calm and composed one. If undecided voters were watching, Pence by far seemed the saner choice, maybe even in spite of his running mate.\n\nS.E. Cupp is the author of \" Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,\" co-author of \" Why You're Wrong About the Right \" and a columnist at the New York Daily News.\n\nTara Setmayer: Debate won't move needle\n\nTara Setmayer\n\nDespite finishing a bit weaker than he started, Mike Pence was able to successfully execute his strategy better than Tim Kaine. Pence was unflappable throughout, while deliberately choosing to avoid answering any direct questions about his running mate's litany of controversial remarks and positions.\n\nBy design, Pence took every opportunity to make the question a referendum on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's failed policies regardless of the question asked. This tactic forced Tim Kaine to play defense most of the evening.\n\nKaine was at his best when he listed many of Trump's controversial statements and then challenged Pence multiple times to defend them, which he didn't for the most part. However, Kaine's incessant interruptions were off putting and undermined his own message.\n\nAlthough Pence emerged the victor overall, it won't move the needle at all for voters. Vice presidential debates rarely do. In this case, it simply reminded many Republicans how much different this race would be if a knowledgeable Republican who could effectively articulate the issues were at the top of the ticket instead of a self-aggrandizing demagogue like Trump.\n\nTara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, and a CNN political commentator. Follow her on Twitter @tarasetmayer.\n\nTim Stanley: Pence delivers pleasingly banal performance\n\nTimothy Stanley\n\nNow, that was the kind of polite and intelligent debate we used not to watch. Yes, the VP encounter was feisty, but never personally offensive -- and its substance also felt incredibly old fashioned. The separation of church and state, a subject never mentioned in Trump v Clinton, was tactfully addressed; memories of 9/11 were invoked; both candidates agreed that Russia is a strategic threat. In fact, Mike Pence's performance was so old school Republican that he seemed unaware of the reality of Trump's iconoclastic campaign. \"Yes, I am happy to defend Mr. Trump,\" he insisted, adding that Hillary Clinton was the lady with all the insults and Trump was a great and honest businessman. He was defending the Trump of his imagination.\n\nKaine gave a spirited performance that was, to his detriment, wholly negative. If he couldn't say \"But your candidate said XYZ!\" then he wouldn't have had much to say at all. Pence defused the antagonism with the wry smile of a genial old man humoring a simpleton -- and won most rounds. He scored highly on law and order, insisting that there's no contradiction between acknowledging that police racism exists and refusing to exploit tragedy for votes.\n\nSo effective was his performance, so pleasingly banal, that many Republicans will be calling for the ticket to be switched. They do so forgetting that Trump's radicalism deflects but does not diminish Pence's: He was once considered a politically incorrect conservative himself, and any other year would have been regarded as a risky choice for VP.\n\nSo this debate reinforced the impression that while the Democrat ticket is weak and unlikeable, the Republican one is eccentric. Pence, undeniably effective, won in large part by not being as bizarre as his running mate. Any momentum gained will doubtless be squandered by Trump himself.\n\nTimothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain's Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \"Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.\"\n\nJeff Yang: Pence edges non-event\n\nJeff Yang\n\nThe overwhelming feeling one was left with after the first and only televised \"Second Chair Debate\" was pointlessness verging on nihilism. Yes, each debater \"landed hits\" and \"scored points.\" But the debate will almost certainly have no meaningful or lasting effect on this particular election.\n\nWhat we saw in Tim Kaine was a friendly, loyal, bland but upstanding (upblanding?) politician who ably filled his role as Hillary Clinton's staunch defender, but who fell a bit short in executing the other half of his job, as the ticket's designated attack dog. A bit too eager out of the gate, and nearly edgeless in his delivery, Kaine appeared to be more of a frantic puppy than a partisan pit bull. Still, he managed to come off as both human and humane, and certainly did no harm to the Democrats' prospects.\n\nMike Pence, as others have remarked, was another story. Though he came off as articulate and informed, and far more measured and thoughtful-seeming than his shoot-from-the-lip running mate, he did Donald Trump no favors as wingman. When pressed to respond to questions about Trump's extensive lies, utter lack of transparency and fractal conflicts of interest, Pence simply evaded and dodged until moderator Elaine Quijano was forced to move on, causing the Republican to visibly exhale in relief. What we were left with was the sense that Pence sees Trump as a stepping stone to his own ambitions; that he's playing for 2020, not 2016.\n\nIn the end, Pence may have eked out a \"victory\" in this sideshow, but hardly the overwhelming one the GOP accidentally predicted when it uploaded a prewritten Pence wins debate post on its website -- before the debate actually began. Yet another sign of the lack of significance assigned to this non-event, and one we perhaps should have heeded.\n\nJeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal and a frequent contributor to radio shows including Public Radio International's \"The Takeaway\" and WNYC's \"The Brian Lehrer Show.\" He is the co-author of \"I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action\" and editor of the graphic novel anthologies \"Secret Identities\" and \"Shattered.\"\n\nNayyera Haq: Kaine, Pence and the battle for white voters\n\nNayyera Haq\n\nIt was supposed to be a boring match-up between two men viewed as milquetoast leaders playing second fiddle to the more media-friendly politicians at the top of the ticket.\n\nMost of us have known Hillary Clinton's running mate as Uncle Tim with the jokes, and Mike Pence as the tortured soul trying to add respectability to Trump's maverick campaign. Tim Kaine broke expectations, showing us the sharp leader who helped heal his state after the Virginia Tech massacre. Poor Mike Pence was stuck toggling between playing cleanup for Trump's missteps and staking out substantive policy positions his boss still hasn't clearly defined.\n\nBut the biggest surprise was how this debate exposed the looming cultural choice facing white men in this election. Trump lost women and minority voters ages ago -- Latinos, and African-Americans -- not just with his flippant misogynistic and racist comments, but his doubling down in defense of policies that reflect those deplorable values.\n\nYet, Tuesday's debate drew a sharp contrast between the two tickets, laying bare the choice facing white, middle class voters using two people who look just like them.\n\nKaine made the case for how white men can back a woman for President, support local police while believing racial bias exists, and hold personal religious values dear while not pushing them on the broader public. Kaine used Trump's tax record to hammer home that Trump cannot relate to middle class economic struggles.\n\nPence helped Republicans feel their conservative values were still present in this election, shoring up evangelical support for Trump, but doing nothing to appeal to a broader undecided audience. In a year that has often pitted white families against minorities in politics and in social justice movements, Tim Kaine made the stronger case for a broader coalition of American values.\n\nNayyera Haq is a former White House Senior Director and State Department spokesperson under the Obama administration, Nayyera is a regular commentator on politics and current affairs.

Both Mike Pence and Tim Kaine hammered at the opposing side's would-be president. Overall, substantive policy discussions took a rear seat to the back and forth of political attacks -- and personal insults -- directed at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This was a proxy battle, with each surrogate taking the biggest swings at the other team's presidential nominee.\n\nAs for the head-to-head aspect of it, Pence won the debate against Kaine. In tone and style, he came across as more measured, poised and statesmanlike. Pence also made a much more coherent case against Hillary Clinton -- both on her record and her judgment -- than anything Trump pulled together in the first debate. Pence had much more difficulty defending Trump's record, however, as he often was left shaking his head without a response when asked about a specific Trump quote.\n\nKaine was in full assault mode the whole time. His supporters probably enjoyed this, but stylistically he came across as rude, snippy and snide. He constantly interrupted Pence, engaged in so much crosstalk that it was difficult to know what anyone was saying, and repeated an endless string of talking points meant to undermine the Republican nominee while skipping over the moderator's questions whenever Clinton's weaknesses were at issue.\n\nIt's unlikely the debate will sway many voters in any direction, but perhaps Kaine and Pence's feisty exchange is a prelude to a much more fiery event coming up between Trump and Clinton this Sunday.\n\nBuck Sexton is a political commentator for CNN and host of \"The Buck Sexton Show\" on TheBlaze .

They just didn't sound very much like those of his current boss, Donald Trump.\n\nThe most startling of all was Pence's talk about Vladimir Putin, \"the small, bullying leader of Russia,\" as Pence called him.\n\nTrump has praised Putin's leadership qualities and warmly embraced the Russian autocrat throughout the campaign. A few weeks ago, during the Commander-in-Chief forum, Trump told Matt Lauer that Putin, \"says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him.\" Then he went on to rave about Putin's high approval ratings. That's the same Putin that Pence claims his team wants to forcefully take on.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nOn Syria, Pence outlined a policy that does not resemble any of what Trump has said. Trump has spoken of attacking ISIS and leaving in place the dictator Bashar al-Assad, responsible for far more deaths than ISIS. By contrast, Pence declared that American leadership requires it protect vulnerable citizens, including the children of Aleppo. Compare that to Trump's tone on Muslims in general.\n\nPence did make an effort to defend his running mate, but it was a bizarre tactic. When his challenger, Governor Tim Kaine, quoted Trump's own highly offensive words, Pence repeatedly shook his head as if saying no, and laughed, appearing to deny the quotes that were almost all quite accurate. Then, when his turn came to speak, he did not refute Kaine's statements citing Trump's own words.\n\nBut then, at one point, he did refute them. Kaine listed a series of Trump insults that all Americans have heard; attacks against a Mexican judge, disdain for John McCain being captured in Vietnam, and others. Incredibly, Pence seemed to deny the words everyone has heard. \"If Donald Trump had said all the things you said he said in the way he's said them,\" he said, it would still not compare to Hillary Clinton's \"basket of deplorables.\"\n\nPence tried to paint Clinton as the one responsible for running an \"insult-driven campaign.\" But Americans have heard Trump. Pence's smooth debate skills cannot erase that.\n\nAnother Pence excuse, this one on abortion, won't cut it. Trump told Chris Mathews that \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for women who have abortions.\" Pence excused it saying Trump is \"not a polished politician.\"\n\nPence is a polished politician. It showed in the debate. But he failed to defend Trump's policies.\n\nFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent.

Cirdan chose wisely: While Gandalf would rally men and elves against Sauron's evil, Saruman not only conceded to tyranny, but embraced it.\n\nIf there's a reason Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" endures, it's because it isn't really fantasy. It is a kind of scripture. I'm not claiming Donald Trump is Sauron. I am, however, arguing that we can get an insight into what happened to Mike Pence by seeing how great writers explore the effect of power on the human soul.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine repeatedly cited Trump's most egregious comments, but all Pence did was deny Trump ever said any such thing. We have a non-focus grouped term for that. Lying. Pence may have lied more than Trump did, and that's a historic achievement.\n\nSo whether Pence loses the debate in the court of public opinion is secondary. Whether he becomes vice president almost does not matter. Pence's dishonesty is not just spiritually toxic, but socially radioactive. If the top of your ticket indulges anti-Semitism, moots war crimes, mocks veterans, shames women, and mines Breitbart for campaign direction, then you're no different.\n\nWhat difference does it make if you're not a racist, but you want a racist to become president? Donald Trump was the test God placed before Mike Pence, and he failed. That's so much worse than losing.\n\nHaroon Moghul is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy.

Chen\n\nMike Pence delivered a performance Tuesday night that left conservatives swooning and may have fueled the consolidation of Republican support for Trump.\n\nHe successfully prosecuted the case against Hillary Clinton, remained cool even under constant interruptions from Tim Kaine, and articulated a conservative vision of governance in the post-Obama era.\n\nSome conservatives (including me) are left wondering how different this electoral cycle might be if Pence was at the top of the ticket instead. But while Pence's performance Tuesday evening will be a bright spot in what has otherwise been an abysmal stretch for the Trump campaign, it's not immediately clear whether a vice presidential debate will impact the race more broadly. And over the next week, the Trump campaign will surely be asked to reconcile the differences in policy positions articulated by Pence and Trump on areas such as U.S. policy toward Russia and Syria.\n\nIt's ultimately up to Trump to turn in a better performance on Sunday in St. Louis and again when he and Hillary Clinton debate in Las Vegas on October 19, if he wants to alter the trajectory of his own campaign. And, at the end of the day, while Pence presented very well, he's not the one running for president.\n\nLanhee J.

Tuesday night, though, Pence demonstrated that he can best even Trump in the fine art of denial. Pence smoothly denied documented statements and actions by Trump, or else refuted the existence of the issue altogether. \"Ours is an insult-driven campaign?\" Pence asked, as though he'd never heard anything so ludicrous.\n\nMost notably, Pence refused to talk about Trump's racism. Pence sidestepped a question from moderator Elaine Quijano about the black Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina being stopped multiple times by police, and dismissed notions of implicit bias as \"badmouthing\" law enforcement. He chided Kaine for \"whipping out that Mexican thing again,\" as though calling Mexicans rapists should be no big deal.\n\nPence's astonishing ability to deny everything perfectly expresses the GOP leadership's refusal to acknowledge what they have unleashed in America by nominating Trump. It helps to soothe the consciences of Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain, and all others who refuse to retract their endorsement of this rogue individual, no matter what he says or does.\n\nNext to Pence, Kaine came off as irascible and unable to stop his interrupting and over talk. Pence won this debate, but Americans will be the losers if he and Trump prevail on November 8.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, a specialist in 20th-century European history and a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion.

Two career public servants met on the debate stage to argue about who was more \"establishment.\" Yet the challenge? Nobody knows their names.\n\nTuesday night, the two VP candidates had an opportunity to be the chief spokespersons for their leaders while simultaneously assisting the American public in getting to know them better. Early on, I got the sense that Mike Pence laughed to keep from crying the entire night. I also thought his smug appearance, constant head shaking, and outcry that Tim Kaine's mere repetition of Trump's words were \"nonsense,\" was condescension and arrogance.\n\nPence is probably wondering how he got here (until he realizes he was not likely to win a gubernatorial re-election anyway). He kept saying Kaine's statements were nonsense. His strategy was simple: say everything Kaine says about Trump is ridiculous -- pray you don't get fact checked.\n\nKaine would have one upped if he had said: \"you're absolutely right. Your candidate's disregard for humanity and dangerous rhetoric is nonsense -- that nonsense has an audience and it has become poisonous and violent.\"\n\nThere were so many missed moments starting with the moderator: if she was fact checking, Kaine wouldn't be the only one cutting Pence off.\n\nAngela Rye is a CNN political commentator, NPR political analyst and CEO of IMPACT Strategies, a political advocacy firm in Washington. She is also a former Congressional Black Caucus executive director and general counsel. She supports Hillary Clinton. You can follow her on Twitter @angela_rye and on Instagram @angelarye\n\nRaul Reyes: Governor... please\n\nRaul Reyes\n\n\"Governor, please.\" Those were the words of moderator Elaine Quijano, midway through the debate, as she tried to keep Mike Pence from interrupting his rival Tim Kaine. She could well have been articulating the thoughts of millions of American viewers, who might be excused for thinking that Pence did not know his running mate was actually Donald Trump. Time and again, Pence seemed most annoyed when Kaine recited Trump's own words back to him.\n\nIn the \"Battle of the Dads\" Tuesday night, Tim Kaine came prepared to fight -- and he clearly won the evening's face-off. The sparkle in his eye as he landed his jabs contrasted nicely with Pence's monotone delivery and occasional flashes of annoyance. Kaine pounded Pence with Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, his murky ties to Russia, and his misogynistic and anti-Latino comments. Kaine drove these points so repeatedly and strongly that at one point Pence sighed with irritation and said, \"You've whipped out that Mexican thing again.\" Does he not realize that \"that Mexican thing\" is one reason Trump is hitting historic lows with Latino voters?\n\nKaine was fiercely on-message tonight. He did a good job in laying out the stark differences between Clinton and Trump on immigration, calling Trump's plan \"Deportation Nation.\" He crystallized the complicated abortion issue into one simple question, asking Pence why he didn't trust women to make their reproductive choices themselves.\n\nStill, Kaine failed to bring up one of Pence's vulnerabilities -- his history of anti-LGBT legislation cloaked as religious freedom. At a time when marriage equality is the law of the land and most Americans -- especially young people -- support LGBT rights, this was money left on the table. Kaine also missed the opportunity to mention the fact that Pence has accepted the Medicaid expansion in his state under the the Affordable Care Act -- something at odds with Trump's opposition to \"Obamacare.\"\n\nFor his part, Pence struggled to explain how the Trump tax plans would benefit all Americans. He completely avoided Quijano's question about dealing with homegrown terrorism, and when asked about North Korea nuclear policy, pivoted to discussing the Clinton Foundation. Tellingly, one moment when Pence did not have anything to say was when Kaine brought up Trump's attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American heritage. Here, Pence's silence spoke volumes.\n\nTo be fair, Pence had the unenviable job of attempting to do damage control after Trump's disastrous debate performance last month. But he really didn't do himself any favors in the credibility department when he accused the Clinton/Kaine ticket of running an \"insult-driven campaign.\" The facts say otherwise -- \"Crooked Hillary\" comes to mind -- as even causal observers of the presidential race know. As moderator Quijano might say, \"Governor... please.\"\n\nRaul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him @RaulAReyes\n\nJulian Zelizer: The start of Pence 2020?\n\nJulian Zelizer\n\nBoth campaigns will find something to be pleased about with the debate. If Clinton wanted an in-your-face attack dog, Tim Kaine answered the call. He took some tough shots at Donald Trump and everything that the Republican campaign has supported. He reiterated most of the key talking points from the campaign, right from the start of the night.\n\nWhen Mike Pence brought up the Clinton Foundation, Kaine turned the conversation to what he sees as the much more egregious and less altruistic nature of the Trump Foundation.\n\nMost importantly, Kaine forced Pence into the uncomfortable position of being challenged to defend Trump's most outrageous, polemical and insulting comments about women, Mexicans and Muslims. Mostly Pence side-stepped the points Kaine made.\n\n\"I'm just saying facts about your candidate, and you can't defend him,\" Kaine said when Pence complained about their \"insult-driven\" campaign.\n\nBut Pence achieved his goal in this debate, which was simply to provide some positive coverage for the Republican ticket and offer an image of the ticket that differs from everything Trump has conveyed. Of course, the bar was low after Trump's performance in the first debate. Throughout most of the back-and-forth, Pence appeared calmer and more deliberative than his opponent. If Kaine wanted to provoke him in the same way that Clinton did with Trump, he was not able to do so.\n\nThis time, it was the Democrat who kept interrupting and throwing out attack lines. Pence was able to express some of the major lines of Republican criticism against Clinton's policy record, something that Trump has mostly failed to do. He brought in the attacks on whether voters can trust Clinton without letting the issue overwhelm his argument.\n\nPence scored some points by responding to the claims about Trump's insults by pointing to Clinton's line about half of Trump's supporters being in the basket of \"deplorables\".\n\nKaine's aggressive demeanor, filled with endless interruptions and jabs, will not play well with some voters. Pence's statements about religion and abortion are sure to comfort some Republicans who are uneasy with their nominee.\n\nRepublicans were absolutely desperate to halt the stream of negative news stories coming out about the Trump campaign that has dominated the past week and, in this respect, Pence achieved his goal.\n\nThe challenge for the Republicans though is that Trump is still at the top of the ticket, with all the negatives he has brought to the party. With Trump live tweeting insulting comments throughout the debate, the real question is whether this has any impact at all on the polls.\n\nThere is little evidence that Trump will show any signs of remorse about his style or about his policies. Trump is also in the middle of preparing for a town hall debate on Sunday that will give Clinton a huge opportunity to use her seasoned campaign skills a second time around.\n\nIn the end, it might be that Pence's biggest accomplishment Tuesday night was to help him launch a possible presidential ticket of his own for 2020.\n\nRoxanne Jones: Pence is polished, but Is that enough?\n\nWhen you know it's wrong, just be quiet and move on. That was the strategy adopted by Governor Mike Pence at Tuesday night's vice presidential debate when it came to defending his Presidential running mate Donald Trump.\n\nRepeatedly, Pence declined to defend some of the more flammable issues surrounding Trump. On Trump's not paying taxes, insulting immigrants, Muslims, women, business deals with Vladimir Putin's Russia -- Pence was mostly silent. Clearly, Pence does not believe in everything Trump is selling. No matter how many times Senator Tim Kaine tried to bait Pence, he stood firm, opting to defend his own conservative legacy and reputation instead of getting mired in Trump's drama. Smart move.\n\nKaine, who it turns out, isn't just a mild-mannered nice guy, was a breath of fresh air. He came into the debate armed with information and talking points on Hillary, ready to pounce. And he seemed just the right amount of fed up. Maybe it's the fighter in me, but I liked his fire.\n\nTrue, Kaine acted at times like an over-eager kid trying to hard to impress us, but at least he wholeheartedly believes in what he and Hillary Clinton are trying to sell to the American public. He believes in her.\n\nUnlike Pence, Kaine doesn't not give the impression that the main reason he's on the ticket is to enhance his own political stature, or even worse, be a babysitter for a wayward president. Integrity matters. The win goes to Tim Kaine, by an edge.\n\nRoxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

And the launch pads themselves were designed to take winds at greater than 100 knots, or 115 miles per hour, so they should be able to withstand the storm.\n\nMost of the Space Center's preparations involved stowing away any equipment or other items that could become airborne in the high winds, and lowering antennas.\n\nDiller said the space center should be ready for Matthew's high-powered winds by the end of the day Wednesday. The storm is expected to make landfall in Florida on Friday morning, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen.\n\nThe deadly hurricane took 10 lives and left a trail of mass destruction as it moved through Haiti, the Dominican Republic and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. By Wednesday afternoon, Matthew was headed toward the Bahamas.\n\nRelated: Hurricane Matthew: Evacuations begin as deadly storm nears\n\nThe space center and visitor complex are expected to reopen Saturday at 9 am ET.\n\nThe next launch at Kennedy Space Center is slated for November 4.

Dees would not disclose the prices for an individual sale.\n\nThe Los Angeles condo is one of numerous properties owned by Depp and its listing comes less than two months after it was revealed that the actor is selling two other mansions he owns -- one in France and the other in Venice.\n\nDoors connect three of the five penthouses\n\nAlthough the sales would appear to be related to his recent divorce, Dees emphasized the LA sale was a savvy business decision by the actor, who reportedly first bought the apartments from the developer for a little over a combined $7.2 million.\n\n\"Real estate prices in Los Angeles are at very healthy levels,\" he says. \"Mr. Depp is not only a brilliant actor and artist but he's a smart businessman.\"",

    "text": "Within hours of Facebook launching Marketplace, the Craigslist-esque forum had already been overrun by users selling a mix of bizarre and illegal items.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, a can of beer was listed for $25. In London, someone was trying to \"sell\" his pregnant girlfriend for $400. And in New York, someone listed \"About 6 Oz. Water (Bottle Not Included)\" for $56.\n\nOn Tuesday, Facebook (FB, Tech30) blamed a \"technical issue\" for all the strange posts, but didn't elaborate on what the issue was other than to say it prevented the review system from screening posts that violated its Commerce Policies.\n\nFacebook's guidelines prohibit a dozen categories of products from being sold on its platform, including drugs, animals, \"adult items or services,\" alcohol and weapons. Although Marketplace is a new feature, people have always been able to buy and sell things on Facebook. Stopping things like private gun sales has been a problem before.\n\n\"We are working to fix the problem and will be closely monitoring our systems to ensure we are properly identifying and removing violations before giving more people access to Marketplace,\" Mary Ku, Facebook's Director of Product Management, said in a statement.\n\nFacebook has stopped the rollout of Marketplace while it works on a fix. The company said it's still working to remove all the strange items that appeared because of the issue. It said it also expects to find listings that violate its policies to \"periodically\" slip through, which will be dealt with on a case by case basis.\n\nRelated: Here's how Facebook's new Marketplace works\n\nMore than a billion people log into Facebook every day, making it difficult for the company to police everything that's posted.\n\nIn addition to automated reviews, Facebook says it gives people tools to report items they feel shouldn't be listed.\n\nFacebook is also working to improve its image recognition technology, which could help the site identify illegal products before they're uploaded to the platform.",

    "text": "Beijing (CNN) Wang Qiang is six years old and can solve a standard Rubik's Cube in less than 30 seconds.\n\nHe started cubing when he was in kindergarten and attended his first competition this weekend. Almost 1,000 Rubik's fanatics gathered to test and showcase their skills at The Asian Championship in Beijing.\n\nBut Wang wasn't the youngest competitor -- that honor went to a four-and-a-half year old.\n\nWang is part of a new generation of cubers in China -- and globally.\n\nThe six-sided puzzle, which was invented by Hungarian designer Erno Rubik in 1974 and was once the world's top selling toy, has enjoyed a huge comeback in recent years.\n\nThe World Cube Association (WCA) was founded in 2004 and holds dozens of competitions each month. Celebrities including Will Smith and Justin Bieber show off their cube-solving skills in YouTube videos.\n\nAnd in China, Rubik's Cube classes are thought to give young kids a competitive edge.\n\nWang Jianfeng, Wang's mother, says cubing is his favorite after-school activity. There are 200 training schools in Beijing alone.\n\n\"I think the cubing class is worth the money. He gets obsessed and the cube keeps him from the smart phone,\" she says.\n\n\"We want to find something for my son to play and learn at the same time. I think cubing is a great tool to tap into brainpower.\"\n\nExplosive growth\n\nCubers also compete blindfolded.\n\nChris Krueger, a delegate of World Cube Association, says that the Chinese cubing community has exploded in recent years.\n\nOnly 100 participants attended the first official WCA event in China, which he helped organize in 2007. The sport has also grown differently to the US, where he says there's also a huge number of players, but less opportunity for group training.\n\n\"The community is big in the US,\" he says. \"People watch YouTube videos and learn, get involved in the online community and they go to competitions. (But) there's nothing like taking a class.\"\n\nThis weekend's Asian Championship in Beijing was the biggest ever cubing competition in the world, organizers said.\n\nCompetitors took part in 18 different events, including solving different sized cubes. They also solved the puzzle one-handed, blind folded and using their toes.\n\nMany seek to emulate Sun Hongye, a professional cuber and winner of a popular reality TV show \"The Brain.\" He's used his fame to launch a nationwide business.\n\n\"We believe there is more potential for growth in the second, third or fourth-tier cities, since the cubes are cheap to get and people there tend to follow the trend,\" he says.\n\nOn the blurb of his recently published book, Sun lists seven perks of playing the cube. He says the game can help with confidence, boosting power and focus, improving hand-eye coordination, enhancing your memory, improving your grit and making friends.\n\nLittle Wang competed in four events at the tournament; the standard 3x3x3 cube, smaller 2x2x2 cube, the pyraminx -- a pyramid-shaped puzzle -- and the skewb, a skewed version of the cube.\n\nWhen CNN caught up with him, he was sat on a plastic stool next to 13 others from his cubing school.\n\nHe was lining up all six colors, on all six sides of his cube, with dizzying speed. He'd practiced so much his fingers were sore.\n\nBut it paid off -- he was the youngest to get through to the second round in the pyraminx event.\n\n\"I love cubing. I love cubing classes,\" he says.",

    "text": "(CNN) Hours on end confined to two feet square, teetering atop a box amid screams, shouts and sometimes violence. And you might not even walk away with anything usable. It's no life, working in the photographer's pit.\n\nYet when fashion week rolls into town, photographers volunteer to enter the pit in search of the perfect picture. Perched at the end of the runway there's nowhere to hide, and the difference between a front page splash and the virtual dustbin can be a matter of millimeters.\n\nThey're a special breed and one worth examining, so we sent our intrepid snapper into the throng to turn her camera on her colleagues -- and herself.\n\nJeff Moore\n\nJeff Moore (left, in pink) has been photographing London Fashion week for over 20 years.\n\nYears covering London Fashion Week: \"Probably since 1993 or 1994. Over 20 years, definitely.\"\n\nDo you have a favorite show you've covered?\n\n\"Anything [Alexander] McQueen did was just genius. I mean, I'm a blokey bloke from East London, but you go and see one of those shows... they were just amazing.\"\n\nHow has the job changed since you started?\n\n\"In the days of film you shot a show, you put it in a bag and a courier came and picked it up. Now you have more work because you have to process it all yourself. But at least it puts you back in control of your pictures... you can send your own selection now and give your own interpretation of things.\"\n\nWhat is the most shocking thing you've seen from the pit?\n\n\"The big one, the cardinal sin [of the pit], is taking someone else's spot. I once saw a fantastic fight in Milan. This is going back a long time ago, maybe the late '90s. Some French guy had nicked some Italian guy's spot. Everyone was on their boxes and they started to have a proper tear-up. One of them hit the other one and literally half the photographers went down like a house of cards.\"\n\nWhat is your pet peeve when it comes to guests?\n\n\"The fashion world is quite an odd one. I wouldn't say most of the people are self-centered, but they're very focused on what they're doing and don't tend to be aware of themselves. The big problem is with crossed legs. Spaces are very narrow a lot of the time, so quite often you only have a foot or sometimes less either side of where you're shooting, and if you have muck in it, it ruins it.\n\n\"We shout at them to uncross their legs. They normally do. Occasionally there's a more stubborn person.\"\n\nSuzanne Plunkett\n\nSuzanne Plunkett (center) takes a self portrait in a reflection at the end of the runway.\n\nYears covering LFW: \"Every season since September 2004. Previously I was based in New York, where I shot the city's fashion week from 1999-2002.\"\n\nBeyond cameras, what's your essential piece of kit?\n\n\"Duct tape and a marker pen are very important. They're what you need to stake out your small square of workspace. Without a good vantage point, your fancy camera equipment is useless.\"\n\nWhat's your worst moment from the pit?\n\n\"A few years ago in London I remember shooting the entire Anya Hindmarsh show while getting hit on the head by a camera lens purposely and repeatedly by another photographer who showed up late and decided to use me (and my head) to express his frustration at not having a tall enough ladder.\"\n\nAny funny stories from your time on the fashion circuit?\n\n\"About 15 years ago in New York I was working for the Associated Press. Roughly 60 photographers were invited to shoot the DKNY runway show, but there was only space for about 20.\n\n\"The media liaisons for Donna Karan were very unhelpful and acted as if they didn't want us there. A small group of us decided to walk out. As word spread that we had walked out, more and more photographers joined us, leaving only a couple of house photographers to shoot the high profile show. It felt very empowering. Needless to say the next season we were treated very differently and were served champagne and canap\u00e9s!\"\n\nHannah McKay\n\nThis is Hannah McKay's second London Fashion Week.\n\nYears covering LFW: \"This is my second season covering LFW. I'm here for the European Pressphoto Agency.\"\n\nAre there any quirks of the job that might surprise the public?\n\n\"The LFW photographers' wire room has an unlimited supply of popcorn!\"\n\nWhat's the most shocking moments you've witnessed?\n\n\"At the end of a Julien Macdonald show, Julien Macdonald appeared on the catwalk with the models, when a member of the audience stood up and walked into the middle of the catwalk to get a picture of them on her phone, completely blocking my view. Luckily they walked the entire length of the runway for us, in which the woman had no choice but to step back to her seat.\"\n\nWhat's been you best experience at a fashion week?\n\n\"The Charlotte Olympia show was the best to cover this year, it was energetic and colorful, which made a different editorial picture.\"\n\nIsabel Infantes\n\nIsabel Infantes claims her space among colleagues at her first fashion week.\n\nYears covering LFW: \"One.\"\n\nHow's it been?\n\n\"So far it has been a very enjoyable experience. People had told me it can be turn a bit monotonous after a couple of days and there is also the hassle of moving from one location to the other. Overall it has been very good. I only wish I had more time to explore the showroom upstairs and the photographers' room to get some free goodies. You can even book a free haircut!\"\n\nWhat might the public not know about the life of a fashion photographer?\n\n\"Maybe the work that we put into after the show is done. We work under pressure to file the best pictures in the quickest way.\"\n\nDid you have any bad experiences at fashion week?\n\n\"I've got to admit I lost my temper a bit at one of the shows, when I arrived and saw my spot had been half-taken by another photographer. I panicked a bit but in the end we made peace.\"\n\nDo you have an interest in fashion?\n\n\"I do not consider myself a fashionista. With work I quite often do not even find time to look in the mirror and I still like things I wore ages ago.\"\n\nKi Price\n\nKi Price, a regular photographer for Vivienne Westwood.\n\nYears covering LFW: \"Probably nine years now.\"\n\nDo you have any pet peeves as a photographer?\n\n\"I was shooting yesterday and someone next to me was shooting on their iPhone. That's a bit of a pet hate for our whole industry in general. It is happening more and more. Someone's got a blog and they've got 50 followers... I understand the need for that, but put them in the front row! Don't give them the photographers' and the video guys' room. A lot of them don't understand the rules of how to behave and how to play the game.\"\n\nHave you experienced any shocking things from the pit?\n\n\"I mean there's obviously petty quarrels that go on, [but] I don't really think I've witnessed that much bad stuff.\n\n\"A couple of years ago I was at a show in East London and one of the models drops her handkerchief. Vivienne Westwood walks over to the catwalk, picks it up and tries to give it to her on the way back. It took the model totally by surprise. That was quite a nice little moment.\"\n\nWhat are your rules of the pit?\n\n\"Watch out for the Italians! No, what would I say? Be mindful of the photographers who have been there for a long time. Be respectful and try and get down. Just make friends, basically. These are the people you're going to be working with year on, year out. Just try and conduct yourself in the best way possible.\"\n\nJonas Gustavsson\n\nJonas Gustavsson (R) waits for the start of the Mary Katrantzou catwalk show.\n\nYears covering LFW: \"I've shot 46 seasons not including Haute Couture.\"\n\nHow has the job changed since you started? \"More stress, less work and much less pay, but that is also businesswide in photography. Not being 25 anymore does not help on the knees and hips when we stand for hours on end.\"\n\nWhy do you do it? Do you still enjoy it? \"I got started with it very young and loved the challenge of the shoots, some of the travel, camaraderie and the fantastic venues and shows you get to see. I do love it most of the time, the schedule has become more grueling through the years with more shows and longer days. I easily clock 18 hour days or more for about 5 weeks.\"\n\nWhat's the most shocking moment you've witnessed? \"A model walk straight off the runway at Jean Paul Gaultier, she was completely blinded by the lights and suddenly just walked off a high catwalk, she was fine albeit a bit ruffled.\"",

Inside, I encounter more of the unexpected, including a few hobos.\n\n\"These are wines that don't get the recognition they deserve,\" Jesse Harnden, the official \"arch deacon\" at the Hatch explains with a crooked smile.\n\nFittingly, the labels for the varietals selected for their \"hobo series,\" from Cab Franc to Muscat to Semillon, are specially-designed by a local artist named Paul Morstad, depicting ironically-drawn, shabbily-dressed gents who would look perfectly at home in a Depression-era bread line.\n\nThe whimsy continues all around me -- labels with triceratops and flying pigs and a very strange-looking creature, playing a banjo.\n\n\"Every one of our wines has a story,\" says the arch deacon.\n\nI'm in the Okanagan Valley near the city of Kelowna, which sits at the center of one of Canada's fastest-growing wine regions.\n\nA scheduled stop Tuesday on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's late-September royal visit to British Columbia, Kelowna, a city of 117,000, and the surrounding area is less known than Sonoma or Napa or even Niagara, but this valley has changed dramatically in the last three decades.\n\nLovely terroir\n\nBisected by a warm, narrow, 84 mile-long lake that runs almost all the way to the US border, the Okanagan Valley is a place where calm waters are fringed by low mountains, and where wineries on the surrounding slopes have grown from just 17 in 1990 to more than 160 today.\n\nWith Okanagan Lake beaches and plenty to eat and drink, this region isn't just a destination for the royals -- rather, it's fast becoming a prime vacation spot for an ever-increasing number of Americans, here to taste the fruit of the soil and enjoy the other benefits of this lovely terroir.\n\nDuring my two weeks in the region, I drink my own weight in wine, touring a number of vineyards and learning along the way that the valley's unique climate creates excellent wine.\n\nSitting in a rain shadow, summers here are hot and dry, with days in June stretching from 5 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and daytime temperatures reaching well into the 90s. Those conditions are ideal for Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Riesling, Chardonnay and a number of other varietals.\n\nAt Mission Hill Family Estate in West Kelowna -- which Wills and Kate are scheduled to visit -- I enjoy a tasting down in the winery's barrel room, then sit down for a fresh lunch on their terrace. While I eat, I savor both the view and the food, which is sourced from local farmers and supplemented with produce grown right on site.\n\nFurther down the road, I visit the western outpost of Jackson-Triggs , a major national label, for a unique food-and-wine sampling experience, tasting fresh, locally sourced bites with their natural Okanagan wine pairings.\n\nAnd I even strap on my hiking boots and walk the soil at Quails' Gate , climbing through the vines in West Kelowna and tasting some of their Merlot -- served up from the back of a pickup truck -- while watching the late-afternoon light reflect on Lake Okanagan.\n\nMom-and-pop places\n\nI get my feet wet, too -- quite literally -- at the House of Rose Winery . While some wineries here (including Mission Hill and Quails' Gate) radiate sophistication, the charm of the Okanagan can be found in its many small, mom-and-pop places like House of Rose.\n\nThis is where I slip off my shoes and socks, climb a small set of steps and slide into the muck, placing my bare feet into about a foot of juice and skins and vines, the last remnants of a few thousand partially crushed and awfully runny grapes.\n\nThe red slush is surprisingly cold, and I grit my teeth as I give them a good stomp. The proto-vino slides through my toes, slimy and unpleasant, as I pull up the bottom fringes of my shorts and do my very best to keep the grape juice from splashing onto my limited supply of clothes.\n\nAfter a couple minutes, I've had enough; climbing back out of the barrel, I chat with Aura Rose, the current owner. Still family-run, House of Rose was opened by her father, Vern, a retired teacher, in 1993.\n\nThey cultivate just five acres on site, making three white wines, three dessert wines, a ros\u00e9 and three reds, including their bestseller, a full-bodied blend called Hot Flash.\n\nThe blend's name was born on an evening when Aura and a number of other women of a certain age were sipping wine and eating, admittedly a bit tipsy, and one friend underwent an actual hot flash.\n\n\"Women love it,\" she says with a wan smile. \"And it's great with cheese.\"\n\nLocal sourcing\n\nWith good wine you often find excellent food, and that's true in the Okanagan, too.\n\nOn a Saturday morning, I browse the local, twice-weekly Kelowna farmer's market, following the crowd from a mall parking lot to its adjacent location. I survey the organic offerings at its 165 stalls -- from apples and peaches to kale and green onion and lettuce -- chatting with some of the sellers about the unique, and usually excellent, growing conditions in this valley. The same sun and soil that produce those grapes, they say, also grow the bounty I see before me.\n\nFor a taste of the area's finest flavors, all in one place, I have dinner at Raudz, a Kelowna institution for the past fourteen years. Chef and co-owner Rod Butters made his name in high-end hotel kitchens, including a stint with Four Seasons. His stripped-down space in downtown Kelowna is fastidious about sourcing from the valley.\n\n\"We use 100 different small producers,\" he notes as he swings by my table.\n\nHe boasts that 92 percent of all their ingredients and 99 percent of their wines by the glass come from local sources. I dig in, sampling everything from a savory pork cheek confit to a delicate venison carpaccio.\n\nThe next day, I make the short trip from my lakeside hotel to tour a number of other spots in the walkable center of the city, all places that use Okanagan ingredients.\n\nAt Broken Ladder , I sip cider made with apples from local orchards. At Okanagan Spirits , I down some spruce-infused gin and cherry-infused liqueur, learning how even this distillery follows the seasons in its offerings. And at the Beer Institute, I chat with self-professed beer geeks, sampling their unfiltered, unpasteurized brews, some of which are made with hops they grow themselves, on-site.\n\nQuirky appeal\n\nAnd then, with a friend at the wheel, I ride just out of town, driving along the lake and up onto a promontory that overlooks it, to the Hatch, where I think I enjoy the stories as much as the wine I'm tasting (both are excellent).\n\nSo-called \"chief steward\" Andrew Melville tells me that their raison d'etre is to showcase the individual vineyards from which their wines are sourced.\n\nHe also explains about the funny job titles.\n\n\"We wanted to be unlike other wineries, so it seemed redundant to have titles like 'manager' or 'assistant night janitor,'\" he says. \"For what I do, chief steward sounded great, had a ring to it, was weird but also fitting in a strange way.\"\n\nHe adds that all the quirk I encounter is intentional.\n\n\"We created 'the Hatch,' pun intended, as our hatching ground for various forms of art, wine, vineyards, stories and so on,\" he says, adding that he feels that their logo basically says everything we need to know about what they do.\n\n\"We had a 'bird' and 'egg' concept going, and then we found Paul and that painting just tied it all together, much like Lebowski's rug,\" he said.\n\nSounds about right -- for this fresh, fun, slightly funky part of the left coast.",

The $2.5 billion NASA mission set out to explore Gale Crater, which was thought to have once hosted flowing water. Curiosity found evidence of clay formations, or \"mudstone,\" in the crater's Yellowknife Bay, scientists said in 2013. This clay may have held the key ingredients for life billions of years ago. It means a lake must have existed in the area.

Hide Caption 43 of 97\n\nPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here. The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team. The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water. The grains are too large to have been moved by wind. Hide Caption 44 of 97\n\nPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity This photo is an up-close look at an outcrop that also shows evidence of flowing water, according to the JPL/Caltech science team. The outcrop's characteristics are consistent with rock that was formed by the deposition of water and is composed of many smaller rounded rocks cemented together. Water transport is the only process capable of producing the rounded shape of conglomerate rock of this size.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) Recently, longtime Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit in New Jersey Superior Court against her former boss, Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, saying Ailes forced her out of the company after she refused, over a number of years, his sexual advances. The New York Times called the lawsuit an \"unprecedented public attack\" on Ailes, who is one of media's most powerful figures.\n\nIndeed, Carlson's move is gutsy. Any time a woman files a claim against a man of sexual misconduct, she must not only prove her allegations are true, but also defend her motives \u2014 and, too often, her character.\n\nAlready, Ailes has responded to the allegations by saying the retaliation was hers, and not his; that Carlson's contract was not renewed due to poor ratings and that she's acting out of revenge. If that's the case, she's certainly not going quietly.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the public nature of the suit \u2014 which included Carlson linking to a copy of the lawsuit on her personal website and launching a Twitter campaign, with the hashtag #StandWithGretchen \u2014 is unusual, given the fact that many such suits are settled privately.\n\nBut perhaps Carlson recognizes that's part of the problem \u2014 and part of the reason such incidents continue to occur, not just in the workplace but also on college campuses and in communities around the country.

    "text": "Washington (CNN) Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, in an interview published Wednesday, discussed the massive loss of human life in Syria and equated killings from the government of Bashar al-Assad and those caused by the United States.\n\nJohnson, pressed in his interview with The New York Times , on whether he viewed deaths caused deliberately by Assad's forces as the same as those caused by the United States, Johnson indicated he did.\n\n\"Well, no, of course not. We're so much better than all that,\" Johnson said with sarcasm, according to the report. \"We're so much better when in Afghanistan, we bomb the hospital and 60 people are killed in the hospital.\"\n\nJohnson was referring to a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders that the United States admitted it bombed in 2015. The Pentagon said after a military investigation that the action was not a war crime, although it did not allow an independent, international investigation into the killings.\n\nJohnson has made skepticism of foreign interventions a mainstay of his campaign, ensuring to highlight it in almost every interview he does. But he has had several embarrassing incidents that demonstrated his shortcomings in that area.\n\nAt the beginning of September, Johnson failed to recognize Aleppo, a city at the heart of the Syrian civil war. The embarrassing moment underscored Johnson's lack of foreign policy chops, and he compounded the mistake in a late September interview when he struggled to name a foreign leader he respected, conceding he was having another \"Aleppo moment.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Jake Tapper: This is Aleppo Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jake Tapper: This is Aleppo 02:47\n\nJohnson also specifically slammed Democrat Hillary Clinton, calling her a foreign policy hawk who contributed to bloodshed overseas.\n\n\"Because Hillary Clinton can dot the i's and cross the t's on geographic leaders, of the names of foreign leaders the underlying fact that hundreds of thousands of people have died in Syria goes by the wayside,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe Libertarian nominee's criticism of Clinton appears at odds with his running mate, Bill Weld, who told CNN Wednesday he would focus his criticism on Republican Donald Trump.\n\n\"I guess my role will be Hillary, and his role will be Donald Trump,\" Johnson said.",

Also, text highlights and a transcript of the discussion are below.\n\nMANDATORY CREDIT: CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\n\nContacts: Lauren Pratapas \u2014 Lauren.Pratapas@turner.com; 202.465.6666; Brooke Lorenz- Brooke.Lorenz@turner.com\n\nCNN STORY\n\nGiuliani: False claims about Clinton's marriage are 'fair game'\n\nGiuliani claims Trump 'a genius' for not paying taxes\n\nVIDEO HIGHLIGHTS\n\nRudy Giuliani full interview\n\nTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\n\nGiuliani on The New York Times report that Trump has not paid federal income taxes for 18 years: Well, all I have is \"The New York Times\" story to go by, so let me - let me comment on it as if it's true. First of all, what you failed to leave out of what you said - and it's not your fault - it's \"The New York Times\"' fault - is that this is perfectly legal. And \"The Times\" makes that point about 26 paragraphs into the opinion. Number two, \"The Times\" fails to point out that he has an obligation, as the head of a business, to take advantage of the tax advantages of and to use the lawful deductions and tax advantages that are available to you. I advise my clients to do that, because, if they don't do it, they get sued by their co-investors, by their investors, they lose jobs for their employees. And the reality is, this is rather common in large, gigantic American businesses, loss carry-forwards\u2026You might remember - you might remember, a few years ago, it was pointed out that GE paid no taxes\u2026So, the reality is, this is part of our tax code. The man is a genius. He knows how to operate the tax code for the benefit of the people he's serving.\n\nGiuliani on Americans paying income taxes: TAPPER: Well, that's interesting, because, Mr. Mayor, you say that he's a genius. Donald Trump said during the debate that not paying federal income taxes makes him smart. Does that mean that the rest of us who don't look for every possible loophole and provision to avoid paying our fair share of taxes, does that mean the rest of us are stupid? GIULIANI: No, absolutely not. In fact, 44 percent, 45 percent of America doesn't pay income tax. TAPPER: A lot of them are below the poverty line, not - they are not billionaires. They are below the poverty line, and they don't make enough to be taxed. GIULIANI: But someone told them that they - they - they don't have to pay taxes. And anybody that goes and has an accountant, H&R Block, or just goes online, figures out all the deductions available - available to them. I mean, the reality is that most Americans take advantage of every deduction available to them. And, of course. TAPPER: Most Americans pay federal income taxes, sir, and Donald Trump apparently did not. GIULIANI: No, just a little bit over most Americans pay federal income taxes. TAPPER: Yes, a majority of the American people pay federal income taxes. GIULIANI: And very - and very large businesses very often take advantage of these kinds of losses. Jake...\n\nGiuliani on if he pays federal income taxes: TAPPER: Do you pay federal income taxes? You're a successful businessman. Do you pay federal income taxes? GIULIANI: Well, that's between me and my accountant and the IRS. And the reality is, I pay my lawful tax, and he paid his lawful tax.\n\nGiuliani on Trump not releasing his tax return: TAPPER: He's the first - he's the first major party nominee since 1976 to not release his tax returns. If you're proud of that, that's great. But it - I don't think he should be. GIULIANI: And I am saying, the way all of you are treating this is a very good indication of why someone might not want to release their tax returns, because you take something that is perfectly legal, something he had no choice but to utilize - and if he didn't utilize it, he would have been in a lot of trouble - and you try to make it into - he did no wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has violated probably 30 federal statutes. He did nothing wrong. The headline should have been Donald Trump takes advantage of legal provisions in tax code. That's - that's the story. TAPPER: OK, that's an interesting - that's an interesting headline. I think most Americans are probably interested - most Americans pay their federal income taxes. Most Americans...GIULIANI: Well, I don't know. You don't know most Americans, and I don't know most Americans. TAPPER: I know that most Americans pay their federal income taxes, sir. Let me ask you something. In 2012... GIULIANI: I also know - I also know that most Americans take advantage of every deduction and every legal opportunity there is to save some taxes, so they don't have to pay as much as they are paying to the government\u2026And I know most Americans would - I know most Americans would rather be paying lower taxes than a Donald Trump and 10 percent or 20 percent more under Hillary Clinton.\n\nGiuliani on the Trump campaign spreading allegations that Hillary hasn\u2019t been loyal to Bill: TAPPER: Mr. Mayor, is that normal, stable behavior for a presidential nominee to launch an unsubstantiated attack? GIULIANI: Well, after - after she called him a racist and misogynist, a xenophobic, I don't know, schizophrenic, and I don't know what else she called him at the end of that debate, I think it's fair - it's fair game. TAPPER: Just to make stuff up, just to say wild accusations, Hillary Clinton is cheating on Bill, no proof of it whatsoever? Everything is fair game? GIULIANI: What - what - that was a sarcastic remark pointing out that Bill Clinton has, you know, quite a past, and Hillary Clinton has done quite a job on attacking the people who were victims of Bill Clinton. And not only that. She poses as a feminist, and she's taken money from countries that stone women, kill women, have women...TAPPER: Bill Clinton is not the nominee, sir. Bill Clinton is not the nominee. And this is my last question for you. GIULIANI: And he is...TAPPER: Is the Trump campaign - is Donald Trump and the people around Donald Trump really the ones to be casting aspersions on the marriages of anyone else? GIULIANI: It isn't a marriage. It isn't the marriage. It's the way she goes on the attack and tries to hurt victims of sexual predations. I mean, she's the one who says that victims should be taken seriously. TAPPER: That wasn't about her marriage? Him saying that she's not loyal to Bill isn't about her marriage? GIULIANI: I am saying the problem with Hillary Clinton has nothing to do, as far as I'm concerned, with her marriage. It's her protection of Bill Clinton for 20 or 25 years against allegations of rape, taking advantage of an intern, and going on the attack and trying to make those women appear to be insane in some cases. Also, it's her posing as a feminist and taking millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars, from countries that kill women, stone women, don't allow women to drive, don't allow women to have rights, use women as property. TAPPER: I just - I just - I - I mean, I just find it hard to believe that Mr. Trump would want to start leveling accusations about people's marriages. But that's all the time we have, Mr. Mayor. GIULIANI: I think the - I think the accusations are about Hillary Clinton taking money from countries that kill women. TAPPER: The accusation was that Hillary Clinton was cheating on Bill. That's what the accusation was. GIULIANI: That's\u2026TAPPER: It was an unhinged and wild accusation. I can understand why you can't defend it, because it's indefensible. Mayor Giuliani, thank you so much. I appreciate it. GIULIANI: Well, that's your opinion. And thank you for allowing me to reply to that.\n\nFULL TRANSCRIPT\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Jake Tapper.\n\nQuote: \"She's nasty, but I can be nastier than she ever can be.\"\n\nThat's what Donald Trump told \"The New York Times\" this weekend. And then he proved it at a rally last night.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She can't make it 15 feet to her car.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Give me a break.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Give me a break.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: While he was working that crowd, \"The New York Times\" published a story revealing that the paper had seen pages from Donald Trump's 1995 tax returns, which suggested a near-billion-dollar loss, a deduction so huge, it could have allowed Trump to not pay any federal income taxes for as long as 18 years.\n\nWe have lots to talk about with top Trump adviser and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who joins me now live from New York.\n\nMr. Mayor, thanks for being here.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: No, thank you very much, Jake. Nice to be with you.\n\nTAPPER: So, Mr. Mayor I have got to start with this bombshell report in \"The New York Times\" that Donald Trump may have avoided federal income taxes for almost a generation.\n\nIs your campaign disputing the authenticity of these documents from Donald Trump's 1995 tax returns that was mailed by an anonymous source?\n\nGIULIANI: Well, all I have is \"The New York Times\" story to go by, so let me - let me comment on it as if it's true.\n\nFirst of all, what you failed to leave out of what you said - and it's not your fault - it's \"The New York Times\"' fault - is that this is perfectly legal. And \"The Times\" makes that point about 26 paragraphs into the opinion.\n\nNumber two, \"The Times\" fails to point out that he has an obligation, as the head of a business, to take advantage of the tax advantages of and to use the lawful deductions and tax advantages that are available to you.

He knows how to operate the tax code for the benefit of the people he's serving.\n\nTAPPER: Well, that's interesting, because, Mr. Mayor, you say that he's a genius.\n\nDonald Trump said during the debate that not paying federal income taxes makes him smart. Does that mean that the rest of us who don't look for every possible loophole and provision to avoid paying our fair share of taxes, does that mean the rest of us are stupid?\n\nGIULIANI: No, absolutely not.\n\nIn fact, 44 percent, 45 percent of America doesn't pay income tax.\n\nTAPPER: A lot of them are below the poverty line, not - they are not billionaires. They are below the poverty line, and they don't make enough to be taxed.\n\nGIULIANI: But someone told them that they - they - they don't have to pay taxes.\n\nAnd anybody that goes and has an accountant, H&R Block, or just goes online, figures out all the deductions available - available to them.

Jake...\n\nTAPPER: Do you pay federal income taxes? You're a successful businessman. Do you pay federal income taxes?\n\nGIULIANI: Well, that's between me and my accountant and the IRS. And the reality is, I pay my lawful tax, and he paid his lawful tax.\n\nTAPPER: Well, let me ask you another question, sir.\n\nDonald Trump has...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGIULIANI: And, Jake - no, no, no, Jake, wait a second. This is really very unfair.\n\nIf he didn't take advantage of those tax deductions or tax advantages that he had, he could be sued, because he - his obligation, as a businessman, is to make money for his enterprise and to save money for his enterprise. It would have been insane for him to take advantage of them.\n\nTAPPER: Sued by whom? Who would sue him for his own personal income taxes?\n\nGIULIANI: Investors in his business, people who loan money to his business, banks that loan money to his business.\n\nIf I have a $200 million loss carry-forward that I can use, and I don't lose - and I don't use - use it, and I end up costing my company $200 million more, don't you think a bank that I borrowed money from is going sue me for mismanaging my business.\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Mayor, let me ask you another question.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Donald Trump, his pitch is...\n\nGIULIANI: That's why you are - that's why the simplistic analysis of an extraordinary, complex code is so unfair. The reality...\n\nTAPPER: I think that there are a lot of very, very successful business men and women who pay federal income taxes and don't look for every single opportunity there is to avoid paying them.\n\nBut let me ask you another question. Donald Trump has been selling himself as a brilliant businessman.\n\nGIULIANI: Wait a second, Jake. Wait a second. No, no.\n\nTAPPER: He has been selling himself as a brilliant businessman.\n\nGIULIANI: No, wait a second.\n\nTAPPER: He lost almost a billion dollars in 1995.\n\nGIULIANI: You got to let me - you got to - you got to - there are not very many smart businessmen who don't take advantage of the tax - legal tax laws that are there.\n\nAnd if they are, then they are not very good businessmen, and no one wants to go into business with them. They don't have very good lawyers and they don't have very good accountants.\n\nTAPPER: OK.\n\nBut, let me ask you, sir, he's selling himself as a brilliant businessman. He lost almost a billion dollars in 1995.\n\nGIULIANI: Correct.\n\nTAPPER: That doesn't sound particularly brilliant to me.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, yes it does.\n\nTAPPER: It does?\n\nGIULIANI: Since he came back. Since he came back. And he came all the way back.\n\nAnd isn't that the history of America? I mean, people like Steve Jobs were fired - was fired by Apple and came all the way - and came all the way back. Churchill was thrown out of office twice and came all the way back.\n\nIt shows what a genius he is. It shows he was able to preserve his enterprise and then he was able to build it. And the idea that he could carry it forward for 18 years means that at no time in 18 years did he make $916 million.\n\nAnd, of course, we know, last year, he made $685 million. We know that from his financial disclosure form.\n\nTAPPER: But he hasn't released his tax returns. The only reason we know anything about this is because somebody released this to \"The New York\" - somebody leaked this to \"The New York Times.\"\n\nGIULIANI: No.\n\nWe know - we know that he made $680 million last year from his 104-page financial disclosure form...\n\nTAPPER: All right, Mr. Mayor...\n\nGIULIANI: ... which - which describes considerably more about his finances than the tax return. And the reason...\n\nTAPPER: He's the first - he's the first major party nominee since 1976 to not release his tax returns. If you're proud of that, that's great. But it - I don't think he should be.\n\nGIULIANI: And I am saying, the way all of you are treating this is a very good indication of why someone might not want to release their tax returns, because you take something that is perfectly legal, something he had no choice but to utilize - and if he didn't utilize it, he would have been in a lot of trouble - and you try to make it into - he did no wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary Clinton has violated probably 30 federal statutes. He did nothing wrong. The headline should have been Donald Trump takes advantage of legal provisions in tax code. That's - that's the story.\n\nTAPPER: OK, that's an interesting - that's an interesting headline. I think most Americans are probably interested - most Americans pay their federal income taxes. Most Americans...\n\nGIULIANI: Well, I don't know. You don't know most Americans, and I don't know most Americans.\n\nTAPPER: I know that most Americans pay their federal income taxes, sir.\n\nLet me ask you something. In 2012...\n\nGIULIANI: I also know - I also know that most Americans take advantage of every deduction and every legal opportunity there is to save some taxes, so they don't have to pay as much as they are paying to the government.\n\nTAPPER: In 2012...\n\nGIULIANI: And I know most Americans would - I know most Americans would rather be paying lower taxes than a Donald Trump and 10 percent or 20 percent more under Hillary Clinton.\n\nTAPPER: OK.\n\nMr. Mayor, in 2012, Donald Trump tweeted: \"Half of Americans don't pay income tax, despite crippling government debt.\"\n\nHe is in that half that does not pay federal income taxes, despite crippling government debt. When he rails against the junky infrastructure, when he rails against La Guardia Airport, when he talks about how bridges are collapsing, is he not responsible, at least in part, for the fact that these things are not being repaired?\n\nGIULIANI: No. No.\n\nTAPPER: He's not at all?\n\nGIULIANI: Absolutely not.\n\nTAPPER: Not at all? No?\n\nGIULIANI: The law is responsible for it.\n\nIf you have a sensitivity laws, you live by those laws. And the reality is, you are ignoring completely the fiduciary obligation that he has to all the people around him to run his business at the lowest possible expense.\n\nEvery businessman takes advantage of it, including Warren - Warren Buffett. And Warren Buffett think we should be paying 90 percent in taxes. So, why doesn't he voluntarily send in that extra 40 percent? Let him voluntarily make out a check and send it in if that's what - he does exactly the same thing. He takes advantage of the law.\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Mayor, I have one last question for you.\n\nDonald Trump launched a wild and unsubstantiated attack against Hillary Clinton last night. Take listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, you want to know the truth.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: And, really, folks, really, why should she be, right?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Mayor, is that normal, stable behavior for a presidential nominee to launch an unsubstantiated attack?\n\nGIULIANI: Well, after - after she called him a racist and misogynist, a xenophobic, I don't know, schizophrenic, and I don't know what else she called him at the end of that debate, I think it's fair - it's fair game.\n\nTAPPER: Just to make stuff up, just to say wild accusations, Hillary Clinton is cheating on Bill, no proof of it whatsoever?

Bill Clinton is not the nominee.\n\nAnd this is my last question for you.\n\nGIULIANI: And he is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Is the Trump campaign - is Donald Trump and the people around Donald Trump really the ones to be casting aspersions on the marriages of anyone else?\n\nGIULIANI: It isn't a marriage.

    "text": "Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) The calamity that has befallen the people of Syria has put the entire world to shame. The image of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi lying facedown on a beach, dead, after his family sought to escape the horrors of their country's civil war , has touched the world. But compassion without action is pointless.\n\nThousands of refugees are battling European governments. Today, it's Hungary . Last month, it was Macedonia . Desperate people are paying thousands of dollars to traffickers to take them to safety; scores have died of asphyxia after being locked in trucks that failed to reach their destination; thousands have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWe are living in the worst refugee crisis since World War II , and yet the truth is that world leaders have failed to manage the crisis. They will, of course, answer to history. But in the meantime, the situation will only become worse without drastic action: More will die, more refugees will arrive unwanted, more countries will become destabilized and, if this goes on much longer, we will have a generation of Syrians who have grown up in the kind of conditions that perpetuate conflict.\n\nIt is too late to prevent the current crisis, but there is plenty we can try to do moving forward to try to ease it.\n\nWhat exactly?\n\nFor a start, world leaders should convene a top-level emergency gathering to focus on the key aspects of this crisis. The conference should be called by a group of countries, including Germany with strong backing from the United States, and should include the European Union, the United Nations and other world powers, Syria's neighbors, and also Russia and China. The objective should be threefold: to stop the killing, to help the refugees and to bring an end to the war.\n\nArab nations must play a major role in addressing the Syrian crisis. We are all responsible. But the people of Syria are their neighbors, their brethren. The conflict is in their midst, its impact close to home. To be sure, the neighborhood has not completely failed Syrian refugees. The overwhelming majority of those who have fled Syria -- millions of them -- are now living in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and Arab states have helped finance those costs. But more is needed.\n\nOnce convened, this international conference should work to develop a comprehensive international plan to help refugees, one that involves a much greater role for Arab and other Muslim states. Indeed, wealthy Gulf states should be encouraged to not just make an outsize financial contribution, but countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia should be pressed to welcome refugees.\n\nOf course, Europe and the United States should also receive more from among the millions of desperate Syrian refugees fleeing conflict. But so should thriving Muslim states such as Malaysia, Indonesia and of course Iran, whose support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad means it has additional moral responsibility for what is happening. (And speaking of Asia, this could be an opportunity for a country like Japan, with its demographic crisis, to boost its population, or at least do its part to share the burden of this major humanitarian emergency.)\n\nBut giving refuge to those who are fleeing the horrors of conflict is not enough -- the crisis also needs to be tackled at its source. So, to at least try to slow the killing, it is time to give serious consideration to the establishment of safe zones inside Syria, a proposal that is actually more complicated than it might sound.\n\nFor example, when Turkey proposed such an approach , some feared that it secretly planned to expel Syrian refugees from Turkish territory and send them back inside Syria to any safe zones. If the system is to work, these zones must come with an ironclad vow from countries hosting refugees not to force anyone to return to Syria before the war is over.\n\nSafe zones will, of course, require a military commitment to be effective, perhaps from the United States, NATO and other allies, to guarantee the \"safe\" in \"safe zones.\" They will therefore need to become no-fly zones, with air patrols and anti-aircraft support on the ground. The betrayal of so-called safe areas in Bosnia's Srebrenica must never be allowed to happen again.\n\nAbove all, though, it is imperative to bring an end to the war, to defeat ISIS and -- just as crucially, although this point now often gets overlooked -- to bring an end to the regime of al-Assad, whose rejection of peaceful demands for democratic reform laid the groundwork for this epic human displacement and for the upsurge in extremism.\n\nAnd epic this displacement has truly been -- more than 320,000 people have been killed in the war, according to one monitoring group , and there is no end in sight. Before the war started in 2011, about 23 million people lived in Syria. Fully half of them have been displaced. Some 7.5 million are internally displaced . More than 4 million are registered with the United Nations, and many of those fleeing have not been. It is estimated that there are almost 2 million Syrian refugees in Turkey , at least 600,000 in Jordan and perhaps 1.1 million in Lebanon, where they now make up nearly a quarter of the total population.\n\nSuch an enormous movement of people is further destabilizing an already unsettled region, and bringing with it a level of disruption that could very well sow the seeds for another generation of conflict and extremism.\n\nThe West's initial approach, which effectively viewed the Syrian civil war as \"their problem,\" has merely underscored how in reality there is no way to contain such conflicts within national boundaries -- this war has spawned ISIS, its videotaped beheadings and sanctioned sexual slavery , scattering its poisonous extremist ideology far and wide. And while an international gathering cannot undo the devastation that has been wrought, it can still be a positive first step toward winding down this conflict.\n\nThis is the moral and strategic challenge of our time. So far, the world has failed. But if its leaders can begin to publicly and materially empower those who stand for a pluralistic, tolerant and democratic Syria -- one that will eventually welcome back the millions of citizens who have fled -- then we might be able to turn the compassion we have seen in recent days into a more hopeful legacy for the country and its people.",

    "text": "No wonder they are frustrated.\n\nWorking class white men saw their income drop 9% between 1996 and 2014, according to a new report from Sentier Research. This group, who Sentier defines as having only a high school diploma, earned only $36,787, on average, in 2014, down from $40,362 in 1996.\n\nMeanwhile, college educated white men saw their income soar nearly 23% over the same period, from $77,209 to $94,601.\n\nPublished by two former Census Bureau officials, the Sentier report shines yet another light on the fortunes of the white working class. This group has become a force in the 2016 presidential election, serving as the backbone of Donald Trump's support. And the Republican candidate's campaign has tailored much of his campaign to the working class, with promises that he will bring back the manufacturing jobs that once allowed them to support their families.\n\nRelated: White, working class & worried\n\nThe study first looked at the 1996 incomes earned by 10 groups of men in two-year cohorts ranging in age from 25 to 26 to 43 to 44. Sentier then looked at what men earned 18 years later, when the youngest cohort were 43 to 44 and the oldest were 61 to 62.\n\nThe results varied greatly by age. The youngest group of working class white men, who were 25 to 26 in 1996, saw their incomes rise by 19%, from $32,677 to $38,803, over the 18-year period. However, their college educated peers enjoyed a 133% explosion in their incomes, from $40,487 to $94,252.\n\nRelated: Working class whites blame Washington, but still want more government help\n\nWhen it came to the oldest cohort, who were 43 to 44 in 1996, both working class and college educated white men saw their incomes fall over the period. But the working class still fared worse, suffering a 47% drop in income, from $51,491 to $27,230. Men with college diplomas, however, saw their incomes fall 28.5%, from $95,734 to $68,406.\n\nThis decline among older workers stems in part from people who left the labor force or shifted to part-time work, which pulls down the average income for the group, said Gordon Green, co-author of the report.\n\nRelated: The economy stinks, but I'm doing OK, say working class whites\n\nIn order to capture these trends, Sentier calculated its income estimates by dividing the total amount of wage and salary income received by members of all of the age cohorts by the overall number of people in the group. This differs from the more common calculation, which just looks at those who receive wage and salary income and work full-time, year-round.\n\nThe income declines among working class white men stretches back to at least 1978, Sentier found. Those who were age 25 to 44 back then made more than they did in 1996. College educated white men, on the other hand, saw their income grow during that period.\n\nRelated: The men America has left behind\n\nIn addition to showing the tough times the working class has faced, the report also shows the big income boost that comes with a college degree, Green said.\n\n\"People say it may not be worth it to go to college. These numbers show that isn't true,\" he said.",

It\u2019s a hugely important river, but one that\u2019s been engineered almost to death.\n\nThanks to the Clean Water Act, rivers don't catch fire from industrial pollution like they used to. Here\u2019s what Ohio\u2019s Cuyahoga River looked like in 1952.\n\nAP Photo\n\nNow we\u2019re in the era of dead rivers -- a time when they\u2019ve been so dammed, diverted and overused that many of them simply cease to flow.\n\nLast year, CNN readers voted for me to do a story on the \u201cmost endangered\u201d river in the country as part of my Change the List project. Many rivers could vie for that title. Earlier this year, the Colorado River flowed to the sea for the first time in decades -- and that took an international agreement. The Rio Grande, which forms the U.S.-Mexico border, often doesn\u2019t make it to the ocean, either. And the Mighty Mississippi is so polluted by farms that it feeds a Connecticut-sized \u201cdead zone\u201d in the Gulf. The advocacy group American Rivers, however, chose the San Joaquin as the \u201cmost endangered\u201d river in 2014 because it\u2019s at a turning point. Depending on what happens soon, it could become a river reborn, or a drainage ditch.\n\nI had a personal reason for wanting to kayak the river, too.\n\n\u201cMost people are on the world, not in it,\u201d wrote John Muir, the famous naturalist who traveled the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada and whose journals I would carry with me down the San Joaquin.\n\nI think this notion of being disconnected from the natural world is especially pronounced when it comes to rivers.\n\nWe see them when we zip by on highways, maybe. Or when we fly over them. But we don\u2019t spend time with them -- don\u2019t know where they start or where they go. We sure don\u2019t Huck-Finn them these days.\n\nI\u2019m as guilty of this modern river blindness as anyone.\n\nBut I wanted to change. I wanted to get \u201cin\u201d this river.\n\nI just didn\u2019t realize quite what that would mean.\n\nI\u2019d been told I was the first person to try to kayak-walk it from source to sea. I\u2019m not exactly a candidate for that kind of river-blazing adventure: I\u2019m sorta-medium athletic and thankfully can swim, but it was my first time to try to kayak on a river, and I had pretty much no idea what I was doing. When I rented a kayak in Oakland a polite, granite-shouldered woman asked me about my \u201ckayaking regimen.\u201d\n\nUm \u2026 regimen?\n\nMy shoulders are less granite, more Play-Doh.\n\nStuck in the quicksand out in the middle of the Central Valley, still about 150 miles from the Pacific Ocean, it wasn\u2019t hard to see why no one travels the San Joaquin.\n\nIt\u2019s not your mother\u2019s river.\n\nAnd certainly not one I expected to love.\n\nMile 0 Where the dead river is born\n\nDarin McQuoid -- a professional kayaker who talks in surfer-speak; throws himself, willingly, off 80-foot waterfalls (tip: go nose first); and carries a polka-dot, Hello Kitty wallet, you know, just to be incongruous -- joined me on a hike to the mountain headwaters of the San Joaquin, high in the Sierra Nevada, the shark-tooth range along California\u2019s eastern border.\n\nOur destination was about 9 miles up, to elevation 9,833 feet.\n\nWe took the \u201cRiver Trail,\u201d and set off around 3:30 p.m.\n\nDarin is one of the only people brave enough to kayak the upper San Joaquin River. View this photo on Instagram\n\nWhitewater kayakers know rivers better than perhaps anyone, and Darin is one of the only people alive who has seen some of the upper sections of the endangered river -- a part that, to my surprise, remains remarkably wild and deadly.\n\nHe spends so much time with water that he\u2019s learned to trust its familiar melodies and rhythms. That\u2019s one reason he\u2019s able to careen through uncharted waters with a reasonable expectation of survival: He sees things in the river others can\u2019t.\n\nTake \u201cThe Crucible\u201d as an example. That\u2019s the nickname for a particularly hairy stretch of the upper San Joaquin, where the river splits into three strands -- one of which, at any moment, will dump you on a pile of rocks and kill you.\n\nWhich path? That changes all the time, and the cliffs along the river are so steep that it\u2019s impossible to scout the location and pick a route in advance.\n\nClearly these are not waters for a first-time river kayaker, or even for most experts. And in case I haven\u2019t made this abundantly clear: I am definitely no expert.\n\nSo, I wouldn\u2019t be able to float the very top section of river. I could only hike to the headwaters. Kayaking (and more walking) would come later.\n\nTrue to its name, the River Trail follows the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin (there are three branches of it up here) through a fir-covered valley at the bottom of stunning granite peaks. For miles, though, I didn\u2019t see the river. I noted the Oompa-Loompa-colored tree trunks, roots the size of thighs.\n\nThen I heard a distant rumble.\n\nThe river. Out of sight, down in the valley.\n\n\u201cSounds like a highway,\u201d I said.\n\nDarin\u2019s reply was casual but profound.\n\n\u201cHighways sound like rivers.\u201d\n\nIt was my first glimpse at what a river-first mindset can do for a person. Darin\u2019s life is tuned to the water in a way that\u2019s foreign but alluring to me. If you ask him where something is, he answers by the watershed rather than by the road or county. Like: Oh, that\u2019s on the Rogue. Or: Near the Kaweah. Or: Upriver of that. He\u2019s fully fluent in \u201ccfs\u201d -- cubic feet per second -- which is how whitewater kayakers and scientists measure the flow of a river, its speed and strength.\n\nAfter his comment, I started listening harder: I heard the rattle of timpani drums as the river dove into canyons, the gentle high-hats as it wandered through meadows.\n\nAbout 7:30 p.m., with stars starting to poke through the sky, we scrambled up a rocky path to the verdant shore of the headwaters.\n\nThis is the scene that emerged:\n\nThis is Thousand Island Lake.

Sutter (@jdsutter) June 13, 2014\n\nThousand Island Lake.\n\nDefinitely not named for the salad dressing.\n\nThis is the kind of landscape that screams with the force of a thousand gospel choirs. The lake is gemstone blue -- and pocked with tiny, moss-covered islands, each a Seurat painting of red and orange and green, set on a charcoal backdrop.\n\nThe cool air smelled of fir and was as thin as Prince William\u2019s hairline.\n\nIt just didn\u2019t seem real.\n\nI walked up to the shore to make sure -- dipped my hand in the frigid water. It was that numbing sort of cold that makes your arm feel like a phantom limb. I thought about jumping in the lake -- baptizing myself in the water that would carry me toward San Francisco. But as soon as I pulled my hand out, it started to throb in the cold.\n\nI looked up to the mountains, saw the snow on Banner Peak, and realized my dip would have to wait.\n\nI felt such conflicting emotions in the moment.\n\nGratitude that I was able to witness this pure and delightful scene -- a river intact, one of Muir\u2019s \u201cglorious landscapes now smiling in the sun.\u201d\n\nBut I also was offended for the water. I had some sense of what would happen to it in the scorching valley below.\n\nDarin and I set up camp within earshot of the lake.\n\nThat's @DarinMcQuoid at our camp last night. He's one of the few who has kayaked the upper rapids of #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/8S1LWwO5r2 \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 13, 2014\n\nAnd just before dark, another hiker joined us.\n\nPeter Vorster is a spritely hydro-geographer (\u201cI invented that term!\u201d he told me, beaming) from the Bay Institute, a group that studies this watershed \u201cfrom the Sierras to the sea.\u201d I\u2019d asked him to join us on the mountain. He arrived a shaken-up soda can of a person -- just literally bursting with stories.\n\nIt was easy to see how much he loves this river; his enthusiasm was infectious.\n\nAs we flipped on our headlamps and started cooking dinner, stars lighting up the sky, Peter talked about his previous experiences hiking in this part of the Sierra. Once, when he was a teenager, he didn\u2019t bring a tent because he wanted to sleep under the night sky. It started raining, and he shivered through the night -- going through all the stages of hypothermia, wondering if he\u2019d live.\n\nMost people would take that as a lesson never to trust nature again, or never to camp without a tent, at least. Not Peter. He didn\u2019t bring a tent this time, either.\n\nHe couldn't bear to have a piece of nylon between him and the stars and the river.\n\nHis love for this place is that psychotically strong.\n\nPeter has devoted his life to studying this watershed -- has been doing that essentially since he graduated from Berkeley in the hippie years. He helped me see this journey in a new way that was both exciting and frightening.\n\nI especially loved one analogy he used.\n\nThe best way to understand this river, Peter said, is to piss on it.\n\nPee all you want, and your urine won\u2019t reach the ocean.\n\nLove how Peter explains watersheds: pee over there, it goes to LA. Pee behind us - fertilize the Central Valley. pic.twitter.com/DHUb8By14p \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 13, 2014\n\nInstead, it\u2019ll get \u201cdiverted\u201d and \u201cwheeled,\u201d in the parlance of water nerds out here, through California\u2019s massive plumbing system. State and federal governments built a dizzying network of dams, pumps, canals and aqueducts in the wake of the Great Depression. The goals were logical enough -- create jobs and make the Western desert \u201cbloom\u201d with farms -- but the costs were extraordinary.\n\nEighty-percent of the water that\u2019s used in California goes to farms, and some of it travels 600 miles to get there. Nearly a fifth of California\u2019s energy use goes toward moving water around, including the power needed to lift it 2,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains, toward Los Angeles.\n\nIn the San Joaquin Valley, some 95% of wetlands have been lost. And since the state allocates eight times the amount of water that typically flows through the system, the river runs completely dry in its midsection all the time.\n\nI think Peter was a little disappointed I didn\u2019t immediately test his watershed-as-piss-conduit theory -- but I definitely got the point.\n\nMy urine, and my boat, would likely dead-end into a farm.\n\nThey\u2019d hit a 40-mile stretch of river that\u2019s always dry, by design.\n\nAs temperatures plunged and the sun vanished, the rail-thin, 60-year-old scientist told me about California\u2019s \u201cpleasure boating\u201d rule, which says, essentially, that a river is part of the public trust if it can be boated. There\u2019s a similar rule on the federal level -- with the Supreme Court ruling that rivers are protected under the Clean Water Act if they can be shown to be \u201cnavigable.\u201d There\u2019s a fascinating history of people using these rules to try to argue broken rivers should be made whole again. In 2008, for example, boater George Wolfe traveled the Los Angeles River -- which is basically a drainage ditch -- out to the sea to prove it\u2019s still a vital waterway.\n\nHelicopters chased him down.\n\n\u201cGET OUT OF THE RIVER NOW.\u201d\n\nBut he made it to the Pacific.\n\nHis journey \u201copened up access to a long-neglected waterway,\u201d according to a description on his website. And, in 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared the Los Angeles River a navigable river.\n\nThe San Joaquin has federal protection. But, talking to Peter, I realized my journey could be seen as a symbolic plea to make the river whole.\n\nA live-tweeted protest.\n\nIf only I actually knew how to kayak.\n\nMile 101 Damn the damn dams\n\n\u201cHow deep our sleep last night in the mountain\u2019s heart, beneath the trees and stars, hushed by solemn-sounding waterfalls and many small soothing voices in sweet accord whispering peace!\u201d -- John Muir, from \u201cMy First Summer in the Sierra\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Peter, Darin and I hiked down the mountain, across a snowfield, past glacial lakes and, at one point, through the river, the water rushing around my calves, stealing my footing and nearly yanking me in.\n\nThis is just below what would be a class 5 rapid. View this video on Instagram\n\nIt was brilliant.\n\nI\u2019d started to love this river -- its wild, free spirit.\n\nBut the mountain high wouldn't last long.\n\nSoon, I was back on the Central Valley floor.\n\nForecast: sauna.\n\nI'm usually not so obsessed with temperatures ...but holy hell.

The dam was completed in 1942, designed, in part, to hold back water for farms.\n\nExperts told me I\u2019d have to start below it.\n\nFriant dam, the nerve center of the #endangeredriver.

I imagined my urine trying to figure out which path goes to the ocean.\n\nIt\u2019s not so simple here.\n\nNationally, there has been a concerted push to remove dams like those that block the San Joaquin. These concrete cathedrals, as they\u2019ve been called, hold back tons of sediment, starving the wetlands and deltas. Land is disappearing from the Mississippi Delta, for example, at a rate of one football field per hour because that river has been so dammed and constrained. The dams also kill fish. The San Joaquin used to be home to the southernmost Chinook salmon run in the world, with an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 spring-run salmon, according to Gerald Hatler, from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. But the migration route has been destroyed; thousands of fish are being released into the river, but they can\u2019t survive here now unless they\u2019re put in trucks and driven around a dry stretch of the San Joaquin -- and its multitude of dams.\n\nThat sounds like a joke. But fish actually are hitchhiking on trucks.\n\nElsewhere, activists have painted dams with the famous John Muir quote -- \u201cFree the rivers!\u201d -- in hopes they\u2019ll be taken down.\n\nDavid J. Cross/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images\n\nMore than 1,000 U.S. dams have been removed in recent decades. But here, new dams are being proposed -- one just upstream of Friant, called Temperance Flat. I took a boat out to the proposed site with representatives from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which argues the new dam would \u201ccreate\u201d water that could be used to help fish and farmers (they wouldn\u2019t say in what proportions).\n\nMy stomach sank as I saw a beautiful canyon that could be drowned.\n\nSo eerie. All of this would flood to the hilltops if a proposed dam were built. #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/VTOycBXEXx \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 13, 2014\n\nA bureau manager told me nothing would be lost. Only \u201creplaced.\u201d\n\nBut dams kill rivers -- and there are some 75,000 dams in the United States today.\n\n\u201cThink about that number,\u201d former U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in a 1998 speech. \u201cThat means we have been building, on average, one large dam a day, every single day, since the Declaration of Independence.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time for that era to come to a close.\n\nBelow Friant Dam, I expected the San Joaquin to be tame -- a river on Ambien.\n\nBut because of a strange dispute between farmers and the dam\u2019s operators, far more water than usual was being allowed to flow past the dam. It looked like dough shooting out of a pasta maker as it flew into the riverbed.\n\nThis river still had some life in it.\n\nEnough to make me plenty nervous.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know who says it\u2019s a dead river\u2019\n\nI found myself wanting to control the river.\n\nI\u2019d been up all night worrying about it by the time I loaded my boat -- a 14-foot, green-and-blue Jackson Journey -- full of colorful and carefully sealed synthetic bags designed to keep my gear dry: clothes, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, tent, GPS device, notebooks, headlamp, food, John Muir journals, two cell phones (yes, I\u2019m that guy) and two GoPro cameras.\n\nMe this morning trying to make all the damn gear fit. Boat basically is the equivalent weight of an elephant. pic.twitter.com/MBKu4u8phU \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 15, 2014\n\nI didn\u2019t think about the fact that I\u2019d still have to carry it down to the water.\n\nIt must have weighed 150 pounds, and I had to enlist someone\u2019s help to haul it down a zigzagging path to the river\u2019s edge. It was only a matter of yards, but we had to stop at least five times to rest.\n\nMy hands already were raw, and I hadn\u2019t started paddling.\n\nI invited five new friends to join me for Day 1 on the river, thinking there would be safety in numbers. They included a public radio reporter, an irrigation district manager and three river advocates.\n\nHere is our San Joaquin gang for the day! River advocates, a journalist and irrigation district. #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/M7sWZ0Zfyc \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 14, 2014\n\nI was the last one in the water, on account of all my gear, which I\u2019d shoved into two portholes in the boat, one in front and one in back. By the time I\u2019d actually squeezed myself into the \u201ccockpit\u201d of the kayak -- the wobbly version of a corset fitting -- everyone else was already paddling in circles, like sharks in waiting.\n\n\u201cDo you want to warm up a bit?\u201d one person asked.\n\nNo, I said, nervous they\u2019d spot my ineptitude. Besides, I figured, I would have plenty of time to \u201cwarm up\u201d in the coming weeks.\n\nWe set off, me near the back, and immediately hit a set of rapids.\n\nI bounced through them, not realizing until later that my paddle was actually upside down, and therefore not pulling much water.\n\nI got lucky, missing the rocks and ending up in a slow-moving pool of water.\n\nIt surprised me how amazingly fun it was.\n\nWith the water moving fast, I didn\u2019t have to paddle much -- just stick my blade in every now and then to avoid running into trees.\n\nThe day zipped by, and was so perfect I wondered aloud whether a PR person with connections in the natural world had set all this up.\n\nWe saw two bald eagles.\n\nAn ancient mortar and pestle carved by American Indians.\n\nA baptism.\n\n\u201cPraise Jesus!!\u201d\n\nAnd a wedding at river right.\n\nJoel Salazar, father of the bride, carrying a crystal-topped cane, told me he didn\u2019t know the San Joaquin had been named the \u201cmost endangered\u201d river in the country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who says it\u2019s a dead river,\u201d he told me.\n\nWell, me.\n\nI\u2019d been saying that.\n\nOne day on the water, however, had shown me a river that was very much alive -- physically and spiritually. The water was blue and crisp and cold -- I could tell it was the same water that came from the snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada, up at Thousand Island Lake. It still felt alive. I dipped my arms back behind me to cool off, and the scorching sun vanished. Our group\u2019s conversation kept coming back to the religious power of water, too. Ezra David Romero, the radio reporter, was baptized in the River Jordan. Chris Acree, a Buddhist, said there\u2019s a reason the Buddha is often pictured with a lotus flower. They grow from muddy water. They rise above their surroundings to achieve enlightenment.\n\nWhen we finished paddling, 16 miles for the day, it was a celebration.\n\nMan on shore: \"Where are you going?\" Me: \"San Francisco.\" Sarcastic man: \"Yeah good luck with that.\" #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/PU6GfklWwH \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 15, 2014\n\nI felt completely at home, and totally in control.\n\nI camped alone on an island, technically still in the city of Fresno but feeling a world apart. Ezra told me there was a bar just above the bluff with 50 beers on tap. Normally, that would have sounded amazing, but I didn\u2019t want to stray far from the river. I set up my tent, inflated the sleeping pad, propped up my solar charger to boost the battery on my phone, since I\u2019d been tweeting all day, cooked a simple dinner of noodles and wrote in my journal as I watched the sun set.\n\nThe sky was playing jazz.\n\nMile 117 Attack of the killer bullfrog\n\nIn my tent, maybe two hours later.\n\nThat noise \u2026\n\nWhat is THAT NOISE?\n\nI was too afraid to crawl out to see, so I turned my headlamp to blink-so-as-possibly-to-scare-away-animals mode, picked up a book and started banging it against the floor of the tent to get the intruder\u2019s attention.\n\nSCRATCH - SCRATCH\n\nI was so freaked out that I couldn\u2019t sleep. I wrote this in my journal: \u201cSomething is rummaging around outside the tent. Hope it\u2019s not eating my food. Is it in the tree? Does it see me? I hear the rustle of leaves. Across the lake, there\u2019s an electronic-sounding GROAN-GROAN-GROAN that might be a water pump\u2026 or a wild boar.\u201d\n\nThat sound, I later learned, was actually a bullfrog.\n\nI woke up the next morning to find the intruder had eaten about a third of my food, including a treasured loaf of sourdough and a bunch of oatmeal.\n\nI\u2019d like to tell you it was a mountain lion or a bobcat, since I\u2019m told those do live in the general area. But I\u2019m guessing it was a raccoon.\n\nI laughed it off, pulled down the tent, boiled some water for coffee, and packed up the boat, ready to start a new day, fresh again. But I\u2019d be lying if I said it didn\u2019t make me feel vulnerable. What ELSE is out there, unseen and hiding in the night?\n\nWhat if it had come for me instead of the food?\n\nOn the water, things got a little better.\n\nI was joined by Tom Biglione, a naturalist-plus-insurance-company-owner who heard about my trip through a nonprofit and wanted to come along for part of it. He\u2019s the kind of person who picks milkweed seeds in his free time so he can plant them back home in Sacramento. Why? He knows monarch butterfly larvae feed only on that plant. The name of his insurance and financial services company is River View. He says he named it that to be a \u201creminder for why I work.\u201d\n\nTom, 66, provided a generous amount of logistical help -- and a great deal of river know-how. I told him about how much fun I had the day before, flying down small rapids. I also admitted that, when the water wasn\u2019t doing the moving for me, I had no idea how to make the kayak travel in a straight line.\n\nI kept bouncing from bank to bank like a pinball.\n\nTom chuckled in a knowing, fatherly way and told me I\u2019d figure things out over time.\n\nThat the boat would start to feel like part of me.\n\n\"The more you work in a boat like that the more it becomes part of you. You're wearing it\" #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/2yPEHIukTv \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 15, 2014\n\nThat couldn\u2019t have seemed further from the truth.\n\nIt felt like a cancerous growth.\n\nMile 125 \u2018KILL DEER! KILL DEER!\u2019\n\nTom can identify pretty much any bird or plant, so we spent the morning on the river, him in a canoe, me in the kayak, playing a game of \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nIt probably wasn\u2019t a very fun game for him.\n\nIt went something like this:\n\nMe: \u201cWhat\u2019s that black bird over there?\u201d\n\nTom: \u201cThat\u2019s a blackbird.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a literal example, by the way.\n\nTom taught me to distinguish plain blackbirds from red-winged blackbirds (their call sounds like AOL dial-up Internet); great blue herons (modern pterodactyls with grumpy-old-man attitudes); and great egrets (elegant white birds).\n\nThe same goes for trees. I\u2019m horrible at identifying plants, and I think that\u2019s true for almost anyone who\u2019s younger than 40 and lives in a city. But a whole new world starts to open up when you learn this stuff.\n\nTom taught me to ID sycamore (white bark), valley oak (like on golf course logos), eucalyptus (white-ish bark that\u2019s so soft and papery it\u2019s peeling), Hooker\u2019s evening primrose (an ephemeral yellow flower, meaning it only blooms for a day; and named for a botanist, not an actual hooker, which made me like it less), willow (like silver tinsel), mule fat (white fuzz, and used to fatten mules, apparently) and cottonwood (my new favorite; you can tell them by their lime-green, heart-shaped leaves that are so thin, almost like cellophane, that when the wind catches them right they make the sound of applause.)\n\nEach birdcall added a layer of complexity and excitement. I started to see reality TV show plots in their interactions -- the way the red-winged blackbird will swarm a much-larger hawk to keep it away from its young. Or, downriver, how the killdeer (named because its call sounds like someone yelling \u201cKILL DEER! KILL DEER!\u201d) pretends to have a broken wing to protect its gravel-shaped eggs. And the brown-headed cowbird. It actually abandons its young in the nests of other birds, which are either too dumb or too loving to notice and so raise the cowbirds as their own.\n\nScientists call them \u201cnest parasites.\u201d\n\nAs Tom and I navigated a forgiving stretch of river, my paddle still upside down, he taught me about several virtues of \u201creading\u201d the water.\n\nIt sounded like nonsense at first, but he assured me it would save me energy, so I listened. My shoulders were already getting sore.\n\nAmong the watery things I learned to \u201cread\u201d:\n\n1. Eddies: mini-whirlpools that cause your boat to stall, kind of like driving over a banana peel in \u201cMario Kart.\u201d They\u2019re fairly easy to spot if you know to look; and if you see them coming you can use them to your advantage.\n\n2. Strainers: Any object that is stuck in the middle of the river: a tree branch, a rock, a car (I saw lots of those, actually). Rule: ALWAYS AVOID STRAINERS.\n\n3. Currents: Water in this part of the river was flowing at maybe 2 mph, but it\u2019s not even. When the river splits into two channels, which happens often, you look on the surface for bubbles or leaves and see which side is moving faster, or which direction more of the water is choosing to take.\n\nThere are finer points to it, but the moral is to go where the water wants you to go rather than creating your own agenda. You have to work with the river, Tom said.\n\nNot against it.\n\nIf only I\u2019d listened.\n\nAfter lunch, I came upon several tests of these theories. The first was a bridge -- a roaring highway bridge, which technically was closed to boats.\n\nUm .... Ok? pic.twitter.com/WzcMPq6uKk \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 15, 2014\n\nTom followed the water between two bridge posts on the far left side of the river, anyway. Nets and wood planks partially blocked the path, and he had to duck down in his boat to slip beneath construction equipment on the underside of the bridge.\n\nI tried to follow, ran into a cement pillar, spun at 45-degrees, ducked, and somehow made it to the other side unharmed. I was glad to have a life jacket.\n\nI muttered several words I can\u2019t repeat here.\n\nThe second lesson seemed less threatening, but was worse.\n\nThe river forked, and I told Tom I thought the dominant flow went left. He disagreed and went right, which should have been a sign of things to come.\n\nMy \u201cread\u201d of the river took me careening into a thick set of trees.\n\nThe channel was a dead end, and the water was accelerating through it.\n\nWrong turn ... This is why you're supposed to \"read\" the water ... pic.twitter.com/0LB1kfnrqx \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 15, 2014\n\nThe kayak got stuck on top of a log. I couldn\u2019t paddle backward fast enough to get dislodged (I also hadn\u2019t had to paddle backward yet, and didn\u2019t really know how). So Tom came to the rescue, climbing through a thicket, with a saw (who has a saw?) that he used to cut down a tree branch blocking my way. I fidgeted around for about 15 minutes, trying to get off the log, and eventually set myself free.\n\nI turned on the GoPro on my head as I went barreling forward.\n\nThat\u2019s when the real problem started.\n\nI shot through the thicket (there literally was no channel), ducking to protect my head. I made it to the other side but was so out of balance and out of sorts that when I tried to stop up against Tom\u2019s canoe, my cockpit filled with water.\n\nI flipped -- felt the shock of the chilly water going up my back.\n\nTom: \u201cYou\u2019ve officially been strained!\u201d\n\nMy baptism in the river.\n\nLost: The GoPro, along with several days of footage.\n\nLesson: This supposedly dead river is in control.\n\nMile 137 \u2018The Other California\u2019\n\nThe San Joaquin is just the start of the Central Valley\u2019s problems.\n\nThis forgotten part of California -- the \u201cOther California\u201d as it\u2019s been aptly called -- is also home to some of the worst air quality in the country (three of the five worst U.S. cities for smog -- Visalia, Bakersfield and Fresno -- are in the valley); groundwater pollution so bad that some people, including Eunice Martinez, whom I met, can\u2019t drink from the tap and must keep jugs of bottled water by the sink; and extremely high rates of poverty.\n\nIf Central California, comprised essentially of the San Joaquin River basin, seceded from the rest of the state, it would become the poorest state in the nation, with a per capita personal income $150 lower than Mississippi\u2019s, according to a report compiled for the California legislature.\n\nIt\u2019s more West Texas than West Hollywood.\n\nA far cry from Berkeley or Silicon Valley.\n\nThere\u2019s another Central Valley superlative most people talk about: Fresno, the agricultural hub of the valley, has the worst public parks system in the nation, according to a report from the Trust for Public Land.\n\nMaybe that sounds like nothing compared to tainted drinking water, choking air quality and extreme poverty. But when I heard that stat, the valley started to make more sense to me. This is a place where people are thirsty for life. The river, meanwhile, is almost completely cut off from people who don't own land.\n\nTom and I paddled up on one park where hundreds of people were cooking, laughing and swimming along the banks of the river on a weekend evening.\n\n\"You're in a canoe but different!!\" pic.twitter.com/zGBIojLZEz \u2014 John D.

Sutter (@jdsutter) June 15, 2014\n\nBut places like that are few and far between.\n\nIt was almost impossible for me to find places to camp because so much of the river is privatized. And, at times, I had to stop for lunch on riverbanks that likely were owned by farmers.\n\nNo wonder people don't care about the river\u2019s problems.\n\nThey don\u2019t know it dries up not far from here.\n\n\"Jesus... Man I've lived out here my whole life and I've never heard of that.\" - Sergio Gonzales, 19, on dead river pic.twitter.com/SEFxLV1dco \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 16, 2014\n\nThe Central Valley grows our food -- and inherits our problems.\n\nIt\u2019s a hardscrabble place that could use a healthy river to lift its economy, and its spirits. I met people along the San Joaquin who would like to see river tours, fishing contests, festivals and community gatherings. (The Natural Resources Defense Council helped host a \u201csalmon festival\u201d near Fresno in 2013, but that seems like wishful thinking for a river without a real salmon population.)\n\nNone of that seems likely here.\n\nEven where the river flows, access is largely forbidden.\n\nSome people don't know it exists.\n\nMile 139 Walt and the 'Wall Street farmers'\n\nFloating through the Central Valley on the San Joaquin River, it\u2019s hard -- probably impossible -- to imagine what it looked like before the dams, canals and diversions. I found myself stuck in a loop of \u201csupposed tos.\u201d Is that riverbank \u201csupposed to\u201d be so steep, or is that a manmade levee that\u2019s trying to keep the water off that farmland? Is this how fast the river is \u201csupposed to\u201d be moving, or would a \u201cnormal\u201d flow be much quicker? I haven\u2019t seen any fish here: Is that normal or not?\n\nI looked at some historic photos and drawings to get a sense of what the San Joaquin is \u201csupposed to\u201d be -- a river that supported salmon and ferryboat traffic.\n\nBut the best way to really get the feel for it is to talk to Walt Shubin, an 83-year-old with a cauliflower nose and a Hemingway hardness about him.\n\nHe\u2019s one of the few people who remember the San Joaquin as it actually was.\n\nWalt Shubin is an outspoken advocate for the San Joaquin. View this photo on Instagram\n\nWalt lives on a small, organic grape farm just off the river, and he let me stay the night with him because -- surprise -- there was no public place for me to camp in the area. He offered me a \u201cmargarita\u201d -- actually a wine cooler in a blender, but it tasted like heaven -- and a sandwich with a side of cucumber-tomato salad, picked from his garden. I was exhausted from the day\u2019s paddle but we talked for hours at a two-person table in his kitchen, books and magazines, most of them about the river, piled up around us. The NBA finals were on TV.\n\n\u201cThat LeBron James is a goddamned bully,\u201d he said.\n\nWalt\u2019s not one for pulling punches.\n\nIn the first two minutes of our meeting, he called his farming neighbors \u201cecoterrorists\u201d for their overuse of water and harsh chemicals. Others, he calls \u201cWall Street farmers,\u201d since large corporations -- among them, according to a report from the Oakland Institute, insurance giants and equity firms from Silicon Valley to Switzerland -- have bought up fertile Central Valley land, contract farming it at a profit and, in the process, helping to dry up the San Joaquin.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t live without water. It\u2019s the most important thing in the world,\u201d Walt said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough water for everyone\u2019s needs, but not enough for a few rich people\u2019s greed. And that\u2019s what we have here: greed.\u201d\n\nWalt has watched the changes for almost a century.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a love affair with this river since I was 5 years old,\u201d he told me. At age 12, he built his first canoe. The river was a child\u2019s playground -- and he remembers marveling at the water and the many species it supported. He recalls a time when salmon \u201cran\u201d up the river in such a thick pack that it seemed you could skip across the river on their backs, without getting wet.\n\n\u201cJust goddamn. Like I say, wall-to-wall salmon.\u201d\n\nThe river was alive then -- connected to the sea.\n\nSalmon, I learned, require a connected river to survive. They\u2019re born in mountain streams, swim out to the ocean, hang out for three years -- and then they do something truly amazing: They swim back up the river, against the current, without eating or resting, digesting their own bodies to the point their fins start to look like webbed skeletons. They\u2019re a rare fish that morphs to survive both in fresh or saltwater -- the aquatic version of a human learning to breathe on Venus.\n\nThe salmon only have two goals for this journey, as fish biologist Jon Rosenfield explained it to me: have sex and die. They lay eggs back up in the cool, mountain waters, carefully flip their tails to make a suitable nest in the rocks for them, and then they join the great circle of life by calling it quits. They\u2019ve used all their energy making it back up stream -- and their bodies essentially become \u201c40-pound bags of fertilizer,\u201d as Jon puts it. If you drink wine from California, know that salmon likely had something to do with fertilizing it. Scientists have identified marine isotopes of nitrogen and carbon that salmon have carried up into the fields.\n\nThe salmon provided free food, and free fertilizer.\n\nBut, along the San Joaquin, that\u2019s basically over now.\n\nWhen the dams went up, and when the government gave all the water away to farms, the salmon here died, or went elsewhere. Incredibly, they can jump 10 feet (above a high-dive!) but, of course, can\u2019t leap over dams that make no accommodations for them, or flop across 40 miles of desert. There hasn\u2019t been a real salmon run in the San Joaquin since the late 1940s, said Hatler, who manages the river restoration program for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nThe plan to fix all this -- to connect the river -- is estimated to cost $900 million, said Monty Schmitt, from the Natural Resources Defense Council. Called the San Joaquin River Restoration Program, it\u2019s the result of a lawsuit filed in 1988 by environmental groups, including NRDC, and settled with the government and some water users in September 2006. The restoration program calls for a number of improvements to the river, including fish passages around dams, possible payments to farmers who own land that would be flooded if the river returns, and, importantly, increased flows to the San Joaquin to support salmon. Environmentalists are optimistic, but the effort is in political jeopardy, and critics say it may not be funded to completion.\n\nConsequently, there are doubts salmon again will be able to thrive in the San Joaquin. Walt\u2019s unsure himself. But he\u2019s hopeful.\n\n\u201cThe water just ran all over hell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was beautiful. You can\u2019t exaggerate how beautiful. \u2026 This whole country was blanketed in wildlife, like you couldn\u2019t believe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen ducks so thick it blackened the sky.\u201d\n\nNot all his memories of the valley are so dreamy. Walt\u2019s parents emigrated from Russia, fleeing the 1917 revolution. They worked as \u201cfruit tramps\u201d in California, as he describes it, living outside on sheep\u2019s wool blankets, without a tent, and picking grapes. This is the generation chronicled in \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath.\u201d\n\nWalt started working in the fields when he was 4 or 5. They worked \u201cdark \u2018til dark.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s put similar gusto into his efforts to tell people about the San Joaquin and how magical it once was and how it could be that way again. He writes letters to the editor, makes occasional speeches, and will tell anyone who asks about the river.\n\nLately, it\u2019s been harder to keep it up.\n\nWalt\u2019s wife died eight years ago, followed by two of his sons. All from cancer. Their pictures memorialize them in the living room, above the sofa.\n\n\u201cAll this s---, this cancer and asthma, and all this s---, is connected to the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning ourselves with all this bad air, bad water.\u201d\n\nWalt has to escape to the mountains because his asthma is so bad from the smog. Up in the Sierra, he can walk for miles, he told me. Down here, a walk to the yard gets him winded. He\u2019s not able to get around as quickly as his mind moves.\n\nAnd this is strange to write, but Walt told me he was thinking of committing suicide -- \u201cgoing up to Oregon,\u201d as he put it -- until he got a call from me about the river trip.\n\nThe idea of a trip down the San Joaquin -- the whole river, all the way to the sea -- is something he\u2019s dreamed of for years. When I first called him about it he just about leapt through the receiver he was so excited. Told me he wanted to do the whole thing with me if he could. His lungs aren\u2019t up to it, of course. Nor is his body.\n\nWe talked maybe a half-dozen times before I arrived in California. He kept calling back to tell me he\u2019d join me -- then, no, no, of course he couldn\u2019t. His health, his heart.\n\nThe thought of it was enough to keep him going, though.\n\nA reason for hope.\n\nEventually, I came to see Walt as the river.\n\nPast prime. On the verge of calling it quits.\n\nBut still vibrant, full of life -- a stubborn bastard of a thing.\n\nWalt promised to call to see if I made it to the Pacific -- and not to go to Oregon before that. I told him he\u2019d travel with me in spirit -- that I\u2019d share his stories of a healthier river, a whole river. That I\u2019d think of him often.\n\nThe next morning, as I set off on the water, Walt was there to wave. I spotted him again two miles downriver, peeking through the trees on the bank.\n\nThe river\u2019s spirit embodied -- and cheering me on.\n\nOff river: \u2018There is no water\u2019\n\nThe longer I spent with the river, the more frustrated I became.\n\nSomeone eventually told me my paddle was upside down, but I still couldn\u2019t control the tipsy kayak. I spent so much time trying to correct it leftward that a knot beside my right shoulder blade started screaming bloody murder with each stroke.\n\n\"We are now definitely on the portion of the river that usually does not have any water.\" #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/XefIdB83W4 \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 16, 2014\n\nI took a day off the river, both to recover -- I guess this is why you need a \u201ckayaking regimen\u201d -- and also to see what life is actually like in the Central Valley.\n\nThings only looked worse beyond the banks of the river.\n\nI caught a ride from local filmmaker Juan Carlos Oseguera to Mendota, California, where the unemployment rate is reported to be 35% to 40%, but where advocates like Dino Perez, from Westside Youth, an afterschool center, will tell you it\u2019s likely higher. Many of that town\u2019s 11,000 residents are undocumented farmworkers, and the lines for food at Dino\u2019s nonprofit have stretched down the block this summer, he said. That, as Dino made clear, is incredibly ironic. The people who are growing our nation\u2019s food are in need of food assistance. I found that infuriating.\n\nLife is hard in Mendota Ca.

He tells you \u201cthere\u2019s nothing here.\u201d\n\nThe reason?\n\nFlorentino Mendoza knows.\n\n\u201cThere is no water.\u201d\n\nEighty-two percent of California is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, but no one here needs to look at the forecast to know that.\n\nThe land is bone dry.\n\nJobs are gone.\n\nAnd wildfires have been raging in the mountains.\n\nThis is climate change in action. Farmers reportedly are paying upwards of $1,000 and $2,000 per acre-foot for water at auction, as compared to less than $100 in a wetter year, farmers and government officials told me in interviews.\n\nOnly the richest, corporate farmers survive these conditions.\n\nPeople here are cutting back on groceries to make ends meet. Less water means less farm work. #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/aSYG5iefTm \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 18, 2014\n\nThe drought is expected to cost California $2.2 billion and 17,000 jobs.\n\nNear Mendota, everyone is suffering.\n\nAs our conversation was winding down, I asked Florentino to write his name in my notebook, which is something I often do to make sure I get the spelling right, especially if I\u2019m working through an interpreter, as I was in Mendota.\n\nHe wrote in neat, deliberate cursive, the ends of the \u201cM\u201d curling like vines.\n\nMendoza's name written in my notebook. View this photo on Instagram\n\nI complimented him on his penmanship, said it was far superior to mine. He told me that that\u2019s the only thing he knows how to write -- his name.\n\nHe never had a chance to go to school, never had that opportunity back home. He fled violence in El Salvador before chasing a number of jobs in the United States.\n\nHe landed here, in a town without water -- or work.\n\nI won\u2019t soon forget him.\n\nNor will I forget George Delgado, once a farmworker like Florentino, who now owns a farm of his own. The trouble is, he doesn\u2019t have much access to water.\n\n\u201cGo back to your history! Go back to the Dust Bowl! Go back to Kansas! \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of farmers who aren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are farmers who are going to commit suicide. \u2026 You\u2019re working with a gun to your head.\u201d\n\nWorth saying again: it is DRY dry out here.

This land is useless without it.\n\nA few have bountiful access -- and the rest are left with next to nothing.\n\nFarmers like George are getting creative to try to save the resource. He has installed \u201cdrip irrigation,\u201d which is a water-saving technology. The roots of his almond trees are actually from peach trees, because they\u2019re better adapted to the soil. He\u2019s grafted them together, which I\u2019m told is relatively common.\n\nLess helpfully, other farmers are drilling deeper water wells.\n\nWhich, as I would learn, is causing the Central Valley to sink.\n\nI caught a ride with Michelle Sneed, a scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey, to a monitoring station where she and a colleague measure how fast the land is sinking. The basic concept is pretty simple: Water out, ground down.\n\n\"This is more (subsidence) than we've ever seen here before.\" Justin Brandt #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/E0esfkqDCz \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 17, 2014\n\nBut it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s invisible and largely unacknowledged.\n\nAt the time of my trip, California was the only state in the Western United States that doesn\u2019t regulate groundwater \u201cextraction,\u201d meaning farmers with deep pockets can drill wells to get to the deepest water. That likely will change, as the state recently passed new groundwater rules. But it\u2019s still an underground arms race.\n\nI asked Michelle to help me picture what\u2019s happening.\n\nShe showed me bridges that are sinking beneath canals.\n\nAnd gave me the measurement of exactly how much the ground here was sinking.\n\nTop of the shovel: that's where the ground was in the 1930s. Thank groundwater depletion. #endangeredriver @usgs @cnn pic.twitter.com/iJr4qKKO0K \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 17, 2014\n\nThe top of the shovel is where the surface of the land was in 1935.\n\nTen feet above where it is now.\n\nIn other places in the Central Valley, the rate of subsidence is worse -- the land is dropping by nearly a foot per year near Los Banos, California.\n\nOne foot per year.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is overwhelming,\u201d Michelle said.\n\nI don\u2019t blame farmers like George for trying to drill for water.\n\nIt\u2019s clear, however, there\u2019s not enough to go around.\n\nWithout regulation, this water rush won\u2019t end well.\n\nMile 163 \u2018You crazy kid!\u2019\n\nThat night, I slept at a canal-side campsite by some railroad tracks. The staff was friendly enough, and I didn\u2019t run into trouble, but it looked like the kind of place where the filmmaking Coen brothers would have someone like me murdered.\n\nDear Coen Bros: Please set a movie here. View this photo on Instagram\n\nThe next morning, I continued to paddle toward the ultimate example of this collective myopia: the place where the San Joaquin is dried up completely. I wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d approach it. I knew I\u2019d have to walk. Memories of the warnings flashed in my head: the lack of potable water, the possibly hostile landowners.\n\n.@agleader told me, half joking, that I could \"die a slow death\" trying to muck my way through some parts of the #endangeredriver out here. \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 20, 2014\n\n\u201cYou crazy kid! You poor guy!\u201d Mark Grossi, a reporter at the Fresno Bee, told me when I explained the plan. \u201cYou go wandering around, you might get shot!\u201d\n\nA farmer told me I could \u201cdie a slow death\u201d out here.\n\nI felt alone out there on the water, even though I had company. I could see the Coastal Range -- which Muir called the \u201cblue mountains\u201d -- ahead of me, to the west, near the coast. And, one afternoon, I could see the Sierras, fuzzy cloud-like figures, far behind me. The Central Valley is surrounded on three sides by mountains, and being out there, day after day, especially on the water, makes a person feel like the rest of the world, beyond the borders of the valley, has evaporated.\n\nLike this is all that exists.\n\nI carried my boat around Mendota Pool, where a \u201cwater master\u201d in an office miles from there sends the San Joaquin in and out of 20-some channels and canals. Almost all the water from the Sierras is used up by that point, and the state brings in new water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, near the coast. It\u2019s pushed back up this way by two massive government pumps -- capable of moving \u201cenough (water) to fill 170 railroad boxcars each minute\u201d -- that also are responsible for changing the flow of the delta and chewing up endangered fish.\n\nThat water already has been polluted by agriculture. It\u2019s reddish brown, warm to the touch, and crawling with algae, which snacks on the chemical fertilizer.\n\nBottom line: this is not the same water I've gotten to know all these days. That was mostly pumped out and this is in pic.twitter.com/SRP5YOGhap \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 18, 2014\n\nIt smells, it\u2019s dirty.\n\nIt\u2019s too polluted to filter and drink, according to a federal official.\n\nThe river I loved was gone.\n\nYet, people like Chris White, who told me about the \u201cwater master,\u201d described the system to me as \u201cgenius.\u201d It has to be that way, he says. These pipes and canals created jobs -- helped bring water from the wet part of the state down here.\n\nAnd I kayaked one day with a farmer who told me we were \u201cfloating on food.\u201d\n\nThe old me -- the me who couldn\u2019t tell an egret from a heron -- might have bought that argument. The Central Valley supports a large chunk of a state with a $42.6 billion agricultural economy. But now that I know this river -- know what beauty and music it\u2019s capable of creating -- know that the fish used to be so thick you could run across them -- I can\u2019t imagine how a person would see the engineered murder of a river as \u201cgenius.\u201d I see it as a tragedy that needs to be righted.\n\nI wanted to get out of this place where the ground is sinking, a river disappearing.\n\nWhere no one and everyone is to blame.\n\nBut I knew it only would get worse from there.\n\nI was approaching the desert stretch.\n\nForty miles.\n\nAnd almost no water.\n\nMile 187 A river of sand\n\nI left the kayak in a parking lot and started walking.\n\nI had no idea what I\u2019d find ahead of me, and those I\u2019d sought out for advice weren\u2019t much help, either. No one seemed to know what the dry section would look like, or where it would end. They did know where it began: here at Sack Dam, a rickety, partly wooden structure that diverts the totality of the San Joaquin, leaving only a trickle of water.\n\nNot sure if this is the end of the line? #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/wlX0huz6ni \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 19, 2014\n\nThe water goes to farmers with \u201csenior\u201d water rights, including descendants of rancher Henry Miller, who helped settle this area in the 1800s. There\u2019s a certain aspect of California water that operates like an elementary school playground.\n\nIt\u2019s finders keepers.\n\nLosers?\n\nWell, you know.\n\n(Nerd note: California\u2019s water law fuses a few different systems. The state adjudicates water rights that were claimed after 1914. That\u2019s when California started being a little less Wild West and a little more lawful. People who own land on the riverfront also can claim \u201criparian\u201d rights to the water in the river.)\n\nI expected this part of the San Joaquin -- the dry part; the \u201cdragon on the map\u201d as one woman put it -- to be where I\u2019d find the people who most desperately want a river back. It\u2019s on their land, after all. I wouldn't see until later how wrong that was.\n\nFor now, I felt lucky to have a companion on my walk:\n\nWe are off! Walking the #endangeredriver where it's dry.

Sutter (@jdsutter) June 20, 2014\n\nThat\u2019s Danielle Katz, a river nut since she was four months old, when her dad took her paddling on the Stanislaus River, a tributary of the San Joaquin. Now 33, she started a non-profit called Rivers for Change, which aims to use source-to-sea river trips for educational purposes. She tried to make a trip down the San Joaquin in 2012 and failed because it was too dry. She heard about my expedition and told me she\u2019d walk the dry section of the river with me. It interested her in part because it\u2019s so mysterious.\n\nWe walked maybe 1\u00bd miles past Sack Dam, following a levy, wobbly silhouettes of farmworkers off in the distance, before we came to this:\n\nThis is where the water ends.

Some people use it as a road; others farm in what could be considered part of the now-dry riverbed. At the edge of the sand, I stood on top of the cracked earth. The pieces of dried-up clay wiggled beneath my feet like loose teeth. I saw a dead crustacean on this moonscape.\n\nFormer reaident. Cicadas sound like tinnitus.

Absolutely none of that water is left. And the obvious question -- where did it go? -- is answered oh-so easily when you\u2019re standing in a place like this.\n\nLook around at the edge of the river-beach.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the emerald-green farms.\n\nWelp.

Sutter (@jdsutter) June 20, 2014\n\nIt\u2019s goofy, I know.\n\nBut maybe it would help prove this river is still navigable.\n\nStill alive.\n\nAnd, in some small way, still worth saving.\n\nMile 188 I drank and drank and drank\n\nDanielle and I stopped for a brief lunch, and soon reality set in: We\u2019d be trudging, through thigh-burning beach sand, for days, under a relentless sun, with virtually no shade. By midafternoon of Day 1, I was completely covered in sweat. Salt lines formed around my elbows and on my chest. I tied a bandanna underneath my hat just to keep the rays off my neck and the saltwater from dripping into my eyes.\n\nIt was that light-headed, nearly hallucinating kind of heat -- the kind so tangible it wiggles the horizon. It was absolutely miserable, but I thought of the farmworkers I met in Mendota, imagined them picking melons under this same sun. I felt awful for fixating on my own woes -- the pack digging into my right hip like a knife.\n\nThe #endangeredriver would be a sexy bastard in this channel if it had water. Quick turns. Narrow. (I'm losing it) pic.twitter.com/aC6BvCBqfL \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 21, 2014\n\nThen I noticed a legitimate gripe, no matter the circumstance.\n\nWe were running out of water.\n\nIt was my fault, of course.\n\nI probably made the water too easy to drink -- hanging a hose from the 3-liter \u201cbladder\u201d of water in my backpack over my shoulder, near my mouth.\n\nAll I had to do was move my head a few inches to take a sip.\n\nSo I drank -- and drank and drank.\n\nI could feel the pack getting lighter, knew the reservoir was emptying.\n\nI couldn't help it, it was hot, and I was freaking thirsty.\n\nI didn\u2019t worry about it too much at first -- since I knew we had a large jug of water waiting for us near our projected campsite, 10 miles from the start.\n\nBut mile after mile of trudging through ankle-deep sand is just as hard as it sounds to anyone who\u2019s tried to run on a beach. Each step takes about 17 times the energy you think it should, all of your effort absorbed by the granular surface.\n\nThis feels like a stair master in hell pic.twitter.com/QmL2ksdrC0 \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 21, 2014\n\nI really noticed how tired I was -- and how fast I was downing all my water -- when Danielle stopped near the Highway 152 bridge, which crosses the dry river, and is labeled with a neat, green government sign -- to recharge in the shade.\n\nSo strange and kinda great that from the river's perspective you can't see the cars. From above, u never see rivers pic.twitter.com/qGnAAM9RGZ \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 21, 2014\n\nMy feet were throbbing -- Danielle\u2019s were covered in blisters -- and, even though I was wearing long pants, my legs were completely caked in dust.\n\nTaking a break. This is sooo much harder than I expected. Gross feet. Been about 7/8 mi dry so far #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/BBkl1UZsMj \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 21, 2014\n\nI knew I had to keep going forward for the people following this journey -- and for Walt Shubin, the farmer who was counting on me to finish. How crushed he would be to see, as I was, a once-vibrant river drained and forgotten. It\u2019s almost unthinkable that the second longest river in California could be intentionally killed -- left as a desert in a little-traveled part of the Central Valley. I had to think that perhaps more people would be outraged (is anyone but me outraged?) by the death of the San Joaquin if the dry riverbed were more visible.\n\nWe trudged on, but the reality remained: It was 6 p.m. and we hadn\u2019t made it halfway to the campsite. Soon, the sun was setting overhead, turning the sky a haunting purple. Danielle walked ahead of me at this point, so far I couldn\u2019t see her. And I didn\u2019t have the cell service to be able to call if I\u2019d needed to find her. I heard owls hooting at dusk, saw a raccoon that was following me along the path.\n\nThere was a surreal and beautiful quality about the scene.\n\nStill, I was anxious.\n\nWhere were we going, exactly? And did we have the water to get there?\n\nI walked up on a levee to get a better view of the surroundings. Each step up there, on the firm ground, as opposed to the dusty riverbed, felt like a leap forward. I didn\u2019t want to cheat by walking up there, but it was nearly dark, and I wanted to get my bearings. During the 30 minutes or so I spent up on the levee I saw a tractor driving by. I thought of the warnings I\u2019d received about the hostility of the landowners in this area -- and the shotgun shells I\u2019d seen in the river. I briefly considered hopping behind some shrubbery to hide. But it was dark enough that I decided instead to do what the animals do: stand still and wait for it to pass.\n\nThe tractor was dragging a ghost-like smoke behind it. A cloud hung over the field, suspended in time. There was no wind to move it, and I wondered what it was.\n\nThe air tasted like Sudafed tablets, and I hurried past.\n\nDanielle and I made it to our campsite, on the edge of a green plot of tomato plants, by 10 p.m., thirsty and starved. We\u2019d left a jug of water out here in advance, thank God. We each chugged a bottle-full and then used it to make macaroni and cheese on my small camping stove.\n\nDanielle takes on the river\u2019s problems as her own, and she\u2019ll do anything possible to try to avoid letting her presence harm the river. So, when we\u2019d finished eating, she asked me to do something I thought was completely bonkers: She told me that when I washed the cheese-coated pot out with water, by hand, that I should drink the cheesy dishwater instead of pouring it on the ground.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want it to contaminate the river, even though there\u2019s no discernible river here. Even though we were camping on the edge of a fertilized, irrigated farm. I complained about this loudly for maybe 10 minutes before just doing it.\n\nTo me, it had started to seem like there wasn\u2019t a river here to protect.\n\nMile 197 They \u2018own it to the bottom\u2019\n\nThe next morning, I started shuffling around, per usual: squishing my sleeping pad into its storable, cylindrical shape; snapping my tentpoles into neat bundles, like fiberglass firewood kindling; pouring just exactly the right amount of water into a lightweight pot and then boiling it for lumpy, not-too-wet oatmeal and a little coffee.\n\nI even drank the oatmeal water -- bluh -- to placate Danielle.\n\nThat\u2019s when Danielle told me we\u2019d had an overnight visitor: A tractor, which had left a noticeable trail of a powdery yellow chemical all around our campsite.\n\nWe\u2019d been fertilized.\n\nDanielle had heard the tractor spraying a nearby field and, consequently, us, between the hours of midnight and 1 a.m. I later would learn that farming is such an intense industry out here that, during planting and harvest, someone is working somewhere on these farms at every hour of the day and night. What I never learned is the exact composition of that chemical. It could have been fertilizer, one man told me; or sulfur, which farmers spray on crops to keep them from getting \u201csunburned.\u201d\n\nI was so exhausted, and so fully asleep, I hadn\u2019t noticed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long until we had another visitor.\n\nChase is walking with me this morning, explaining where post-river water goes to and comes from #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/gCF55enIH1 \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 21, 2014\n\nThat\u2019s Chase Hurley, who runs the local irrigation district, which is responsible for moving water from the former riverbed onto the fields of these nearby farmers.\n\nHe was sent here, essentially, to stop us from following the river.\n\nThat\u2019s being a little blunt, perhaps. I talked with a farmer in the area, Cannon Michael, who told me I couldn\u2019t walk along the river the entire way -- that some landowners, he said, didn\u2019t want me \u201con their land,\u201d meaning, more or less, on the river or along its former banks.\n\nHe\u2019d called Chase and asked him to accompany me. I didn\u2019t object to this, since I thought it would be nice to have a guide. But I didn\u2019t intend to back down from my plan to follow the riverbed.\n\nI asked if I\u2019d be trespassing.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good question,\u201d Chase said.\n\nThose locals \u201cown it to the bottom.\u201d\n\nThat can\u2019t be true, can it? Rivers are held in the public trust -- a resource for everyone. But what if the river\u2019s dry and has been for decades? Does that let someone own it? What if that person is also the someone who helped dry it up?\n\nI didn\u2019t want to back down. Then I realized I had to. A few miles down the path, the riverbed started to fill with pesticide-laden pools of agricultural drain-water.\n\nIt wouldn't be possible to walk through them. I couldn\u2019t make it through the contested land without having to \u201ctrespass\u201d by stepping out of the riverbed.\n\nWider view. The San Joaquin has water intermittently here.

(I wasn\u2019t able to get them to comment on the record).\n\nThe general sentiment in the area seems to be that the river restoration plan is a waste of money, could ruin useful farmland -- and could flood homes that are located on or near the banks of the river.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to spoil a lot of ground\u201d if water returns to the San Joaquin, said Tom Gage, a pest control adviser I met in the area.\n\n\"Well I hope this is going to be a two sided story.\" Dog's name is Elka.

Sutter (@jdsutter) June 23, 2014\n\nI pulled the boat with a parachute cord that Tom -- the insurance guy and bird lover who paddled with me a week before -- tied up for me.\n\nWithout that, I would have been a goner.\n\nMy day, in a photo. Pulling pulling pulling. Back and hands are so sore. View this photo on Instagram\n\nI hoisted the 100-pound boat over three beaver dams and finally came to a clearing. Amazing! I thought. Maybe the water would pick up from there.\n\nInstead, I found the quicksand.\n\nAnd the river flowing backward.\n\nThe Barry White mud, remember?\n\nI was stuck up to my knees.\n\nRiver is flowing backwards here. This is just exhausting. Dumped gear. Still lugging boat #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/rsQBfA14JL \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 23, 2014\n\nExhibit a pic.twitter.com/SJnBQqss6f \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 23, 2014\n\nI panicked. Bubbles of air started rising through the mud like Champagne as my leg sank deeper. I could feel the mud grabbing onto my limbs, vacuum-sucking them. It felt like I was tied up in plastic wrap, then plaster mold. I tried high stepping, I tried twist-wiggling, I tried shuffling forward, leaning back -- nothing worked.\n\nThen it hit me: the kayak!!\n\nIt was within reach, thanks to the string Tom had tied for me.\n\nI grabbed the loop and pulled it close.\n\nProbably 20 minutes later, I\u2019d successfully used it to ratchet myself out of the mud -- hoisting myself up with my arms, like a flabby-armed gymnast on the pommel horse.\n\nIt was a sweaty, panicked, maddening experience.\n\nAnd before you think I\u2019m exaggerating, know that I later met a fish biologist, Lenny Grimaldo, who told me the same thing happened to him.\n\nAnd he dislocated his hip trying to escape.\n\nI got stuck several more times -- all told spending at least an hour sticking and unsticking myself from the quicksand. Then there was the business of what to do once I was unstuck. Ever so cautiously, one step at a time, I made my way to the dry \u201cbank\u201d of the river. I couldn\u2019t drag my 100-pound kayak across the land, much less carry it, so I decided to unload all my food and gear.\n\nI left it behind, dragged the empty kayak forward, and then went back for the gear.\n\nWash, rinse, repeat.\n\nIt was absolutely exhausting. I counted my steps to try to take my mind off the misery -- \u201c58, 59, 60 \u2026\u201d I tried to make it to 100 before giving myself a break, but often couldn\u2019t. I wondered how I\u2019d ever get out of this situation -- how I\u2019d ever reach the sea. I was falling so far behind my daily mileage goal I couldn\u2019t bear to think of it.\n\nI thought about giving up right there in the mud field.\n\nBut there really wasn\u2019t any way off this river.\n\nThere were steep banks on both sides.\n\nNowhere to go but forward.\n\nI trudged on, stopping for the day at about 8:30 p.m. I set up camp along the still-muddy river, which was stagnant, but now really flowing.\n\nI'm alive. Set up camp/ cooking noodles. Loooong day. By far the hardest so far, dragging the boat #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/CkyAowtQFn \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 24, 2014\n\nFrogs out here sound like busted cellos. But these coyotes ... Kinda freaking me out. Like RIGHT across river from sound of it. \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 24, 2014\n\nThe howls of nearby coyotes kept me up in a panic.\n\nMile 240 \u2018You won\u2019t make it to the Bay\u2019\n\nThe next day, I would meet the man who makes the river flow backward.\n\nI like this guy's spunk. \"You won't make it to the Bay..you'd better be one f'ing good paddler\" I have my doubts too! pic.twitter.com/tp4sfUG45u \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 24, 2014\n\nIn addition to telling me that, yes, his water pump on the river is what\u2019s making it flow backward in the spot where I got stuck in the mud, he also offered this little bit of inspiration: \u201cYou won't make it to the bay.\u201d I\u2019d have to be \u201cone f---ing good paddler\u201d to do that, he said, and apparently I didn\u2019t look like one.\n\n(This doesn\u2019t make him mean so much as observant, I guess).\n\nThe particulars on this little ray of sunshine: His name is Bob Kelley. \u201cMy great-great grandfather, and his father, arrived where we are today in 1852. They stepped off of a river boat\u201d that had come up the San Joaquin River.\n\nI don\u2019t need to remind you how impossible that is now.\n\nI wanted to hate Bob -- I really did.\n\nI mean, he told me I\u2019m on an impossible quest. And the water he\u2019s sucking directly out of the river -- 10,000 acre-feet in total per year, he told me, out of eight pumps -- for use on his family\u2019s land should have kept me from getting trapped in quicksand. He\u2019s playing a small part in making sure boats and fish can\u2019t traverse the San Joaquin -- that this part of the river remains mysterious and impassible.\n\nBut he was also so accommodating. Kind, almost.\n\nAfter I spent maybe 30 minutes dragging my boat up to a tree and locking it to a branch with a lock that normally goes on my bicycle, he picked me up at a boat ramp near my coyote-laden campsite. His black GMC Denali truck has stair-step things that drop down automatically, and his car stereo was playing Billie Holiday.\n\nHow can you hate a farmer who plays Billie Holiday?\n\nBut, anyway, back to business.\n\nHere are Bob\u2019s thoughts on the river:\n\n1. Salmon won\u2019t make it here. They\u2019d expect to stick their thumbs out and hitchhike since that\u2019s the treatment they\u2019ve been given to date by the enviros.\n\n2. His water rights are great, but so what? Look at your history. \u201cThat water was created (emphasis mine, but wow) as a result of federal and state projects,\u201d he said referring to the scarce, expensive water that is given (or not, this year) to farmers in other parts of the valley. \u201cOur ancestors developed their water as a result of their own investment.\u201d Well, is that fair today? I mean, you didn\u2019t build those dams. \u201cBy nature, it\u2019s going to make some people happier than other people.\u201d Count him among the happy bunch.\n\n3. On his connection to the land and water: \u201cI\u2019ve walked every inch of this ranch -- many times. \u2026 Every morning, I\u2019m out walking a different part of the ranch.\u201d Favorite animal? The river otter, which he\u2019s only seen a few times. \u201cAll the animals out here, they\u2019re survivors, they\u2019re interesting to me. Even if I have to kill \u2018em, like a coyote or a beaver \u2026 I still respect \u2018em.\u201d\n\n4. On the fact that he\u2019s making the river go backward and that I got really, really truly stuck in it -- almost hip-dislocatingly stuck? He wasn\u2019t so much apologetic as practical. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta go out there and locate the beaver dams and trap the beavers so we can keep the water flowing to the pumps.\u201d He later asked me to point to a map on his iPad to show him where the beavers were living. I felt like an evil accomplice in that moment, but it was a trade-off: He did drive me into town because I was out of sunscreen.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a hard time sympathizing with him.\n\nHe\u2019s putting the river to work, dammit.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s the way it\u2019s gotta be.\n\nMile 250 Deformed birds and an AR-15\n\nThe gurgling, backward-flowing mess of a river had eaten days off my itinerary and worn my patience thin. I was mad at the river, mad at the conflict it creates.\n\nI\u2019d survived but had completely forgotten about Walt, the spirit of the river.\n\nI went into survival mode -- trying to do anything I could to make up time. I just wanted to catch back up to my schedule and get off the water. Efficient, done. My hands were covered in calluses and one blister that looked like the red spot on Jupiter. My head hurt, my feet were tired, and all my clothes were covered in mud.\n\nThe river wasn\u2019t helping me any, either. The winds were picking up -- the \u201cdelta breeze,\u201d from the coast, which is a completely ridiculous euphemism. Ripples turned to whitecaps. And that\u2019s when there was water. The flows in the river were so low, thanks to the drought and, mostly, to widespread diversions of all the San Joaquin\u2019s tributaries -- the Merced, Stanislaus and Tuolumne -- that I still had to pull my boat across sandbars every few minutes.\n\nI didn\u2019t really care about this river anymore.\n\nI started to see it as a hiding place for sordid activity.\n\nEarlier in the trip, I heard a woman screaming for help beneath a highway bridge. I stopped to see what was going on and her boyfriend, she told me, had just pushed a giant barrel of water on top of her. She was living under that bridge, by the river, in a tent, out of sight of law enforcement, and off society\u2019s radar entirely. I worried she had a concussion and tried to call for medical help. At her request, I went into town to tell a friend of hers to go take her to safety. What had happened to her was clearly a crime, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to turn him in. It was too painful.\n\nShe worried it could get worse.\n\nLater, I saw a man walking along a marshy bank with an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. (Based on warnings I received, I\u2019m guessing he was guarding pot.)\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge, where scientists in the 1980s found hundreds of birds deformed by agricultural drain-water that was high in selenium. That element occurs naturally in some of the soil out here, but over-irrigating the land makes it concentrate and turn deadly.\n\nOne of the uncomfortable things I learned on my trip down the #endangeredriver.

I started to doubt if seeing any of this, if listening to the river and its people, and reporting it back to you, would matter to anyone but me.\n\nMile 251 The river as a mirror\n\nBut the Frankenriver found a way to win me over.\n\nSomething kinda cool and a little \u201cTruman Show\u201d started happening.\n\nPeople started finding me on the river.\n\nLike, Internet people.\n\nFirst, it was this guy: Danny Royer. He showed up at a bridge in the dry section of the river to tell me about how much he wants the river back, including salmon, and how he thinks there are practical solutions farmers would support to get it there.\n\nDanny Royer stopped by to chat. View this photo on Instagram\n\nLater it would be Lynn Miller, who stood on this water pump, 30 to 50 feet above the river, for two hours just waiting for me to pass by.\n\n\u201cAre you John!?\u201d she yelled.\n\n\"It's the only place I've ever known.\" -@lamlr2 on her family farm in the Ca Delta #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/dUY4hmeavC \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) June 28, 2014\n\nShe waited all that time -- two hours!! -- to tell me about her farm.\n\nAnd on this day, it was a family of Earth science teachers. Ryan and Laura Hollister found me on Twitter and told me they would bring me a burrito and meet me under a highway bridge not too far from where they live in Turlock, California. I told them that sounded, like, earth-shatteringly incredible (Premade food! That\u2019s not a Cliff bar! Or muddy!), and that\u2019d I\u2019d pay them back for it. They wouldn\u2019t take money, so I bartered my services as a Skype guest at one of their classes in the fall.\n\nHere\u2019s our selfie, shot beneath a bridge where the Merced River joins the San Joaquin. Like all bridges on the river, it\u2019s full of swallow\u2019s nests.\n\nRyan, Laura and Zephyr Hollister brought me a burrito after reading my #endangeredriver tweets!

Sutter (@jdsutter) June 25, 2014\n\nAs if to prove the point, Zephyr, their now-18-month-old who looks more or less like that ETrade baby and was wearing a Beetlejuice-striped T-shirt, started crawling around in the river, getting mud on his face and (yeah, we tried to stop him) putting the river in his mouth. I couldn\u2019t help but think of all the \u201cRiver People\u201d I\u2019d met on this trip, including these folks. In a world that\u2019s turning away from the water, pretending it appears like magic from a faucet, these guys are doing everything in their power to reconnect to a natural system, and to try to learn something from it.\n\nThey\u2019re conserving in a state that flouts its limits. California Gov. Jerry Brown has asked residents to voluntarily cut water use by 20%. \u201cAt some point we have to learn to live with nature -- we have to get on nature\u2019s side, and not abuse the resources that we have,\u201d Brown said at a press conference January 17. Residents responded by increasing use 1%, according to news reports.\n\nNow the state has approved $500 daily fines for water use violations, including hosing off driveways, washing a car with a hose or overwatering a lawn\n\n(Farmers aren\u2019t subject to those rules, but thousands of \u201cjunior\u201d water rights holders did receive letters saying they wouldn't get any water this year, said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California).\n\nCalifornia needs more people like Ryan and Laura.\n\nAnd Danielle -- whose cheese-water-sipping ways were starting to sound less insane. The longer I spent with these dedicated folks the more I realized I\u2019d never be able to turn on a tap and think of water -- or not think of it -- the same way again.\n\nBefore I left, I promised Ryan and Laura I\u2019d create my own water budget.\n\nAnd figure out where my water in Atlanta comes from, exactly.\n\nBon voyage @jdsutter! It was an awesome meet & eat. You're inspiring many people to reconnect to their river. pic.twitter.com/WOeiiO93Wz \u2014 Ryan Hollister (@phaneritic) June 25, 2014\n\nTheir dedication kept me going.\n\nOne night not long after that, in the hour or two before sunset, I found a patch of continuous water that allowed me to paddle, uninterrupted by sandbars and mud.\n\nThe going was tough. There was a stiff headwind and I worried I wouldn\u2019t make it to the spot where I knew I\u2019d been able to find camping. It became sort of a mini-challenge: Get to that preplanned campsite and all of it will be fine. Forget about the flow readings and whatever comes tomorrow. Just exist with this river now.\n\nAnd it worked. I turned my brain off and put my shoulders into a gear that\u2019s higher than I knew possible weeks before, when I started paddling at Friant Dam.\n\nI'm finally finding my groove as a kayaker. View this photo on Instagram\n\nWith no one around to hear, I sang out loud -- mostly \u201cProud Mary,\u201d the Tina Turner live version, of course; and, yes, I can hear you judging me.\n\nI pressed on into a silver sun.\n\n\u201cThe rivers flow not past, but through us, thrilling, tingling, vibrating every fiber and cell of the substance of our bodies, making them glide and sing.\u201d -- John Muir\n\nThe light was dancing on the water.\n\nIt occurred to me that the river is a mirror.\n\nIt reflects the best of us -- and the worst.\n\nMile 300 The heart of the river\n\nMy boat almost floated away without me.\n\nI woke up on an island, maybe 30 miles south of Stockton, the industrial hub of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region, to find the water had risen while I slept.\n\nIt was the tide!\n\nI didn\u2019t realize I was so close to the coast.\n\nThe delta, I would discover, is really the heart of the San Joaquin River. In one day of paddling, the river filled with water -- thanks to the Sacramento River, joining it from the north, and the tides swelling in from the turbulent bay -- and teemed with life. I saw Jet Skiers, fisherwomen and a man digging for clams with his bare feet. There were motorboats with sound systems loud enough to fill a concert venue.\n\n\"You can feel all alone out here right in the middle of the city.\" - Ryan Johnson, 29, out fishing under a cottonwood pic.twitter.com/arIzaQq1LA \u2014 John D.

Went in a bar called the Rusty Porthole, which has photos of semi-naked water skiing contests (from January!) on the wall. People in the delta use this river in a way I hadn\u2019t seen in weeks, and I was just so floored to take all of it in. I felt like I\u2019d been out in the wilderness -- talking mostly to mud and coyotes -- for an eternity. When I saw the suburban, tiled roofs of Stockton by the river channel, it was like I\u2019d never seen a housing development in my life before. Wow! People! They live here!\n\nAnd, oh man, are the People of The Delta a trip.\n\nI met a bartender who commutes by boat.\n\nReasons I love the California Delta: 1. This bartender commutes by boat.

Sutter (@jdsutter) July 2, 2014\n\nEcological problems are hiding just beneath the surface in the delta, of course. The delta is dying, in part, because it doesn\u2019t get enough water from the San Joaquin River, and others, to hold the ocean back. (In a drought year, the San Joaquin system dumps perhaps 10% of its \u201cunimpaired flow\u201d into the Delta, according to Peter Vorster. The Bay Institute, where he works, is advocating for that to be increased to 50% -- half what the river should be -- but that\u2019s still seen as heretical.)\n\nThe water is also salty, which is trouble for fish and crops.\n\nTwo government pumping facilities, which send water back up the San Joaquin River to keep it on life support as well as down to Los Angeles, have proved deadly for endangered species like the tiny, harmless delta smelt, which just might be the most reviled fish in California. I heard people talking about it up and down the Central Valley, because its presence slows down or stops water pumping.\n\nI visited an apocalyptic \u201crefuge\u201d population of the fish off the river.\n\nLots of people hate or mock the delta smelt b/c it's existence slows water pumping. I found it cool to meet them. pic.twitter.com/lUJEKvyKni \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) July 1, 2014\n\nHere's the place they raise delta smelt.

They\u2019re already well below sea level, and below the surface of the river.\n\nBut don\u2019t tell Bill or other \u201cdelta rats\u201d about any of that.\n\nI kayaked up to his houseboat, which is tied to a sunken barge.\n\nMet an interesting Delta character this morning: Bill Conner, 83.

Sutter (@jdsutter) July 2, 2014\n\nWe talked at the cramped table inside, a ukulele and a flashlight dangling from strings between us. I told him that the advocacy group American Rivers had named the San Joaquin the \u201cmost endangered\u201d in the United States.\n\n\u201cF--- \u2018em,\u201d he said, not missing a beat.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of bulls---.\u201d\n\nTo him, the river is perfect.\n\nHe loves it too much to see its flaws.\n\nMile 330 Crushed by a cargo ship\n\nTo make it through the delta and into San Francisco Bay, I\u2019d need a sidekick.\n\nI didn\u2019t want one, at first.\n\nI imagined floating under the Golden Gate Bridge alone, in the same blue-and-green boat -- plus a lot of dents and scratches -- that I\u2019d been with for so many miles. I had it all planned: I\u2019d dip my arms lazily in the salty, ocean water and gaze up at the bridge. I\u2019d have some sort of epiphany about this three-week, epic journey.\n\nIt wouldn't be like that -- like, at all.\n\nI received three warnings about the bay-delta.\n\nFirst: \u201cYou can be in the middle of the delta -- half a mile from any shore -- and not see land,\u201d said Danielle, the kayaker who walked the dry section with me.\n\nThe waves whitecap, she said, and they\u2019re big enough to flip you.\n\nDo you know any open-water rescues?\n\nI didn\u2019t even know what that meant, and was instantly convinced I needed a buddy. Luckily, John Dye, a friend of hers from Rivers for Change and a kayak racer, volunteered to paddle through the San Francisco Bay with me. He wore spandex shorts and, initially, a matador\u2019s hat, the kind with red balls dangling from the brim.\n\nHere's John! We are heading out #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/JqnSqEUogF \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) July 2, 2014\n\nWe would paddle a two-person kayak -- which is nicknamed the \u201cdivorce boat,\u201d John said, because if your movements aren\u2019t in sync, everything goes haywire. It was made of brittle, yellow fiberglass. It was beautiful.

Survived, w/glasses pic.twitter.com/TCqLOaEORX \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) July 3, 2014\n\nThat\u2019s Wayne Kocher. Age: 77.\n\nNumber of times he\u2019s been run over by a cargo ship: one.\n\nHe somehow survived, with those glasses still on his face. No string.\n\nBut hearing his tale had me spooked. In 2007, he was sucked underneath an enormous boat on a 340-mile kayaking race down the Missouri.\n\nWhat guts, I thought.\n\nAnd what insanity.\n\nWhen the river first started shifting toward the industrial, growing ungodly cranes and smokestacks and supporting boats that looked like downed skyscrapers, my stomach churned with a nervous excitement. I smiled ear to ear.\n\nMade it to Pittsburg! The California version. Still industrial. This is a boat on New York Slough. #endangeredriver pic.twitter.com/WrK00KWdAC \u2014 John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) July 3, 2014\n\nIt was like being on a roller coaster.\n\nBut Wayne\u2019s story made me a little sick to my stomach.\n\nThe third and final warning came from a park-bench prophet.\n\nAs John and I were paddling out of Pittsburg, California, where we\u2019d slept on the deck of a boating club, our tiny kayak tied up next to yachts, a guy with a goatee and a motorcycle called out to us from a bench on the edge of the marina.\n\nMoto-prophet: You\u2019re not paddling out to the bay IN THAT, are you?\n\nMe: Is that a bad idea?\n\nGoatee guy: I remember a young man -- looked like you. He was paddling one of them boats like you\u2019ve got out to the bay. He flipped it over. Got stuck on an island out by Martinez for two days before anyone could find him. Thought he was dead.\n\nPerfect, I thought.\n\nThere might not be a triumphant end to this odyssey.\n\nMile 392 Silent ghosts on the Bay\n\nThe sky was gray and the winds were howling.\n\nFour-foot waves crashed into my chest.\n\nIt was July 4, and John and I were battling our way across San Pablo Bay on what I hoped would be my final day on the water, the day I\u2019d planned to reach the Golden Gate. The wind and tide were making that seem less likely. I\u2019d been mentally prepared for a hard push to the finish, but this 10-mile-wide bay, which begins about 25 miles northeast of the bridge, would test me in ways I never imagined.\n\nThe low that morning was 51. My teeth were chattering and my arms shaking. My right shoulder had been sore for days, to the point it had become difficult to raise my arm above horizontal. Banal tasks like putting on a shirt, even taking notes, had become seriously painful. This was excruciating, and it was just beginning. The Unity kayak, me in the front, John at back, teetered through the waves like a seesaw, driving me nearly underwater as we dropped off the crests and into the troughs below. Salt stuck to my face, making my forehead feel like cellophane.\n\nThe fog was dense, with no sign of shore in sight.\n\nBarges emerged from the clouds like silent ghosts.\n\nWe fought our way into the middle of the bay. It was still morning, maybe 10 a.m. My mind was churning faster than the waves. I couldn't imagine how we\u2019d make it through an entire day of this. I was fading, and John, who does 100-mile kayak races just for fun, was stressed out, too, which worried me even more. Every now and then he\u2019d yell out instructions: put the blade into the top of the wave and try to launch us OVER it; don\u2019t let the waves determine your rhythm; just stay steady and keep moving. I could tell he was nervous, too, and exhausted. It probably didn\u2019t help that my strokes became frantic and uneven, like a short-circuiting windmill.\n\nThe bay was taking control of me.\n\nIt felt like being in a washing machine.\n\nNo steady point of reference, no way to calm my nerves.\n\nIn this moment of chaotic limbo -- unable to see a destination, unclear of the way forward -- I started to feel just incredibly sad.\n\nI wish I could explain that better than I can, but the truth is I broke down in tears out on the bay, the waves crashing into my face and wiping them away. My arms were burning, but that wasn\u2019t it, really. I felt heartbroken for the river -- and for the people who depend on it. None of the cool water I\u2019d touched at Thousand Island Lake, 24 days before -- not one drop -- had made it here with me. I thought about Walt, how happy he would be to see how much life the river still has in it down here -- its salty defiance, the possibility of great whites below.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it at the time, but Walt had left me a voice mail that day. He\u2019d written down the date I\u2019d expected to be at the Golden Gate. I didn\u2019t know if I would make it to the finish, but he did. \u201cI just wanted to let you know you\u2019re my hero,\u201d he said.\n\nWeeks before, an irrigation district manager had described the San Joaquin\u2019s connection to the sea to me as a \u201cmystical blue line.\u201d Mystical not because he respects it, but because he thinks it unnecessary. The river serves his clients -- the farmers -- just fine, whether or not it reaches the Pacific. He joked about the environmentalists who want to spend hundreds of millions to connect the river to the ocean, just to make themselves feel better about the circle of life.\n\nBut the symbolism matters, in ways both spiritual and practical. We\u2019ve robbed the river of its most basic and earthly functions: bringing sediment and water to the ocean, allowing fish to live. We\u2019ve broken it from the natural cycle. This is a high-functioning, valuable system. It\u2019s free food, free fertilizer, free water.\n\n\u201cEverything is flowing -- going somewhere,\u201d John Muir wrote in his journals, \u201canimals and so-called lifeless rocks as well as water.\u201d\n\nNone of that\u2019s true here.\n\nWe\u2019ve basically killed this river.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in blaming any one person or group.\n\nWhat does that say about all of us?\n\n\u201cSentiment without action is the ruin of the soul,\u201d the environmentalist and river advocate Edward Abbey is often quoted as saying.\n\nWhat will we become if we just accept that some rivers spoil drinking water and fail to reach the sea because we\u2019ve completely tapped them out?\n\nThere won\u2019t be a river at all -- period -- in 100 years.\n\nJust pipes and ditches.\n\nNo one wants to live in that world.\n\nIn the climate change era, things will only worsen. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is projected to decline by as much as 70% to 90% in coming decades.\n\nSevere droughts are going to be the norm.\n\nThe state needs to learn to live within its means -- and to stop living out the 1940s fantasy it can \u201ccreate\u201d water by building more dams and canals.\n\nThis really puts water in perspective\u2026 The two super tiny spheres represent all fresh water and all river/lake water. pic.twitter.com/unPrtJDfN6 \u2014 John D.

We also had a goal -- and the longer we waited, the more the tide would start working even harder against us.\n\nWe could expect bigger winds and bigger waves.\n\nI tried to get mentally prepared.\n\nI did so by reverting to the technique that had worked for me under the silver sun a week ago: singing to myself, out loud if necessary. It helps me keep a rhythm and avoid panic, especially as monster waves threatened to collapse our boat.\n\nMy soundtrack for the day: \u201cSittin' on the Dock of the Bay,\u201d by Otis Redding.\n\nIts beat is steady and calm -- \u201cwatching the ships roll in / then I\u2019ll watch \u2018em roll away again\u201d -- and it had a serious de-stressing effect on me. The waves started to look like challenges to overcome -- hurdles to spike my paddle into. Not monsters.\n\nI started to think that we could do this.\n\nIt took me three weeks on the San Joaquin -- flying into trees, bouncing over waves, gripping the paddle so tightly that I got blisters and headaches -- to realize we need to start living with the water, rather than trying to control it. It\u2019s human nature to want to subvert the water cycle -- to try to prevent floods and make water ever-present and always available. But we do so at our own peril.\n\nWe\u2019re crushing vital natural systems, including salmon fisheries.\n\nWe\u2019re taking the spirit and the magic out of the natural world.\n\nJohn and I stopped for lunch at a place called Red Rock, a towering hunk of, well -- red rock -- beneath the Richmond Bridge in the middle of the bay.

To our surprise, the clouds started to break.\n\nJohn D. Sutter\n\nA thick line of clouds sat on top of the hills separating us from the Pacific. It almost looked like a field of snow on the mountains. I thought back to Thousand Island Lake -- and wished I\u2019d thought to bring a jar of that water with me.\n\nIf only it could experience this magical scene.\n\nMy first glimpse of the Golden Gate came around the point at Tiburon, as we entered what John said would be the most challenging stretch of our paddle: Raccoon Straits.\n\nI didn\u2019",

We estimate that one in three people has a poor diet,\" says lead author, Dr Lawrence Haddad, executive director at the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).\n\nBad for you, bad for your country\n\nA poor diet may lead to type two diabetes, coronary heart disease, cancers, hypertension, anaemia and a whole range of other health issues, Haddad explains.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the growth in the rate of obesity among men is larger than that of undernourishment, and in Nigeria and Ethiopia diabetes is on the increase, the report shows.\n\nThis isn't just bad news for your health, it's bad for the economy, as poor public health can be a huge cost for governments.\n\nAcross Africa and Asia, the estimated impact of undernutrition on gross domestic product (GDP) is 11% every year, according to the report -- worse than the annual economic downturn caused by the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2010.\n\nIt's not just Africa -- rates of obesity and diet-related diseases such as diabetes are increasing all over the world, but they are growing fastest in countries with low GDP, according to the report.\n\nFrom underweight to obese\n\nBut that doesn't mean the end of starvation.\n\nIn Africa, due to large gaps in living standards, many countries are battling both undernourishment and obesity, according to the report.\n\nChildren are particularly vulnerable. An estimated 45.4% of deaths among children under five can be linked to poor diet. Foetal growth restriction, suboptimal breastfeeding, stunting, wasting and vitamin A and zinc deficiencies are all possible consequences.\n\nWhile undernutrition and hunger is slowly declining in Asia, in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of stunted children is still 58 million and rising by 500,000 every year, according to the report.\n\nIncome, a double-edged sword?\n\nWhile developing countries tend to see improvements in education and the reduction of poverty as incomes rise, more money doesn't automatically fix the problem, if people spend more on sugary drinks, street food, ready meals and other processed foods Haddad says.\n\n\"As income goes up, we can consume and buy more good things, healthier things like fruits, vegetables, fresh fish, stuff like that. But we can and do also buy unhealthy things -- processed meats, sugary drinks, highly processed food.\"\n\nIn Africa, urbanization has fueled a rise in processed food purchases, the report showed, especially in lower- and upper-middle-income countries.\n\nAmong the highest income group in urban areas of southern and eastern Africa, highly processed foods make up 65% of the average food basket, compared to 35% for this group in rural areas, according to the report.\n\nHaddad says processed foods are bad because they are full of calories, but may not leave you feeling full.\n\nThey may also be low in nutritional value.\n\n\"They have got lots of sugar, salt and saturated fats in them, and not a lot of anything else,\" Haddad says.\n\nDo cities make people fat?\n\nThe demand is driven by rapid urbanization, with people in cities leading busy lives and wanting convenience, Haddad says.\n\nOthers may live in slums without kitchens and buy all their food on the street or in cheap restaurants and cafes, he adds.\n\n\"Those kinds of places want to make their food tasty. They use unhealthy fats and lots of salt and sugar.\"\n\nPhotos: Why a Western diet could be bad for you The Western diet is spreading across the world.

This figure is expected to reach 70% by 2050.\n\nA third of the population obese by 2030?\n\nThe panel of experts and researchers in nutrition and global health presented the report to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation on 23 September, warning of huge health implications globally if people don't change their diets.\n\nBy 2030, the number of overweight and obese people will have grown from 1.3 billion in 2005, to 3.3 billion globally -- about a third of the population, the report estimates.\n\nPopulation growth is a major culprit.\n\nAfrica's population is the fastest growing in the world and is expected to account for more than half of the world's population growth between 2015 and 2050\n\nWhile predictions may look dire, Haddad says there are a number of things African countries can do to turn things around.\n\n\"It's not fate or destiny. There are choices.\"\n\nWhere does the money go?\n\nGrowing more protein rich foods such as beans could help, says Haddad\n\nFor example, countries should look at where research and development grants go, to promote foods with high nutritional value, he says.\n\n\"A lot of agricultural research and development money goes to increasing the yields of things like rice, maize and wheat.\"\n\nThis makes these crops cheaper and gives farmers a higher income, but while these foods are high in carbohydrates, they can be low in protein and other nutrients.\n\nJUST WATCHED Global wheat trade expected to grow massively Replay More Videos ...

They've got to put their foot on the accelerator. But then they've got to put their foot on the brake to stop the increase in ultra-processed food,\" he says.\n\n\"They've got to drive with both feet. It's not easy.\"",

    "text": "The British pound slumped to its lowest level in 31 years on Tuesday on fears that the U.K.'s divorce from the European Union will be bad for the economy.\n\nThe currency fell to just above $1.27, lower even than in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum on June 23, when Brits voted to take their country out of the 28-member group.\n\nBrexit plans have begun to emerge in the last few days: talks with the EU will begin in early 2017, the exit will happen two years later, and the U.K. will give priority to controlling immigration.\n\nEuropean leaders have made clear that if Britain does not allow free movement of EU citizens across its borders, it will lose some of its rights to access the free trade area.\n\nSo investors are worrying again about two big issues: British exporters may find it harder to compete in Europe, and the country's banks could lose the ability to do business freely across the region.\n\nThousands of financial firms in the U.K. currently have \"passports\" that allow them to trade in Europe without establishing subsidiaries in each country. And those businesses are vital for Britain: the financial and related services sector accounts for 12% of GDP.\n\nBloomberg reported Tuesday that Prime Minister Theresa May would \"refuse to prioritize\" the financial services industry in exit negotiations with the EU. Citing three anonymous government sources, Bloomberg said the sector held far less sway with May than with her predecessor David Cameron.\n\nRelated: Brexit exodus? Most big companies have thought about relocating\n\nInstead, May now appears to be putting control of Britain's borders first. Brexit campaigners had promised to impose new limits on the number of EU citizens entering the U.K.\n\n\"We voted to leave the European Union and become a fully independent, sovereign country,\" the Conservative leader told party members this weekend. \"We are not leaving the European Union today to give up control of immigration again.\"\n\nKit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, said that May appears to be treating immigration as \"the hardest of lines... [that] won't be sacrificed or watered down in order to keep access to the single market, particularly for financial services.\"\n\nSome investors fear that the strategy will result in a \"hard\" exit from the EU and years of pain for Britain.\n\nRelated: 100 days after Brexit vote: No meltdown (yet)\n\nThe U.K. economy has proved more resilient than expected in the wake of the EU referendum, but the sharp fall in the value of the pound and a big injection of money from the Bank of England have helped limit the fallout.\n\nTreasury chief Philip Hammond acknowledged Monday that the British economy would pay a price for Brexit.\n\nHe confirmed that a target to balance the budget by 2020 set by his predecessor would have to be abandoned -- a consequence of Brexit that will add to Britain's \u00a31 trillion-plus debt.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund added to the gloom on Tuesday, downgrading its July forecast for the U.K. economy. Even in the best case scenario, where fallout from Brexit is limited, the IMF predicts growth to slow to just 1.1% in 2017.\n\nThe pound has lost fallen than 15% over the past year, and is now trading way below its recent high of $1.71 set just two years ago. Analysts at UBS said the pain is far from over.\n\n\"In our view it is only a matter of time before less positive data starts to appear,\" they warned.",

They realize that there is a global market and appetite for big sports events,\" such as tennis, Formula One and soccer.\n\nThe event, owned by sports management and marketing agency Octagon, replaced Tokyo as one of the tour's Premier 5 -- a step down from the WTA's Premier Mandatory tournaments. It was leased for 15 years to the Wuhan Sports Development Investment Co.\n\nLast year, in an area that was far from developed three years ago, the Wuhan Open built a 1 billion yuan ($150 million) state-of-the-art center court, complete with retractable roof, modeled on the Australian Open. It can accommodate 15,000 tennis fans, as many as Wimbledon's showpiece arena.\n\nLi Na for @wuhanopentennis. Cute video. https://t.co/M9BrbCRfR7 \u2014 WTA Insider (@WTA_insider) May 27, 2016\n\n'New frontier'\n\nNone of it would have been possible without Li's victory at the 2011 French Open.\n\n\"It was the new frontier for tennis in China, a new era,\" Fabrice Chouquet, co-tournament director of the Wuhan Open, said in a phone interview. \"What was not possible before, became possible then.\"\n\n\"She has made tennis so popular in China,\" Chouquet said about Li, a two-time grand slam singles winner.\n\n\"It really has taken the game to the next level, at the level of basketball, and the national sports such as badminton and table tennis.\"\n\nEconomic powerhouse\n\nLocated at the convolution of the Yangtze and Han rivers in Hubei province, central China, Wuhan is using sports as a way to put itself on the map.\n\nHowever the city of 10 million played an important role in China's economic and cultural history and has a long track record as a trading hub due to its central location.\n\nWuhan is rapidly becoming an economic powerhouse that is outpacing national economic growth rates thanks to its fast-growing automotive industry -- Nissan, Honda and Peugeot Citroen all have joint ventures in Wuhan with Dongfeng Motor, title sponsor of the tournament -- high-tech industries and trade links.\n\nThe Wuhan Open, won by Venus Williams last year , is the first international top-level sports event held in the capital of Hubei. Wuhan is also home to the country's first college of tennis. Tennis is one of three sports -- soccer and swimming are the other two -- that are taught in local schools.\n\nVenus Williams will defend her Dongfeng Motor Wuhan Open title at the Optics Valley International Tennis Center.\n\n\"We want more tennis fans to come to tournaments, and want more companies to come to Wuhan,\" Yi Guoqing, Wuhan's other tournament director, said in an interview during the French Open in Paris in May.\n\nThe event attracted 75,000 fans in the inaugural edition of 2014, when it was won by two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. That year, however, Li retired from tennis on the eve of the tournament due to chronic knee injuries, two-time grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka withdrew due to injury and Serena Williams retired from her opener because of illness.\n\nAfter tripling the size of its 5,000-seat main stadium in 2015, it welcomed 120,000 visitors last year. Yi forecast 130,000 spectators in 2016.\n\nRevolution\n\nIn 1911, an uprising in Wuhan ended up overthrowing the Qing dynasty, ending imperial rule in China. More than a century later, the city is planning another big bang: turning itself into a mega-city cluster of 30 million people by 2025.\n\nDespite the rain our ball kids have had a great time experiencing #Paris and @rolandgarros \ud83c\udfbe #RolandGarros2016 pic.twitter.com/9V0AUoDGHw \u2014 Wuhan Open (@wuhanopentennis) June 2, 2016\n\n\"The city's tagline is 'Wuhan, different every day' and it literally is true,\" said Chouquet, a Frenchman who spends about half of the year in the city. \"Wuhan is growing, its economy is booming. It is transforming.\"\n\nChouquet pointed to the Optic Valley area where the Wuhan Open is located, which is \"a completely new city\" with a new hospital, hotels and subway all being built.\n\nFive years ago on the clay of Roland Garros, Li created a revolution of her own when she beat Italy's Francesca Schiavone to become the first Chinese player to win a grand slam singles title.\n\nLi's victory, which was watched by 116 million television viewers in China alone, turned her into a global star overnight and the world's second best-paid female athlete , according to Forbes. Known for her aggressive playing style on the court and humor off it, Li also took the 2014 Australian Open title and rose to No. 2 in the world.\n\nHailed as a \"pioneer\" by former WTA boss Stacey Allaster, Li played a pivotal role in boosting the development of the game in the world's most populous nation. The WTA hosts eight events in China, up from two in 2008.\n\nRetirement\n\nEarlier this year, Li became a global brand ambassador for the Wuhan Open, which flew the city's most famous resident to Paris for an event during the French Open in May.\n\nAfter playing tennis on a boat on the river Seine with fellow former French Open winner Mary Pierce, Li held a speech full of banter about her youth in Wuhan in front of an audience of French and Chinese dignitaries and dozens of members of the international press.\n\n\"Li Na in a way is a stronger brand than Wuhan to the western world,\" Shibli said. \"It may sound strange, because she is one person and they are a city of 10 million. She adds to the brand value of the event. It increases the appeal of the event and of the location.\"",

    "text": "They say that all that glitters isn't gold. But maybe that phrase needs to be changed? Gold hasn't done much glittering lately.\n\nThe price of gold fell below $1,300 an ounce earlier this week.\n\nIt's the first time the yellow metal has traded below that level since the Brexit vote in June shocked global markets. And some experts think that Donald Trump's recent woes may be a reason for gold's slump.\n\nYes, gold prices are still up 20% this year. But they have fallen more than 6% since hitting a 52-week high of nearly $1,365 an ounce in early July. Gold prices plunged 3% on Tuesday alone.\n\nShares of top gold miners such as Newmont (NEM), AngloGold Ashanti (AU) and Barrick Gold (ABX), have been hit even harder during the selloff. So have some wacky ETFs that make oversized bets on gold prices and mining stocks.\n\nAnd one ETF that shorts gold miners and has the ticker symbol of DUST (DUST) -- get it? -- is up nearly 50% this week.\n\nSo why are some investors predicting an end to this year's gold rush and heading for the exits?\n\nPresident Clinton isn't as good for gold as President Trump. Gold, like the broader stock market and the Mexican peso, has tended to rise (and fall) in tandem with Donald Trump's polling numbers.\n\nThe financial markets continue to view Trump warily. His unpredictable nature is scary. Remember that one of the key clich\u00e9s about Wall Street is that investors hate uncertainty. He's uncertainty with a capital U. Heck, he's ALL CAPS.\n\n\"We expect that [Trump's] policies will be inward looking and will weaken the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. In addition, his rhetoric and possibly policy actions could create domestic and international uncertainty at best, and upheaval at worst,\" said Georgette Boele, coordinator of currency and precious metals strategy at ABN Amro, in a report earlier this summer.\n\nRelated: Gold could soar if Trump beats Clinton\n\nShortly after Trump had his coronation moment at the Republican National Convention in August, some gold experts were even predicting that gold could get back to all-time highs above $1,900 an ounce from 2011 during a Trump presidency.\n\nTrump's momentum has started to fade though. And with it, so have gold prices. For the time being at least.\n\nThe election is still a month away so it would be foolish to count out Trump. Or gold.\n\nTo that end, it's worth noting that many gold miners have more than doubled this year though. The recent pullback could just be a correction and not the start of a long, bear market for gold.\n\nThen again, the Federal Reserve could kill the gold rally for good -- no matter who wins the race for the White House.\n\nRate hike + stronger dollar = bad for gold. The Fed has been hinting that a rate hike could be coming in December. Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester even suggested that the Fed could boost rates in November.\n\nMark my words, there is NO way the Fed moves days before the presidential election. But the president-elect is likely to be greeted with higher rates in December as long as the stock market and economy don't crater in the next few months.\n\nThat's not good for gold. Low rates have helped gold lately because investors had little reason to own U.S. bonds that yield next to nothing. If the Fed starts boosting rates, bonds suddenly become more attractive.\n\nRelated: Trump or Clinton? Stock market says the winner will be...\n\nThe dollar, which has strengthened against other currencies in recent weeks, could keep rallying too if rates climb. And that's bad for gold since many fans of the metal have flocked to gold due to fears that the value of the U.S. dollar would erode, not increase.\n\nStill, some think it would be a mistake to count out gold just yet. This could just be a blip. Many gold mining stocks have doubled this year, so the pullback may be just a healthy correction.\n\nIs this just a pause in gold's bull run? Gold prices could get a lift later this year as well due to demand from consumers in China and India.\n\nDespite concerns about China's economy slowing down, prices could spike ahead of next year's Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nAnd Diwali is just a few weeks away in India -- although demand for gold in India has waned lately even as India's economy is on fire. Some experts think Indian consumers may be investing more in stocks than gold. But that could quickly change.\n\nFinally, two famous investors -- bond kings Bill Gross of Janus and Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine -- continue to be big gold bulls.\n\nGundlach has been saying for months that gold could benefit from more turmoil in global financial system. He has specifically cited worries about the health of Deutsche Bank.\n\nRelated: Gold may be the biggest Brexit winner\n\nAlthough fears about Deutsche needing a bailout to deal with its legal fines in the U.S. are waning a bit, the Teutonic titan (and other European banks) aren't out of the woods yet.\n\nMeanwhile, Gross just wrote in his most recent monthly outlook that gold -- which he dubbed a \"historic relic\" should benefit from the fact that rates around the world remain low -- and in some cases, negative.\n\n\"At some point investors -- leery and indeed weary of receiving negative or near zero returns on their money, may at the margin desert the standard financial complex, for higher returning or better yet, less risky alternatives,\" Gross wrote.\n\nIn other words. Gross is not worried about a massive rate hiking spree by the Fed crushing the value of gold.",

    "text": "(CNN) That plane you're sitting on isn't an anonymous hunk of metal. It has a name, thank you very much.\n\nIt's named after a saint, or a star, or perhaps its city of birth. It might be named after a hashtag or a funny pun.\n\nNot all airlines name their aircraft, but those that do take the business (mostly) very seriously.\n\n\"In Hawaiian culture, the naming of a person, place or thing plays a significant role in defining its 'being' and giving it a spirit,\" explains Debbie Nakanelua-Richards, director of community relations at Hawaiian Airlines, which over the years has named its planes after constellations, native flowers and birds and, on one occasion, a Hawaiian sumo wrestler.\n\nWritten in the stars\n\nMost recently, the airline's A330s were named after star constellations used by Polynesian sailors (its first widebody A330 is called Makali'I, the Hawaiian name for the Pleiades cluster of stars).\n\n\"I was so taken by the idea of growth for our airline, and the idea that we were at the forefront of our next generation, I couldn't help but think about the universe,\" recalls Nakanelua-Richards, who had a hand in the A330 naming process.\n\nThe protocol for naming planes varies. Sometimes it's done by an individual, other times by a group.\n\n\"We had an employee with an extensive background in birdwatching that was very helpful when we were naming our first B717 aircraft,\" she says.\n\nConnecting flights\n\nEl Al looks to the map when naming its planes.\n\nDaniel Saadon, vice president and general manager at El Al -- Israel's national carrier -- says names act as a vital link between the company and the country it represents.\n\n\"El Al is very much connected to the land of Israel, so we found it nice to name our planes after the cities in Israel, just to show a connection to the people,\" he explains.\n\nPopular names for planes have included: Jerusalem, Sderot (a city close to the border of Gaza), and Rehovot (the birthplace of Chaim Weizmann, the first president of Israel).\n\nWhenever the airline chooses a new place to honor on a plane, there's an unveiling ceremony in the corresponding city.\n\nThe naming procedure is done by committee at El Al, which will probably meet up again soon, as the airline recently purchased 15 new planes.\n\nThe question is, are there enough Israeli cities to meet the needs?\n\n\"We are a small country, and we don't have hundreds of cities, so maybe we'll go into villages next, or we'll name them after people that had a lot of influence on Israel life, who knows?\"\n\nPlayful puns\n\nVirgin America has a less lofty approach when naming its planes, though the monikers are no less an expression of the company's brand.\n\nSome playful Virgin plane names include: An Airplane Named Desire, My Other Ride is a Spaceship, Scarlett O'Air, and Spruce Moose -- to name but a few.\n\nVirgin also has a varied approach to how it solicits names.\n\nSometimes it invites prominent figures to get in on the process, as it did in 2007 when Boing Boing co-editors and designer Jonathan Adler helped name 10 new planes added to the fleet (they came up with Unicorn Chaser).\n\nOther times, Virgin seeks the help of Facebook fans.\n\nPortlanders voted for Mount Hoodie -- a reference to Oregon's Mount Hood -- although I Liked This Plane Before It Went Mainstream was a close contender (a nod to Portland's hipster status).\n\nBack in 2011, Virgin America also unveiled the world's first plane named after a hashtag.\n\n#Nerdbird's moniker paid tribute to the tech-savvy customers the A320 served on routes to the United States' \"Silicon Cities.\"\n\nIrish airline Ryanair also used social media in 2015, when it celebrated the launch of its Facebook account -- yes, it really didn't have one before last year -- by running a competition for 30 lucky Facebook fans to get a plane named after them and their likeness painted on the side.\n\nSo how can you find out the name of the plane you're on?\n\nSimple. It's often right on the nose.\n\nAnd if you can't get enough of eccentric planes, take a look at this gallery of colorful airplane liveries from around the world.",

Well, guess what? Now over 150 countries have announced their targets for emissions reductions, including India. Now, they're not enough yet and - for - by anybody - we've all got to move more\u2026.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nFAREED ZAKARIA, HOST: Let me ask you about climate change, Mr. Secretary. You are embarking on a big push for the Paris summit. You gave a speech this week. In that speech, you were very eloquent in criticizing critics in the United States who are still skeptical about climate change.\n\nBut what do you say to those who say, look, that's all well and good, but the real skeptics, in a sense, are countries like India and Indonesia and, to an extent, even China, despite some changes, that still continue to use massive amounts of coal, emit huge amounts of carbon dioxide; and that whatever the United States or Western - or Europe may do, that's the real problem; and in those countries, they want to develop, they're not going to stop themselves from developing; the Paris treaty is not legally binding; so we will just cripple ourselves without doing much for climate change?\n\nJOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, Fareed, that's the challenge. And it doesn't make a lot of sense to develop and kill yourself as you do it. It - you know, we've learned lessons about the downsides of the way in which we have produced energy - electricity and power and transportation and so forth - over centuries now. And we have to move to a low-carbon economy, all of us.\n\nIf the United States, all by itself, tomorrow, were to drive, you know, carpool to work and bicycle to work and plant a bunch of trees and lower our emissions to zero, we can't solve the problem alone. India, China, every country in the world has to be part of it.\n\nNow that's why President Obama reached an agreement with President Xi - a ground-breaking, historic agreement - to join together to announce the intended emissions reductions that both countries would make as part of the Paris negotiations in hopes of inspiring other countries to do the same.\n\nWell, guess what? Now over 150 countries have announced their targets for emissions reductions, including India.\n\nNow, they're not enough yet and - for - by anybody - we've all got to move more. But if we come together in Paris - and I believe we can and hopefully will - to have an ambitious set of targets that we will all try to reach - not, you know - that we all agree to voluntarily try to reach - that will be an incredible signal to the marketplace, which already is seeing investment move into clean, alternative renewable different kinds of energy production. The solution to climate change is energy policy.\n\nSo it's a question of what choices we need to make in order to preserve our ability on this planet to produce food, to have water, to live where people live today without massive dislocations of human beings, without massive damage from intensified storms and wildfires and droughts, and all of the downsides that we're already beginning to measure.\n\nSo this is actually opportunity, not downside. And I think Paris will help define the full breadth of that opportunity. There\u2019s going to be trillions of dollars that will be invested in these new lower-carbon energy sources, and I think it's going - it can - has the chance of transforming everybody's economy for the better.\n\nZAKARIA: But Mr. Secretary, these countries are announcing these limits - none of it is legally binding, because the treaty is not legally binding.\n\nKERRY: Well, first of all, it's not a treaty, but it - there could be parts of it that are going to be legally binding. The targets themselves may not be. That, you know, is yet to be determined.\n\nI recently made a comment about this, and people said, well the whole thing is not going to be legally binding. That's not accurate. There could be parts of it - the transparency, the accountability, the further down the road - I mean, there are different things.\n\nAll of that has yet to be decided. That will be decided in Paris.\n\nZAKARIA: Mr. Secretary, pleasure to have you on, sir.\n\nKERRY: Thank you.\n\n### END ###",

That's why achieving the goal of ubiquitous and affordable Internet access is more important than ever.\n\nIn many cases, Internet access will grow naturally as increased demand and the economics of cheaper connectivity drive existing carriers and upstart providers to do more.\n\nBut we also have to find new ways to deliver data. Rather than relying on a single technical breakthrough, we'll need a combination of solutions, from mobile broadband and low-cost DIY infrastructure to far-out ideas such as drones and balloons.\n\nRead More",

When you destroy economies, when you are able to impose censorship on the world and especially the United States of America it's more than vandalism. It's a new form of warfare that we're involved in and we need to react and react vigorously, including reimposing sanctions that were lifted under the Bush administration, including other actions and that will squeeze them more economically and - but most of all, we have to really work together with the president and the Congress to come up with counters and abilities to respond, but more importantly to prevent.\u201d\n\nMcCain on President Obama\u2019s comments regarding Vladimir Putin: \u201cI think that it's bizarre to think that any action on the part of the President of the United States has proved any deterrence to Vladimir Putin. We won't even give defensive weapons to the Ukrainians. We - President Obama - and we should be thanking the Saudis, who have allowed the value of a barrel of oil to go to the point where it's affecting dramatically Vladimir Putin's economy.

    "text": "Laurie Garrett is a Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) Thirty-five years ago, alert physicians in the United States spotted a new disease, caused by a virus that had been in circulation, unnoticed, for decades in people, and millennia in monkeys.\n\nThe virus had hit pay dirt, racing through the gay sexual revolution where one man might have sex with 30 other men a year, giving the virus exponential rates of infection\n\nOver time, the virus' transmission shifted, especially in Africa, from rare cases of monkey-to-human transmission to general heterosexual spread, with women today five times more likely to be newly infected compared to men, thanks to sexual cultures that favor male promiscuity.\n\nThat was HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which currently infects more than 37 million people living all over the world.\n\nA key lesson of AIDS is that a virus\u2014in HIV's case, infecting African monkeys\u2014might pass rarely, but repeatedly, to human beings for decades before arriving in a context of epidemic potential.\n\nAdapting to new modes of transmission and targeting novel species, the microbe can exist for thousands of years before beginning to achieve previously unimaginable feats, with devastating impact.\n\nNow the world is facing a virus that seems poised to make a similar leap: the Zika virus.\n\nLike HIV, Zika originated in central Africa, very rarely infecting human beings, and circulating among rainforest primates. Unlike HIV, Zika had the ability to fly, carried by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from one monkey or human, to another.\n\nSince reaching Brazil in 2013, where it has spread explosively over the last 12 months, Zika has demonstrated capabilities not seen, or extremely rarely noted, with any other insect-carried microbes.\n\nMost worrying, Zika has shed its mosquito transport dependency, becoming an efficient resident of human semen , and spread from male-to-female (and male-to-male) via sexual intercourse.\n\nThis week researchers reported finding Zika in a woman's vagina, noting that, \"the very presence in the female genital tract [implies] that sexual transmission from women to men could occur.\" And barely had the ink dried on that report when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced today that a woman who traveled in a Zika-hit country, who got infected through a mosquito bite, has passed the virus onto her male sexual partner in New York City, marking the first documented case of female to male sexual transmission in the U.S. (and the 14th documented sexual transmission in the U.S. overall).\n\nIf Zika finds its way into an especially sexually active community, it could well become a threat not only in America's southern, mosquito-infested states, but anywhere in the world.\n\nLike HIV, the Zika virus would likely find its way into populations that feel discriminated against by the general population, and take its toll disproportionately among teenage girls and young women.\n\nAnd while politicians play partisan games with funding on Capitol Hill, government and philanthropic donors ignore the World Health Organization's pleas for a measly $122 million to fight it, and state health agencies scramble to find anti-mosquito resources, the virus is spreading in new ways , causing an ever-widening range of dangerous birth defects and human illnesses.\n\n\"I am concerned that the goose is cooked. This funding is done. It's not coming to us,\" Dr. Umair Shah, a public health official in Harris Country, Texas told NBC News . \"We cannot spray our way out of this situation,\" Shah added, saying pesticides won't be enough to stop Zika at this late date in the American South.\n\nJUST WATCHED What twins can tell us about Zika Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What twins can tell us about Zika 03:14\n\nThe lingering Ebola epidemic in West Africa offers lessons on the difficulty of stopping a virus that takes on sexual transmission and can abide in semen for weeks after a man has recovered from the disease. Several times in 2015 and 2016, Ebola seemed to have been eradicated from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia, only to reemerge via sexual transmission\n\nThe statistics on Zika as a sexually transmitted disease are sobering. According to the World Health Organization , the Zika virus has emerged in 48 countries since Brazil sounded the alarm in October 2015.\n\nFour of those countries have active mosquito-borne spread of the virus underway now, and eleven of them\u2014including the United States\u2014have documented sexual transmission of the virus. Two Americans have died of Zika , one in Puerto Rico and the other in Utah. They were among the 1,132 travel-related Zika cases documented in the United States. Among the 50 states, Florida has been hardest hit to date, with 263 confirmed cases, 43 of them pregnant women, followed by Texas.\n\nPolitics should not trump biology\n\n\"No pregnant women should have to worry that her baby will develop brain damage because she was bitten once by a mosquito,\" a petition to Congress from the March of Dimes states. \"It's an outrage that Congress has failed to give states and localities the resources they need to protect pregnant women and babies from Zika virus.\"\n\nThe Zika funding stalemate on Capitol Hill might well result in an increase in the numbers of abortions in the United States this year\u2014an ironic and tragic outcome of a political squabble that features, among other disputes, Democrats' objection to House Republicans' inclusion of anti-Planned Parenthood language in the GOP's Zika bill\n\nIn Latin American countries hard hit by the virus, abortion rates have soared this year by as much as 108%, which research suggests is due largely to women who feared carrying a \"Zika baby\" but had no access to tests that could confirm the healthy viability of their fetus. Such tests don't exist: American women have no special advantage in the Zika fight, despite the greater wealth of the United States.\n\nIn a few days, the Republican Party will gather for its national convention in Cleveland, Ohio\u2014a metropolis that last year ranked in the top twenty most mosquito-infested cities in the United States. At the end of this week, Congress will shut down for the summer, and the politicians will not return to hammer out new agreements until September 6.\n\nBarring a remarkable compromise, the politicians will exit Washington on Friday, leaving funding for Zika prevention and research in the lurch , with the White House, Senate, and House each offering radically different funding proposals, none of which will materialize as money for research.\n\nMeanwhile, in all tiers of public health across America, scientists and officials are scrambling to rob other budgets in order to finance research and mosquito control measures. At local levels, this ironically means things like sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) programs are losing money, so that counties can hire mosquito abatement experts.\n\nAt the federal level, the remaining Ebola programs are seeing their budgets pilfered to provide temporary Zika funds, and a range of basic science research initiatives at the National Institutes of Health are on hold , their funds diverted to efforts to understand, diagnose, treat and vaccinate against Zika.\n\nVital questions about Zika, especially as a sexually transmitted disease linked to birth defects, are going unanswered, thanks to the research funding gap.\n\nCan the world's blood supply be cleansed of Zika risk with transfusion?\n\nHow likely is it that sexual transmission could dominate spread of Zika in the United States?\n\nHow long can Zika survive in semen and cause infections?\n\nHow does the virus get through the placenta to infect the developing fetus?\n\nIs it possible to create a 100% reliable fetal test for Zika infection and brain damage that can be used to guide decisions regarding pregnancy termination?\n\nAre the risks greater in a particular stage of pregnancy?\n\nWhy aren't sonograms reliably identifying microcephaly babies in utero?\n\nCan a mother give birth to Zika-damaged babies if she never had symptoms of the disease?\n\nAre there ways that women can protect themselves and carry babies to term, short of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to delay pregnancies altogether?\n\nHow can a potential Zika vaccine be safely tested on pregnant women and their babies\n\nIn the absence of answers to these and other Zika questions, women are compelled to make dire decisions, including opting for abortions\n\nIs Zika becoming a sexually transmitted disease?\n\nWhile HIV and Ebola offer potential roadmaps for how this might happen, it's still an open question. Researchers in Brazil took a deep dive into the country's data for dengue, a virus spread by the same Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as carry Zika, analyzing of the disease's diagnoses in 2013, 2015, and early 2016.\n\nThey paid special attention to the distribution of dengue by age and gender. And they did the same for Zika cases in the country over 2015 and 2016. If all Zika cases were due to mosquito bites, the demographic distribution of dengue and Zika should match. But that's not what they found\n\nInstead, 90% more Zika cases were registered among women, compared to the female rates for dengue.\n\nNeighboring Colombia has also seen far more Zika in females, with young women accounting for two-thirds of the 65,726 cases diagnosed by mid-April 2016.\n\nResearchers note that though the infection rate was similar in very young children of both genders, \"the incidence was significantly higher among female patients than among male patients in all other age groups.\"\n\nCritics charge that both the Brazilian and Colombian studies may simply reflect the greater fear women have about exposure to Zika during pregnancy, prompting more of them to seek medical care. The researchers disagree, insisting that the higher rates of diagnosed Zika are seen in young women, whether or not they are pregnant or are trying to conceive.\n\nOne reason young women may be at higher risk is that they are having more sex with male partners whose semen may remain Zika-contaminated and infectious for months\n\nSuch a pronounced gender difference wasn't seen in the Zika outbreaks in Pacific Island nations between 1990 and 2013, but there have been subtle genetic changes in the virus since its arrival in the Americas. Are these mutations relevant to sexual transmission? That is another research question scientists would like to answer, if Congress ever provides funding.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mothers of Zika babies shunned by society Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mothers of Zika babies shunned by society 02:13\n\nAt the end of June, frustrated scientists at the NIH decided to charge ahead with pregnancy and sexual research, despite congressional gridlock, by putting numerous other disease studies on temporary hold.\n\nA large study, tracking women over time in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, has begun enrolling volunteers. \"We are going out on a limb, but we have to,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters . \"We can't say we're going to wait until we get all the money.\"\n\nWhen microbes gain capacity to be sexually transmitted, they rarely disappear from the human population group in which they emerged.\n\nIn 2008, for instance, physicians in San Francisco noticed that drug-resistant Staphylococcus, MRSA, was far more prevalent among gay men compared to any other demographic group; the bacterial disease had become a STD , soon surfacing among gay men in Boston and New York.\n\nIn 2013, European researchers discovered that a virulent form of the bacterium that causes meningitis was spreading sexually among gay men. By 2015, gay men were dying from the new STD, and this year, public health officials all over the United States are begging gay men to get vaccinated as meningitis outbreaks surface nationwide.\n\nHow to prevent a sexually transmitted Zika catastrophe?\n\nSo what can we do to stave off a similarly catastrophic turn of events with the Zika virus? According to the CDC , 287 pregnant women living in the United States were diagnosed as Zika-infected by June 23, and another 250 in U.S. territories. There is no reliable test that can tell these 537 women whether or not the virus has passed to their fetus, gnawing away at their tiny, developing brains. In the United States and beyond, women especially are in desperate need of such a test.\n\nA recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans have heard of Zika, which means an alarming third of the population knows nothing about the disease, and is unlikely to take precautions against infection.\n\nFewer still\u2014less than half\u2014were aware that Zika could be passed sexually. In the absence of such knowledge, sexually active Americans are unlikely to use condoms.\n\nAround the world, intriguing puzzles abound. Jacqueline Silva de Oliveira lives in Santos, Brazil, where she contracted Zika during her pregnancy\u2014either via a mosquito or sexually, it is not known\u2014and gave birth to twins in February.\n\nToday, Lucas is a healthy, happy infant, but his twin sister, Laura, suffers in agonizing pain thanks to Zika microcephaly -- which slaughters brain cells and results in complete remodeling of the brain in development.\n\nThe Brazilian government is monitoring six such sets of twins , discordant for Zika microcephaly, in hopes of learning how the virus infects (or doesn't infect) fetuses.\n\nIn France , a healthy couple trying to have children sought in vitro fertilization. The clinic assisting them tested their blood and his semen for various infections, including Zika: they were fine.\n\nThe couple took a holiday in the Caribbean nation of Martinique, returned to France, and underwent more tests. The man's blood was free of Zika, but about a month after they were back in France, the woman became infected. Examination of her partner's semen revealed Zika. Neither of them ever had symptoms of illness, nor felt any reason to avoid sex or use condoms, as they were a married couple trying to have a baby.\n\nHere at home, time is running out. Researchers desperately need funding to provide the tools required to forestall a sexually transmitted Zika epidemic in the United States.\n\nIn the absence of those tools, women will make difficult choices, deferring pregnancies for months, perhaps years, and seeking abortions.\n\nThe stalemate on Capitol Hill may actually increase the likelihood that more American babies will be born with terrible malformations and neurological deficits. And, equally horribly, that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of couples will seek abortions based on suspicion of Zika infection, possibly terminating some healthy pregnancies.",

The US continues to seek his return on charges of espionage and theft of government property.\n\nSnowden is clearly grateful for the hospitality he was shown.

    "text": "(CNN) Photographer Niki Boon and her husband, Rob, decided to home-school their four children when they moved to a rural region of New Zealand five years ago.\n\nBut sitting around the table and learning didn't go quite the way they expected.\n\nThe children resisted, so Niki and Rob switched to a more relaxed approach. Instead of following a fixed and rigid curriculum, each child explores his or her curiosities on the family's 10-acre property in Blenheim, surrounded by waters and bushes and hills.\n\nThis decision was quite controversial among family and friends.\n\n\"We got lots of questions from people about how this is going to work, and were (my children) actually going to learn anything,\" Boon said. \"I don't really like the term 'unschooling,' it's such a negative term. They're not really unschooling. They're not 'un-' anything. They're just learning a little differently than in a standard school.\"\n\nPhotographer Niki Boon\n\nThe former physiotherapist started making photographs as a record, she says, to show family and friends what her children were doing during the day.\n\nAt first, her images were mere snapshots that were neither capturing the true story of what they were doing nor conveying what it truly felt like to be doing certain activities.\n\nThat's when Boon began studying photography, so she could represent her children's lives better. Her photo series \"Wild and Free\" is a dreamy black-and-white glimpse into a childhood spent among nature and the environment.\n\n\"We spend so much time outside, and I want the kids to know that the world is theirs and that they're free within it,\" she said. \"We've got a rural property, so they run wild and free and it's something I try to capture in the pictures -- that this is their childhood.\"\n\nWe spend so much time outside, and I want the kids to know that the world is theirs and that they're free within it. Photographer Niki Boon\n\nThe photographer's decision to raise her children this way actually stems from a form of education named after Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher. Steiner established what's known as anthroposophy, a spiritual philosophy that says human beings can optimize their physical and mental health using mainly natural means.\n\nBoon's eldest son, Kurt, is now 13 years old and spent a year at a Rudolf Steiner school when his family lived in a different district. He was 6 at the time, and the school did not have computers and encouraged families not to have TVs, Boon says.\n\n\"We embraced this completely and fully and we loved the idea so much,\" she said. \"We got rid of our TV, and we haven't had one since.\"\n\nKurt, Rebecca, Anton and Arwen not only don't watch TV, but they don't use any kind of modern electronic devices, either -- no computers, no smartphones.\n\n\"It's not that we don't want them to have any access to it, it's just not our first line of investigation of anything that needs to be found out,\" Boon said. \"We prefer them to find their answers to their questions either out in nature or in books.\"\n\nBut Boon acknowledges that this probably won't be the case forever. She says her children haven't shown interest in using any kind of technologies yet -- but if any of them were to start developing an interest, she and her husband would look into it at that stage.\n\n\"It doesn't appear to have put them at any disadvantage at this point,\" Boon said, referring to her children's electronic-free life. \"We don't have any opinions on anyone else; each to their own. Everybody chooses what they believe is best for their children. Our children seem pretty happy and OK so far. I know that'll change and that's OK, but we just want them to start this way.\"\n\nA modern technology her children are clearly exposed to, however, is the camera. Boon shoots with a Canon 5D Mark III and 35-millimeter lens. Her children aren't all that interested in what she's making with it, though.\n\nSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\n\n\"They live in the minute,\" Boon said. \"They don't want to know what happened yesterday or what happened even that morning. They just want to know what's happening now.\"\n\nBoon draws inspiration from some of the greats -- Eve Arnold, Eli Reed, Eugene Richards -- and one motivation behind her photography has to do with her own childhood: her mother passed away when she was in her late teens.\n\n\"It's now as a mother myself that I would love to go back and ask her about my childhood,\" Boon said. \"But she's not here to tell the stories. I don't have the stories to pass on to my children, and the photos are so limited that I wish there were so, so many more. And that's something that I want to pass on to my kids if something ever happened to me -- and one day it will. They'd have those stories, and they can pass them on as well. I think it's really important.\"\n\nPerhaps with time, Boon's children will recognize the significance of their mother's photographs. But for now, it's all about living in the moment and learning from the moment, swinging from trees and sliding in mud.",

Without fail, he comes back in what scientists believe is a sense of loyalty to a man who rescued him when he was at his worst.\n\nYou may be familiar with the story of the two friends that captured the hearts of many.\n\nPereira de Souza took him under his wing and nurtured him back to health, thoroughly cleaning oil residue on the penguin's body and feeding him for days until he was fit enough to return to the water. Despite his attempt to set him free, the penguin returns every year to his home.\n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Krajewski, a biologist and wildlife presenter at Globo TV, was the first to document the story of Dindim and the man who saved his life.\n\nIn an email to CNN, Krajewski said that after all these years, this two-legged survivor returns annually and stays on the island when other penguins of his species are breeding.\n\n\"We absolutely don't know where Dindim goes and this remains a mystery,\" he told CNN.\n\nIn March, scientists tagged the penguin to find out more about his origins and trajectory. \"For the first time, we have definite proof that it is the same penguin returning to Mr. Jo\u00e3o's house, since he came back with the tag.\"\n\nThere have been a lot of misinterpretation about the life of this penguin, including the myth that Dindim is kept as a pet.\n\n\"First of all, the penguin is completely free,\" Krajewski said in a Facebook post. \"It sleeps in Mr. Jo\u00e3o's backyard, which is connected to the beach and only partially fenced, since Jo\u00e3o is concerned about street dogs attacking the penguin.\"\n\nAnd while the idea of a penguin returning to visit every year seems surreal, Krajewski said that most Magellanic penguins are \"very loyal to their partner and nesting site. They nest in the same place every year and with the same partner, he said.\n\n\"Nothing in nature is 100%, but this would be a rule for penguins, and they recognize each other by their sounds,\" he said. \"Dindim definitely knows where he is going when he arrives at Ilha Grande, since for four consecutive years he goes, by himself, to the very same spot on Mr. Jo\u00e3o's backyard.\"\n\nThe retiree has become part of Dindim's family.\n\nKrajewski says his most memorable moment covering their friendship was witnessing Dindim's bill gently touching Pereira de Souza's face, as if cleaning him. \"This shows how close they are and how comfortable Dindim is around Mr. Jo\u00e3o,\" he said.",

We wanted to take control of the end,\" he said.\n\nThe engineer said he would miss the mission, especially the public enthusiasm for Rosetta but added: \"The legacy will be there for many generations.\"\n\n'Astonishing' mission\n\nAstronomer Dan Brown, who lectures at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, said the Rosetta mission had been an \"astonishing\" engineering feat but also inspirational.\n\n\"The Rosetta mission has helped us gain an insight into the activity of comets, how comets were created and to some extent if they could have been the source for water on our early Earth,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"The presence of complex molecules, some of which previously unknown to exist on comets, still allows comets to be a possible source of introducing complex molecules and enable the formation of life on Earth.\n\n\"The image that does it for me is seeing the surface of the comet and the lander together. Such imagery inspires as much as the Moon landings and drives us to go and discover, achieve and face challenges on our never-ending quest for knowledge.\"\n\nThe end of the mission also brings to a close the Twitter chat that has endeared followers to Rosetta and Philae, and their surreal and strangely touching conversations, especially when the landing craft bounced and disappeared.\n\nAsked if he would change anything, O'Rourke said: \"Philae couldn't have been designed better than it was ... but I think I would have added LEDs that flash so it could have been detected wherever it landed.\"",

    "text": "What's the best investing and withdrawal strategy to provide me a retirement income that will last 30 years? --Matt\n\nClearly, the way you invest your savings and the amount you withdraw each year are both important in determining how long your retirement assets will last.\n\nInvest too aggressively and your nest egg might suffer losses so devastating during a major downturn or a prolonged bear market that it might not recover enough to generate sufficient income even after stock prices rebound. Invest too conservatively and your retirement portfolio may not generate enough capital growth for you to maintain your standard of living in the face of inflation over the course of a long retirement.\n\nThe same applies to withdrawals. Pull too much from your savings, especially early in retirement, and you increase the risk that you may run out of money while you've still got a lot of living to do. Being more cautious about how much you withdraw can reduce that risk, but it exposes you to another risk -- namely, you could end up with a big pile of savings very late in life. That might not seem like such a bad thing, but it might mean that you lived more frugally than you had to early in retirement.\n\nSo a good retirement income plan must achieve a balance between how you invest your money and how much you withdraw. That said, when it comes to making sure that you don't outlive your savings, I contend that how much you pull from savings each year is actually the more important of the two. Which means you want to take special care in setting an appropriate withdrawal rate.\n\nTo see why that's the case, let's look at a few scenarios involving different investing strategies and withdrawal rates.\n\nRelated: How much will I need for retirement?\n\nAssume you're 65, have a $500,000 nest egg, 60% of which is invested in stocks and 40% in bonds. And let's further assume that you want to be reasonably sure that your nest egg will be able to support you for 30 years, or until age 95. If you withdraw 4%, or $20,000, the first year of retirement and then increase that dollar amount by inflation each year -- that is, you follow the 4% rule -- T. Rowe Price's retirement income calculator estimates there's an 80% chance your nest egg will be able to maintain that inflation-adjusted income stream for at least 30 years without running dry.\n\nYou would think that investing more aggressively or conservatively might dramatically increase or decrease your success rate, but that's not necessarily the case. Indeed, for stock allocations from as high as 100% to as low as 30%, the chance of a $500,000 nest egg being able to sustain a $20,000 income -- real or inflation-adjusted -- for 30 or more years range between 76% and 80%. Not a big difference.\n\nIt's only when you get to very low exposures to stocks -- less than 30% of savings -- that the success rate begins to drop off significantly at a 4% withdrawal rate.\n\nAnd contrary to what you might expect, very high stock allocations (80% to 100% in stocks) actually had a slightly lower chance of success than more modest stock allocations (40% to 60%), largely because at some point adding more stocks makes a portfolio much more volatile and vulnerable to market setbacks.\n\nAnd if you go to a lower initial withdrawal rate -- say, 3% -- you'll also find that boosting your stock exposure doesn't do much to increase your success rate, and high allocations to stock (70% or more) begin to pull your success rate down.\n\nIn fact, it's only when you get to withdrawal rates of 5% or more that lofty stock holdings appreciably boost your chances of success. For example, a nest egg invested in a mix of 60% stocks-40% bonds has about a 55% chance of lasting 30 or more years at a 5% withdrawal rate. Going with a much more aggressive 90% stocks-10% bonds mix will boost your chances of success to just under 60%.\n\nBut the question is whether you would consider that rate of success acceptable, as it also means you have a greater than 40% chance that you'll run through your nest egg too soon. In short, you shouldn't expect that an aggressive investing strategy will support outsize withdrawals from your savings.\n\nRelated: How to tell if you're on track to a secure retirement\n\nThe upshot: As long as you set a reasonable withdrawal rate -- say, 3% to 4% -- you should have pretty wide latitude for how you divvy up your savings between stocks and bonds. Which means you can likely create a stocks-bonds mix that largely jibes with your tolerance for risk without putting you in too much danger of running through your nest egg too soon.\n\nFor guidance on how to build such a portfolio, check out this risk tolerance-asset allocation questionnaire.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that these success rates aren't guarantees. They're estimates based on how the financial markets might perform in the future. So you should be prepared to be flexible about withdrawals, lowering them if your nest egg's value takes a hit and perhaps increasing them if outsize gains in your investments causes your retirement account balances to swell.\n\nIf you'd like the peace of mind from knowing you'll receive a payout every month regardless of how the financial markets perform, you can consider putting some (but not all) of your savings into an immediate annuity or a longevity annuity and keeping the rest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.\n\nRemember too that the success rates above measure only the likelihood that your savings will last a specific amount of time, in this case 30 or more years. They say nothing about how much money you may have left in your retirement accounts in those scenarios when they don't run dry. And the fact is that in those instances where your savings do last 30 or more years, a higher stock stake can leave you with a much bigger nest egg late in retirement.\n\nSo even if greater stock exposure doesn't increase the chance that your portfolio will last longer, you might still prefer to tilt your asset mix more toward stocks if, say, you want to leave more money to your heirs or just want to have a bigger cushion to handle higher-than-anticipated medical expenses or other unexpected expenses late in life. Just don't forget that investing more heavily in stocks also increases the potential for gut-wrenching drops in the value of your savings during periods of market turbulence.\n\nYou can see for yourself how different mixes of stocks and bonds and withdrawal rates affect your nest egg's longevity by going to the T. Rowe Price calculator I used in the examples above or by using this retirement withdrawal calculator from the American Institute for Economic Research. If you go through this exercise, I think you'll find that if you want greater assurance that your nest egg will last as long as you do, your primary focus should be on choosing a reasonable withdrawal rate.",

To put that in perspective, America's highest paid all-male act, Maroon 5, made $33.5 million.\n\nBig Bang's label YG Entertainment reports that their latest world tour \"MADE\" was attended by 1.5 million people, and the group jointly hold the most number 1 singles on Billboard's World Digital Songs Chart with their label mate PSY.\n\nThe K-pop story\n\nThe Big Bang story began 10 years ago, when YG Entertainment -- founded in 1997 by one of the first K-pop stars, Yang Hyun-suk -- asked five of its promising trainees to form a boy band.\n\nK-pop began in South Korea in the early 90s, and labels such as YG built the nation's pop industry from the ground up, creating a training scheme that applies the same rigor Koreans approach academic life with to the entertainment industry.\n\nYoung aspiring stars are offered sometimes decade-long contracts, which essentially induct them into K-pop boarding schools; there they sleep, eat, drink and spend around 12 hours a day training for fame.\n\nBig Bang perform at the K-Collection in Seoul in 2012.\n\nMobile phones, the internet and romantic relationships, if the rumors are to be believed, are forbidden.\n\n\"[The training] was quite harsh,\" Daesung, who has also released solo material, tells Talk Asia . \"But, to some level, I think you have to have the fundamentals right in the beginning ... so even though I was worried, I also think that kind of system has a lot of advantages, as well.\"\n\nIndeed, while K-pop is notorious for producing highly manufactured bubblegum groups, Big Bang have been praised for their individuality and ability to fuse a pop sound with rap, RnB and dance elements.\n\nOf those years spent training, G-Dragon says: \"I don't think of it as a sacrifice, but more as an investment.\"\n\nBig Bang set to implode?\n\nThat investment has certainly paid off.\n\nThe group has become one of the most successful acts in the hallyu wave -- the name given to phenomenon of the rise of Korean entertainment worldwide -- an industry that is worth $4.8 million, according to the Korean Trade Investment Promotion Agency.\n\nJUST WATCHED How big is Big Bang?

Justin Timberlake's springboard band, *NSync, for example, lasted seven years, while British quintet One Direction went on an indefinite hiatus after five years.\n\nBig Bang say their secret to longevity is good chemistry.\n\n\"We are the happiest when us five are together, that kind of relationship is the reason that makes us last longer,\" frontman G-Dragon tells CNN.\n\nTaeyang adds: \"We normally tell each other right away when we don't like something. So we don't hide such negative feelings, don't let it grow ... I think that's the biggest secret to lasting for 10 years\".\n\nThe landmark anniversary was marked by an exhibition in Seoul, documenting their career, celebratory concerts and the release of a documentary-style film.\n\nBig Bang about to implode?\n\nBut at what is perhaps the height of their fame -- they've made seven studio albums -- the group are facing a huge hurdle.\n\nUnder South Korean law, men over the age of 18 must be conscripted for at least 21 months into the military before the age of 35 -- it's considered a rite of passage.\n\nWhile some are exempted for medical reasons, it's a huge taboo in South Korea to skirt this duty; for celebrities, doing so could have a severe impact on their careers. Although it should be noted PSY had a wrangle with the government about serving his military service, which appears not to have held back his global success.\n\nJUST WATCHED Inside the world of a K-pop superstar Replay More Videos ...

    "text": "Generation X has a gripe with pulse takers, zeitgeist keepers and population counters. We keep squeezing them out of the frame.\n\nThis overlooked generation currently ranges in age from 34 to 49, which may be one reason they\u2019re so often missing from stories about demographic, social and political change. They\u2019re smack in the middle innings of life, which tend to be short on drama and scant of theme.\n\nBut there are other explanations that have nothing to do with their stage of the life cycle.\n\nGen Xers are bookended by two much larger generations \u2013 the Baby Boomers ahead and the Millennials behind \u2013 that are strikingly different from one another. And in most of the ways we take stock of generations \u2013 their racial and ethnic makeup; their political, social and religious values; their economic and educational circumstances; their technology usage \u2013 Gen Xers are a low-slung, straight-line bridge between two noisy behemoths.\n\nThe charts below tell the tale.\n\nTo be fair, there are a few metrics that don\u2019t fit this straightforward pattern of generational evolution. For example, over the course of their voting lives, older Gen Xers have tended to be more Republican than both older Boomers and younger Millennials. Also, Xers are more pessimistic than both of those larger generations that they\u2019ll have enough money for their retirement \u2013 though some of that negativity is doubtless tied to the economic stresses of middle age.\n\nGen Xers also stand out in another way. In 2010 when Pew Research asked adults of all ages if they thought their own generation was unique, about six-in-ten Boomers and Millennials said yes. But only about half of Gen Xers said the same. And even among those who did, there was very little consensus about why they are distinctive.\n\nOne reason Xers have trouble defining their own generational persona could be that they\u2019ve rarely been doted on by the media. By contrast, Baby Boomers have been a source of media fascination from the get-go (witness their name). And Millennials, the \u201ceverybody-gets-a-trophy\u201d generation, have been the subject of endless stories about their racial diversity, their political and social liberalism, their voracious technology use, and their grim economic circumstances.\n\nGen Xers have also gotten the short end of basic generational arithmetic. Due partly to their parents\u2019 relatively low fertility rates, there are fewer of them (65 million) than Boomers (77 million) or Millennials (an estimated 83 million assuming a roughly 20-year age span and including those who have yet to reach adulthood).\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason that Xers are a small generation: They\u2019ve been deemed to span just 16 years, while most generations are credited with lasting for about 20 years. How come? No one really knows. Generational boundaries are fuzzy, arbitrary and culture-driven. Once fixed by the mysterious forces of the zeitgeist, they tend to firm up over time.\n\nOne final slight: Even their name is a retread. World War II photographer Robert Capa first coined the term Generation X in a photo essay about the young adults of the 1950s, but the label didn\u2019t stick the first time around. It was revived thirty years later by Canadian author Douglas Coupland, whose coming of age novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, was set in Southern California.\n\nFor Xers, there\u2019s one silver lining in all this. From everything we know about them, they\u2019re savvy, skeptical and self-reliant; they\u2019re not into preening or pampering, and they just might not give much of a hoot what others think of them. Or whether others think of them at all.\n\nPaul Taylor, executive vice president for special projects at the Pew Research Center, is the author of The Next America: Boomers, Millennials and the Looming Generational Showdown (Public Affairs, 2014). In other words, he\u2019s part of the problem.\n\nTopics: Demographics, Generations and Age, Political Attitudes and Values",

    "text": "Companies in Britain may soon be forced to reveal the number of foreign workers on their payroll.\n\nThe U.K. government is considering the measure as part of a broad review of immigration policy aimed at reducing the number of people coming to Britain.\n\nImmigration has been running way ahead of government targets for years. Fears about the impact on jobs, wages, housing and public services were a factor in the June vote to take Britain out of the European Union. (EU citizens are free to live and work in any of the union's 28 member countries.)\n\nU.K. unemployment is at an 11-year low of just 4.9%, a fact acknowledged by the government's top official for security and immigration, Amber Rudd.\n\nBut she said changes were needed to ensure that migrants are \"filling gaps in the labor market, and not taking jobs that British people could do.\"\n\nRelated: Brexit exodus? Most big companies have thought about relocating\n\nRudd's comments, delivered at the Conservative Party conference, came on the same day that the British pound hit a new 31-year low on fears the country was heading for a \"hard\" separation from the EU.\n\nThe government's attitude toward immigration is at the heart of investor concerns. European leaders have made clear that if Britain does not allow free movement of EU citizens across its borders, it will lose some of its rights to access the vast free trade area.\n\nThe suggestion that companies should list foreign workers drew an angry rebuke from London mayor Sadiq Khan, the leader of a city where roughly 40% of the population was born outside the U.K.\n\nThis sends a deeply worrying message to the millions of people from around the world living & contributing in our country. #LondonIsOpen pic.twitter.com/19vXkDIUel \u2014 Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) October 5, 2016\n\nRudd defended the proposal, describing it as \"one of the things we're going to look at.\"\n\n\"It's not something we're definitely going to do, it's one of the tools we're going to use as a review [and] a way of nudging people to better behavior,\" she said during a radio interview on Wednesday.\n\nOther potential measures include tighter restrictions on student visas, and changes that would raise the burden of proof on companies who say they need to hire foreigners because British workers lack the required skills.\n\nRelated: Will Britain's European workers get the boot?\n\nThe government declined to provide details about the immigration policy review, and instead directed inquiries to the Conservative Party. Officials there did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAbout 3 million EU-born migrants live in the U.K., according to the Oxford Migration Observatory. About 1.9 million of them -- or 63% -- are working. That's a higher proportion than the population as a whole.\n\nIt's not just EU citizens coming to Britain. In 2014, nearly 70,000 workers came to the U.K. from outside the union.\n\nSome immigrants, such as Bank of England chief Mark Carney, even hold positions at the heart of government. Carney is a citizen of Canada.",

He is set up with his own table and chairs, power banks and a supply of water.\n\nHe means business, quite literally.\n\nWith four devices on the go at once, he advertises his Pokemon GO-playing service for $18 (25 SGD) an hour.\n\nIt's just one of the ways in which creative individuals have found ways to make money from a game that has become a worldwide phenomenon since its launch earlier this year.\n\nFull-time player\n\n\"Me doing this is actually just to have some fun, because if I were to play just one account, I feel bored,\" Tan tells CNN against a soundtrack of beeps and chirps from four simultaneous games.\n\nHe apologizes for not making eye contact; he needs to keep his eyes on the screens because he has a pair of clients to play for on top of his own two accounts.\n\nAn avid gamer, the 25-year-old used to work in an insurance firm, but he quit in 2015 when he discovered he could earn money from making YouTube videos of himself playing Clash of Clans, another popular smartphone game.\n\nNow he says he doesn't even have time to edit his videos -- which feature a running commentary -- because he's too busy playing Pokemon GO from 6pm to 6am, seven days a week.\n\nHe's been approached by up to 26 clients since he started offering his services playing Pokemon GO in August. It's earned him around $2,200 (3,000 SGD) so far, but Tan says money wasn't his main motivation.\n\n\"I wanted to show people how I play games. Not many people believe how I play,\" he says.\n\nSince offering to play Pokemon GO for free would trigger a deluge of requests, Tan decided to set a price. \"I only have two hands and could probably play only a maximum of five accounts, not 50!\"\n\nProfessional hunters\n\nTan is far from being the only Pokemon GO pro.\n\n39-year-old Jeremy Chin is a civil servant by day and a rare Pokemon collector by night.\n\nHe proudly shows CNN his collection of rare animated monsters caught with the help of third-party radar maps and Twitter accounts that provide tips on where rare Pokemon are spawning.\n\nPokemon GO's creators, Niantic Labs, have been shutting down third-party apps like the maps Chin uses, saying that these external parties affect their \"ability to deliver the game to new and existing players.\"\n\nNot that he is dissuaded.\n\n\"I get to see the sights of Singapore, where I have not gone before,\" he says of his hunting experience. \"I also take it as a form of exercise.

He hires others -- through private connections he did not disclose -- to play the game, before selling Level 30 accounts on for about $18 (25 SGD) each. He says he's already sold about 300 accounts, both to Singaporean and international players.\n\nCan Niantic beat the cheats?\n\nNiantic Labs chief executive John Hanke told Forbes in July that he was \"not a fan\" of third-party apps like radar maps.\n\nPro players operate multiple accounts at once\n\n\"People are only hurting themselves because it takes some fun out of the game. People are hacking around trying to take data out of our system,\" he said.\n\nAnd in August, the developer said it was done with cheaters.\n\nIn a firmly worded blog post , Niantic said it would continue to terminate any accounts that showed signs of cheating. \"After reviewing many reports of in-game cheating, we have started taking action against players taking unfair advantage of and abusing Pokemon GO,\" the company said.\n\nA quick search online however turns up numerous sellers of Pokemon GO accounts that tout high levels and rare Pokemon.\n\nIt's against the rules, but PoGo Pirate doesn't think there's much developers like Niantic can do.\n\nHe says the practice existed long before Pokemon GO came on the scene.\n\n\"They will never be able to police the sales -- there's always a way around it.\"",

Subscribe to the \"2 degrees\" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\n\nHumans never have lived on a planet that's 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels, in the late 1800s, and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2-degree mark.\n\n\"This is gambling with the planet,\" said Gernot Wagner , the lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of the book \"Climate Shock.\"\n\nThink super droughts, rising seas and mass extinctions.\n\nYet for all of its importance, I don't think the 2-degree threshold is as famous as it should be. I've heard it referred to as the \"north star\" for climate negotiations. Meaning: This one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world's attention.\n\nIt's so significant that it's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year. I'm calling that effort \"2 degrees,\" and I need your help to make it work.\n\nUntil 5 p.m. ET Monday, you can vote on the first story I'll report for the series.\n\nTell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees Posted by CNN on Tuesday, April 21, 2015\n\nAll of those story ideas came from you, by the way.\n\nThey focus on what a 2-degree world might look like.\n\nCNN kicked off this effort with a Facebook chat last week. We asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2-degree threshold, specifically.\n\nI don't have all the answers right now. We'll continue to explore the importance of this number together. But below you'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number. Many of them come straight from you, the readers. And I tossed in a couple of my own.\n\nIf you'd like to follow this project as it evolves, I'd encourage you to sign up for the \"2 degrees\" newsletter . And feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below. They'll shape the way I spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number.\n\n1. Where did the idea for 2 degrees come from?\n\nOne guy, it turns out. William Nordhaus , an economist at Yale.\n\nNordhaus, 73, proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 (1977!) paper titled \" Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem .\"\n\nThe estimate was \"crude, but it was a reasonable first start,\" he told me.\n\n\"If there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years,\" he wrote in \"The Climate Casino.\"\n\nA growing body of research now supports the idea.\n\n2. How did 2 degrees become the international standard?\n\nScience has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming. And that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want.\n\n\"You need a judgment call for these things,\" said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, who has written on the history of 2 degrees Celsius. \"And this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy.\"\n\nGermany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal, Jaeger told me. That happened in the 1990s. Later came the European Commission , the G8 , the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most significantly, the Copenhagen Accord , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much.\n\nThe United States was among the signatories\n\n3. What would the world look like at 2 degrees?\n\nI'm going to spend the month of May exploring this question, so look for more on this. But here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like. These are pulled from reports by the National Research Council , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Bank\n\n\n\n\u2022 Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.\n\n\u2022 A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates\n\n\u2022 The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.\n\n\u2022 Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.\n\n\u2022 The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%. \u2022 Wildfires in the United States are expected to increase 400% to 800% in size.\u2022 Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.\u2022 A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates 20% to 30% of animals and plants species will be at \"increasingly high risk of extinction\" at or near the 2-degree mark.\u2022 The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.\u2022 Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.\u2022 The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%.\n\nSo ... not good.\n\nAnd numbers don't convey the emotional toll.\n\n\"I'm from New Mexico,\" said Nordhaus, the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold. \"I love it there, and I know it's going to be a completely different climate. The trout fishing probably won't be as good. The hiking won't be as good. These forests may look completely different, or burn down. I love to ski. It's one of my things I love most. And that's obviously affected by warming. I love the ocean, and the New England coastline, and it's in peril. That's just for starters.\"\n\n4. What happens at 2.1 degrees?\n\nNo one knows, exactly. Think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking. How many cigarettes give you cancer? No one knows, exactly. But the more you smoke, the more you up your risk. And 2 degrees, policy experts agree, is certainly risky territory.\n\nPlus, everyone hates a fraction.\n\nTargeting 1 degree of warming is \"ridiculous because you can't do it,\" said Nordhaus, the economist. \"Three sounds too high. And you can't have a fraction because it's too complicated.\n\n\"So two is kind of an obvious number.\"\n\n5. How much has the climate warmed already?\n\nThe climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the Industrial Revolution . And we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we're already putting into the atmosphere, even with \"very ambitious mitigation action\" to reduce carbon emissions, according to a 2014 report from the World Bank. Some of that warming is \"locked-in to the Earth's atmospheric system,\" that organization says. The impacts of climate change already are being felt.\n\n6. Is it possible to stay below 2 degrees?\n\nYes, but it won't be easy.\n\n\"If you want to stay below 2 degrees, you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree,\" said Jaeger from the Global Climate Forum.\n\nHere's the best guess for what that \"amazing speed\" might need to look like: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80% to 90% by 2050, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. \"It depends on how much risk you want to accept,\" she said. Some activists, including those from 350.org and Avaaz, which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in New York , want to accept less risk than that.\n\n\"Our position is 100% clean energy,\" said David Sievers, a senior campaigner for Avaaz.\n\n7. What happens if we don't take action?\n\nSome writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target, saying it's too ambitious, or even naive. But we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that \"north star\" to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem.\n\nIf you think 2 degrees sounds bad, 5 degrees is far, far worse.\n\nThe IPCC expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by \"major extinctions around the globe\" and a \"reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide.\" Just beyond that, at 6 degrees, we're looking a \"catastro-f***\" that would be almost \"infinitely costly,\" said Wagner, the Environmental Defense Fund economist. \"It's akin to killing the planet, basically. Or society on the planet.\"\n\nThis much should be clear: Something has to change.\n\nIf we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3, that's still better (or less awful) than 5 or 6. What's important is that we maintain a sense of urgency, and keep sight of the goal.\n\nPhotos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Melting polar ice caps \u2013 The consequences of climate change go far beyond warming temperatures, which scientists say are melting the polar ice caps and raising sea levels. Click through the gallery for a look at 10 other key effects of climate change, some of which may surprise you. Hide Caption 1 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Drought \u2013 In the coming decades climate change will unleash megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, according to a new report by scholars at Cornell University, the University of Arizona and the U.S. Geological Survey. We're seeing hints of this already in many arid parts of the world and even in California, which has been rationing water amid record drought. In this 2012 photo, a man places his hand on parched soil in the Greater Upper Nile region of northeastern South Sudan. Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Wildfires \u2013 There's not a direct link between climate change and wildfires, exactly. But many scientists believe the increase in wildfires in the Western United States is partly the result of tinder-dry forests parched by warming temperatures. This photo shows a wildfire as it approaches the shore of Bass Lake, California, in mid-September. Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Coral reefs \u2013 Scientists say the oceans' temperatures have risen by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last century. It doesn't sound like much, but it's been enough to affect the fragile ecosystems of coral reefs, which have been bleaching and dying off in recent decades.

Invasive species such as the bark beetle, which thrive in warmer temperatures, have attacked trees across the North American west, from Mexico to the Yukon. Climate change has not been kind to the world'sforests. Invasive species such as the bark beetle, which thrive in warmer temperatures, have attacked trees across the North American west, from Mexico to the Yukon. University of Colorado researchers have found that some populations of mountain pine beetles now produce two generations per year, dramatically boosting the bugs' threat to lodgepole and ponderosa pines. In this 2009 photo, dead spruces of the Yukon's Alsek River valley attest to the devastation wrought by the beetles.

One, this golden toad of Costa Rica and other Central American countries, has already gone extinct.

Scholars from the University of East Anglia found that Icelandic black-tailed godwits have advanced their migration by two weeks over the past two decades. Researchers also have found that many species are migrating to higher elevations as temperatures climb.

    "text": "For $1,500, you could fly away for the weekend, spend a night or two in a nice hotel and have a fancy dinner. Or you could buy one share of Priceline. But only one.\n\nPriceline (PCLN, Tech30) hit a new all-time high of above $1,500 on Wednesday. That makes it the priciest stock in the S&P 500.\n\nPriceline stock is now up nearly 20% this year. The company is worth nearly $75 billion.\n\nTo put that in perspective, it's three times as valuable as leading airline Southwest (LUV) and nearly five times higher than the market value of Marriott (MAR).\n\nPriceline is worth more than twice as much as buzzy unicorn Airbnb too, and its market value is four times higher than rival Expedia (EXPE).\n\nIn other words, Priceline is the king of the travel industry. Not bad for a company that was in danger of going under during the big dot-com bust 16 years ago. (Remember when Al Gore and George W. Bush were running for president? How quaint.)\n\nPriceline has come a long way from being a quirky site that let you name your own price for airline tickets. In fact, it quietly killed off that gimmicky feature last month.\n\nWilliam Shatner's Priceline Negotiator character is no longer a star of the company's TV commercials either. Thankfully, Shatner is still present though. He's just the voiceover narrator now. (Don't short the Shat!)\n\nPriceline now owns six big travel and leisure related online brands.\n\nThere's the namesake site of course. But it also owns Booking.com, which is huge in Europe and expanding aggressively in the U.S., hotel reservations site Agoda, travel search engine Kayak, restaurant reservation service OpenTable and Rentalcars.com.\n\nThis diverse lineup of brands has served the company well.\n\nFears about a slowing global economy -- particularly turmoil in Europe due to Brexit and worries about China -- briefly dented Priceline's stock earlier this year. But it's quickly recovered.\n\nThe company also didn't suffer from the surprise resignation of CEO Darren Huston in April after it was revealed that he had an extramarital affair with a female employee.\n\nRelated: Priceline CEO out after sexual relationship with co-worker\n\nThe company's revenue and earnings have continued to grow at a healthy clip. Wall Street is predicting profit increases of about 16% a year for the foreseeable future as well.\n\nAnd despite that, the stock still trades at a reasonable valuation of about 19 times 2017 earnings estimates.\n\nBut what about that sticker-shock inducing price? Some investors aren't exactly willing to just spend hundreds of dollars on the market, let alone $1,500 for one share.\n\nInvestors shouldn't hold their breath waiting for the company to split its stock in order to push the price down though.\n\nCompanies occasionally will issue more shares to existing shareholders in order to lower the share price. The value doesn't change. If Priceline split its shares 5 for 1, for example, investors would have 5 shares worth $300 instead of one at $1,500.\n\nBut Priceline has only split its stock once. And it was a reverse split ... a move where companies cut the number of shares to prop up the price. Priceline did that in 2003 -- when investors were worried about the company's survival.\n\nThe move ensured that Priceline wouldn't become a penny stock. If that happened, it could have been delisted from the Nasdaq. Big mutual fund investors could have been forced to sell the stock as well.\n\nThat obviously didn't happen. Priceline is now one of the most successful tech companies out there.\n\nAnd even though the price of one share may seem insanely high, the company clearly hasn't had a problem finding new buyers.\n\nThe same can be said for two other tech giants. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) each cost more than $800 a share. And like Priceline, those two stocks are near all-time highs.",

    "text": "(CNN) Flint, Michigan, is dealing with another outbreak . This time it's an infectious bacterial disease called Shigellosis , which can cause bloody diarrhea and fever and typically spreads when people don't wash their hands.\n\nThat's exactly what's happening in Flint, the county health director told CNN.\n\nA water crisis has plagued residents there for more than two years. Last year, people experienced rashes and hair loss when high levels of lead were found in the local water supply. In 2014, the area faced one of the worst outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease in US history.\n\nStill afraid and mistrustful of the water, people in Flint -- who are still forced to use either filtered or bottled water because of damaged water pipes -- are bathing less, and refusing to wash their hands.\n\n\"People aren't bathing because they're scared,\" said Jim Henry, Genesee County's environmental health supervisor. \"Some people have mentioned that they're not going to expose their children to the water again.\"\n\nInstead, he said, people in Flint rely on baby wipes, which they can get for free at bottled water distribution centers.\n\n\"But baby wipes are not effective, they're not chlorinated, it doesn't kill the bacteria and it doesn't replace handwashing,\" Henry said. \"People have changed their behavior regarding personal hygiene. They're scared.\"\n\nShigellosis is caused by the Shigella bacteria, and its symptoms include fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration. Symptoms usually resolve after five to seven days without antibiotic treatment, but it is very contagious, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . There are about 500,000 cases in the United States every year.\n\nHighest numbers in the state\n\nData from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services obtained by CNN shows that Genesee County -- home to Flint -- has the most cases of Shigellosis in the entire state. The county with the second-highest number of cases is Saginaw County, which borders Genesee and is home to many people who commute into Flint for work.\n\nOf the 84 cases so far this year in Genesee County, at least 53 are in the Flint city limits, said Henry, who tracks and investigates disease in the county. At least 27 were hospitalized.\n\n\"It's very easy to transmit person to person, or through food. If people aren't washing their hands, it runs through the whole county,\" Henry said, adding that he attributes cases even outside of Flint to the water, since there is contact between people who live in and outside the city.\n\nCounty health records shared with CNN show that Shigellosis cases spiked in Genesee County in June 2016, peaking at about five times the number cases seen at any period since October 2011.\n\nAnd, since the water crisis, there has been a steady increase of cases, especially in children. The youngest person diagnosed was 17 months old.\n\nSeveral residents who talked to CNN said they are afraid of touching or using the water because so many got rashes in 2014 and 2015 when the state insisted that the water was safe to use.\n\n\"With the kids, we use baby wipes,\" said Delano Whidbee, a Flint father of two young girls. The Whidbees have tried to limit exposure, even though they have filters on their shower and faucets.\n\nAnother resident told CNN he travels to a relative's home every day -- outside the city limits -- to take a shower.\n\nHot water kills germs, but Henry said, \"people are not running hot water through the filters,\" out of fear it will decrease the life of the filter, and it's contributing to the spread of disease.\n\nMarc Edwards, the Virginia Tech researcher who helped expose the Flint water crisis, told CNN that people can switch off their filters when running hot water.\n\nDid the state drop the ball again?\n\nThe CDC, state and county are now working to fight the spread of Shigellosis. Henry said he's been pushing a \"wash your hands\" campaign\n\nBut initially, he said, he struggled to get information and cooperation from the state department of health. When he alerted it to the high number of cases in August, Henry said the state health department told him to \"contact the CDC,\" which he did.\n\n\"During the time that MDHHS refused to communicate with us regarding Shigellosis, we had several more cases, which MDHHS knew about because they are reported\" in the state system, Henry said. Eventually, in September, the state health department began working with the county and CDC on Shigellosis and other diseases, he said.\n\n\"However, for weeks the state MDHHS stopped communicating and assisting [the county] regarding all disease investigations, including Shigellosis,\" he added. \"This action directly compromised the safety and health of our communities.\"\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA spokeswoman for the MDHHS said in a statement that it worked with the county on Shigellosis starting in May. It limited communication during a two-week period in August because of a protective order issued by the courts as part of the ongoing investigation into the Flint water crisis and the role the department is playing in it. It resumed information and assistance to the county at the end of August, it said.\n\nA statement provided to CNN said, \"It is entirely irresponsible ... to attempt to portray MDHHS's efforts regarding the Genesee County shigellosis situation as somehow lacking. MDHHS has been fully engaged in this effort.\"",

The main stadium court has a retractable roof and is big as Wimbledon's Centre Court with space for 15,000 tennis fans.\n\nMillion dollar question\n\n\"The ambition to find the next Li Na is very big,\" Jorge Salkeld, senior vice president of the tennis division of Octagon which owns the Wuhan Open, said in an interview at the event.\n\nAlthough absent from the Wuhan Open because she is about to give birth to her second child, Li's presence looms large in the city of Wuhan, which has invested $225 million in a 33-acre tennis facility.\n\nLarge advertising billboards promoting the Wuhan Open with Li, a tennis racket flung over her shoulder, are plastered all over this booming city of 10 million. Inside the tennis stadium, large photographs of Li adorn the walls.\n\n\"The next grand slam winner from China, that's the million dollar question,\" said Salkeld, who spends about five months of the year in China.\n\n\"But they're coming. My prediction is that in five, six, seven years you are going to have 10 girls in the top 100. They are working hard, there is the volume and there is the funds behind it.\"\n\nLi Na collapses in delight after winning the French Open in 2011.\n\nAspirational sport\n\nTennis is so popular in central Hubei province, the Wuhan Open received 5,000 applications from university students for 800 volunteering jobs during the event.\n\nMeanwhile on the court 15 million people now play tennis in China, according to the International Tennis Federation, up from one million in 1988.\n\nWhile table tennis is easily accessible to the masses because it's cheap, tennis is very much an aspirational sport for China's emerging middle class with disposable income. For example, it will cost $3 an hour to rent a table tennis court for an hour in Beijing, compared to $15 for a tennis court.\n\nThe Wuhan Open aims to promote Chinese tennis to the same level as table tennis and badminton -- sports at which China has traditionally dominated.\n\nHowever, with a population of 1.3 billion, competition in China is strong and playing sports \"is a way for many families to have their kids do something important,\" said Salkeld.\n\nLi joined the state-sponsored sports system in Wuhan when she was aged five. It was so rigid, she would occasionally cry herself to sleep at night.\n\n\"From the age of 11, I'd be hearing a coach behind me yelling, 'Stupid,' or 'Are you a pig?'\" Li wrote in her autobiography \"Playing Myself.\"\n\nAfter the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese Tennis Association (CTA) relaxed some of its strict rules and allowed a few older players -- including Li and former US Open semifinalist Peng Shuai -- to set their own tournament schedules and choose their own coaches.\n\nInstead of handing over 65% of all earnings, they were allowed to keep about 90% of it but would have to pay for their travel and coach.\n\nIt is perhaps no surprise all three Chinese women ranked inside the top 100 -- Zhang, 70th-ranked Wang Qiang and 79th-ranked Zheng Saisai - all hail from the municipality of Tianjin in northeastern China.\n\nSaisai Zheng lost in the first round of the Wuhan Open.\n\n'Good environment'\n\nThe Tianjin system gives players more flexibility than in other areas in China in the way they train and which coaches they can use.\n\n\"Everybody is really positive, we cheer for each other,\" said Zheng, China's third-highest ranked player who is coached by former Italian pro Roberto Antonini. \"Whoever has a good result, we support. This is a really good environment.\"\n\nZheng, 22, was one of five Chinese players handed a wild card by Wuhan Open organizers.\n\nThe 27-year-old Zhang, the daughter of a soccer player father and basketball player mother, is having a breakthrough year. Having never won a grand slam singles match before, she reached the Australian Open quarterfinals as a qualifier a few months after contemplating retirement.\n\nPhotos: China's tennis ambition Photos: China's tennis ambition The Wuhan Open in Hubei province, central China, has spent 1.5 billion yuan ($225 million) on its facilities since its inception in 2014.

A few years ago, we didn't have the chance to play big tournaments at home.\n\n\"Now we are very lucky to get some wild cards.

It also has more than 620 volunteers, who have become a support system for those often stigmatized by the broader community.\n\n\"We're not trying to treat anything. We're trying to be really empathetic listeners,\" Marchesi said.\n\nSince 2014, his nonprofit has provided more than 300,000 pounds of clean laundry to Aussies \"sleeping rough\" in 12 cities across the continent.\n\nThe group plans to expand to the United States next year.\n\nCNN's Marissa Calhoun spoke with Marchesi about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\n\nCNN: What inspired you to start your mobile laundry service?\n\nNicholas Marchesi: It started out as a fun idea by my best mate, Lucas (Patchett), and me -- to do something to make a difference in our community one weekend. We quickly realized that we'd stumbled upon something that was totally a scalable idea.\n\nLucas and I, we're really passionate about finding ways to give back. Today, we're a massive operation that is growing fast, and it's really having a significant impact on communities. We're so blessed with people from all around the world who are supporting us.\n\nCNN: People who experience homelessness face many challenges. Why did you choose this focus?\n\nMarchesi: I took for granted having fresh, clean clothes -- but when you think about it, this is a very important issue. Constantly being damp, constantly being dirty, that can have a massive impact on someone's life.\n\nNot only can we eliminate diseases that can be transferred through dirt or soiled clothing, but we're able to restore respect. We even found a way through our service to employ some of our homeless friends.\n\nJUST WATCHED How the 'rolling suds machine' works Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How the 'rolling suds machine' works 01:51\n\nOrange Sky Laundry isn't the cure to cancer. It is not a multi-million dollar operation. But (it) is a really simple way to treat others the way they deserve to be treated. I couldn't think of anything better to be doing in my life right now than finding a way to help people improve their lives. It's something that gives me fuel each day.\n\nCNN: What happens during a wash?\n\nMarchesi: Clean clothes and conversation is really at the heart of what Orange Sky Laundry does. When the washing's in the machine, there's absolutely nothing to do except sit down and have a chat.\n\nThe most important thing our vans carry are six orange chairs. Those chairs help our volunteers foster positive and genuine discussion. And each and every minute that those chairs are in use, our service is improving the lives of our homeless friends.\n\nCNN: Who designed the Orange Sky Laundry vans?\n\nMarchesi: Every van we build ourselves, and that means we know it inside and out. They take us two to three days to build. In each van, we've got two washing machines, two dryers, two water tanks and a generator onboard. We can wash and dry clothes anywhere. After the vans are built, we trial them, and eventually they are sent to a service area to be put to use.\n\nWe're incredibly curious people, so we try to be creative as we develop newer models -- and through that creativity and innovation, we've found new ways to do things. We've made it easier for our volunteers to operate the vans. We've made it safer for them to operate, but also we've made it more fun.\n\nWe hope to one day have Orange Sky Laundry vans operating all around the world that are having the same impact.\n\nWant to get involved?

    "text": "(CNN) Actor Ben Stiller revealed on Tuesday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014. The tumor was surgically removed three months later, in September 2014, and Stiller has been cancer-free since.\n\nAccording to Stiller, it was the prostate-specific antigen test, a blood test known as the PSA, that saved his life. He was tested and treated in his 40s.\n\nBut the American Cancer Society recommends testing start at age 50 for men such as Stiller, who are at average risk of prostate cancer. Men at high risk, including African-American men and those with a father, son or brother diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age should be screened at age 45, the American Cancer Society recommends.\n\n\"This is a complicated issue, and an evolving one,\" Stiller wrote, acknowledging that there's differing advice about when -- or if -- to take the test. \"But in this imperfect world, I believe the best way to determine a course of action for the most treatable, yet deadly cancer, is to detect it early.\"\n\nAre early PSA tests better?\n\nStiller's doctor offered to give him a \"baseline\" PSA test when Stiller was about 46, according to his post. PSA tests measure how much prostate-specific antigen substance is being produced by the prostate, and if the levels are high, it could be a sign of prostate cancer.\n\nMost men are not tested until they are older, around 50, but Stiller agreed to the baseline test.\n\n\"I have no history of prostate cancer in my family and I am not in the high-risk group, being neither -- to the best of my knowledge -- of African or Scandinavian ancestry. I had no symptoms,\" Stiller wrote. \"What I had -- and I'm healthy today because of it -- was a thoughtful internist who felt like I was around the age to start checking my PSA level, and discussed it with me.\"\n\nOver the next year and a half, Kruger continued to monitor Stiller's PSA levels, testing the actor every six months. When his levels continued to rise, Stiller was sent by Kruger to be examined by a urologist, who then ordered him to have an MRI screening of his prostrate.\n\nWhen the results came back, the news was blunt: \"So yeah, it's cancer,\" the urologist told Stiller.\n\nProstate cancer is the second-most common cancer in men in the United States, after skin cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute, and is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in men. Prostate cancer usually grows slowly, the institute notes, and it often has no early symptoms. \"Finding and treating prostate cancer before symptoms occur may not improve health or help you live longer,\" the National Cancer Institute said\n\nStiller was told that the disease was detected early and was treatable, he wrote. He underwent a biopsy of his prostate, which revealed he had \"mid-range aggressive cancer.\" The best option for Stiller was to get rid of the tumor through surgery. Edward Schaeffer performed a robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, successfully removing the cancer.\n\n\"If he had waited, as the American Cancer Society recommends, until I was 50, I would not have known I had a growing tumor until two years after I got treated,\" Stiller wrote.\n\n\"If he had followed the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, I would have never gotten tested at all, and not have known I had cancer until it was way too late to treat successfully.\"\n\nThe case for delaying prostate cancer screening\n\nThe American Cancer Society supports PSA testing, but it warns there are downsides to testing.\n\n\"The thing Ben Stiller doesn't understand is that his case is based on one positive experience,\" said Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"He hasn't heard of all of the men who have had negative experiences [with PSA testing].\"\n\nThe society suggests that men who are 50 or older should weigh the harms and benefits of PSA testing, discuss their views with a doctor, and may choose to get tested. Men who are at \"high risk\" for developing prostate cancer -- those who have a family history of cancer, or are African-American, for example -- may opt for PSA testing earlier, some when they are as young as 40. Some men never choose to get screened.\n\nWhile Stiller sheds a good light on PSA testing, Brawley warns about the risks of the tests.\n\n\"The tests have bad operating systems,\" Brawley said. \"They sometimes miss cancer that needs to be found, and they find cancer that doesn't need to be found.\"\n\nAs a result of a misleading PSA tests, men may be diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated unnecessarily, leaving them vulnerable to health risks associated with biopsies and surgery.\n\nWhen men's PSA levels are tested before they are 50, there may be more chance of error in testing, Brawley said. The average age of men diagnosed with prostate cancer is 67, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nAlong with the physical stress of undergoing screenings, tests and biopsies -- a test \"as invasive as it gets: long needles in sensitive places,\" Stiller wrote -- there are psychological stresses involved with PSA testing. Being confronted with the numbers on a regular basis, especially if they are rising, may cause depression and even suicidal thoughts in men, Brawley says.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nInstead of arguing for or against PSA screening, Brawley says he wants a better prostate cancer detection test.\n\nHe hopes that the public will read Ben Stiller's report conscientiously, rather than pushing for testing without considering the consequences.\n\n\"The bottom line is, there's more harm associated with prostate cancer screenings than good,\" Brawley said.",

    "text": "Edward Lucas is a senior editor at The Economist, where he was the Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. He has covered Central and Eastern Europe for more than 20 years. The opinions expressed in this article belong to the author.\n\n(CNN) Mitt Romney was right. In 2012, the then-Republican presidential contender attracted derision by dubbing Russia America's \"No. 1 geopolitical foe.\" Russia has indeed gone from being a regional nuisance to a global adversary of the United States. And right now it looks as though it is winning.\n\nTrue, the Putin regime has failed to modernize or diversify the economy . The political system is a farce piled on a tragedy -- as this weekend's sham parliamentary elections will demonstrate. Russia is a pipsqueak when it comes to gross domestic product, innovation or culture. (Donald Trump: Please call your fact checkers.) But no other country poses such a threat.\n\nWe used to think Russia was no military menace. Then came the war with Georgia in 2008. Then we said it could attack only small countries. It invaded Ukraine in 2014. Then we said it could not project military power beyond its borders. In 2015, it stormed back to the Middle East , checkmating the West in Syria by keeping the Assad regime in power and pulverizing the opposition.\n\nWorse, Russia has exploited the borderless Internet and globalized media to take the fight to the heart of the West. The most notable target is the American presidential contest. Only two years ago the suggestion that the FBI and CIA would be investigating Russian intelligence operations aimed at disrupting the world's most important election would have seemed like the delusions of a failed Hollywood scriptwriter.\n\nNow, according to The Washington Post , such an investigation is indeed underway. Attributing cyberattacks is hard. But all the signs point to Russian state involvement in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's computer network and of Colin Powell's emails.\n\nThe release of such information plays into a big weakness in our media and politics: prurient excitement about other people's private communications. It should be no surprise that Democratic Party chiefs preferred Hillary Clinton to her left-field challenger, Bernie Sanders -- which the DNC hack \"revealed.\" Powell thinks that Clinton is greedy . Wow. Most Americans think that, too.\n\nYet revealing these \"secrets\" creates a frisson of excitement. It feeds into many Americans' feeling that the political elite is hypocritical. And it is excellent news for Donald Trump, the candidate who portrays himself as an outsider.\n\nThese attacks cannot be traced definitely back to the Russian government, but similar games have been played elsewhere -- and to the Kremlin's advantage. The selective release of a bugged conversation between Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the American ambassador during her visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, in 2014 made the United States look meddling and arrogant.\n\nEmails from Gen. Philip Breedlove, then NATO's top military commander, showed he was \"plotting\" -- to use the term favored by the Intercept website -- to \"escalate military tensions\" in Europe. In fact he was doing what senior generals do: bouncing ideas off friends and allies, and working out how to make his case best to the White House.\n\nBut the combination of hacking and leaking has proved effective on other fronts, too. Russia was furious when the World Anti-Doping Agency exposed a huge state-sponsored effort to give Russian athletes an unfair advantage. Now the agency's computers have been breached, and private medical data about athletes have been published. The aim is to show that the agency was selective: Western athletes take banned substances, too, on flimsy-sounding medical grounds.\n\nJUST WATCHED WADA president: Russian hackers not helping Russia Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WADA president: Russian hackers not helping Russia 03:36\n\nThese charges may be quite baseless or exaggerated, but the damage is done. The aim of that operation was probably to bolster the Kremlin's standing at home, underlining the Putin regime's overall propaganda narrative: that the West is hypocritical and hostile.\n\nRussia, in short, is a formidable adversary. It can do what the West can't: accept economic pain (brushing off sanctions), use force (as in Syria) and ruthlessly exploit the weaknesses of a free society -- our careless ways with computers and our gullibility about the sources of information we read online.\n\nFew stop to ask who is behind DCLeaks , for example, the mysterious \"whistleblowing\" site that acts as such a convenient repository for stolen material? Questions also surround WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange . When did these campaigners for transparency ever publish material that embarrasses the Kremlin?\n\nThe paradox here is that the West is falling victim to just the tactics that its critics mistakenly ascribe to it. Edward Snowden says that his leak of National Security Agency documents was motivated by the fear of an Orwellian nightmare in which the authorities would use digital means to control society and eliminate opposition\n\nAs our democracy and our alliances crumble, that nightmare is indeed taking shape before our eyes.",

In New York this season Tom Ford , Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren all showed instantly shoppable collections.\n\nWhat would Worth make of the change? In his day the upper echelons of Parisian, and then American, society were ushered into private salons four times a year to view his designs.\n\nNeither time nor gender could stop Woolf's story and it seems the same now applies to Bailey.\n\nThe format was simple and soon widely adhered to -- the shows would begin with day wear and end with evening wear and, of course, the wedding gown. They were elite, exclusive and it took months for the public to see any of the designs shown behind these tightly closed doors.\n\nGuests mingle pre-show.\n\nRead More",

I was pretty depressed,\" the Kansas City resident admits . \"No guy who has kids feels good about not being able to take care of them.\"\n\nBut the distinctive technique Stutzman initially mastered to hunt has catapulted him to worldwide fame.\n\nThe 33-year-old holds the Guinness World Record for archery's farthest accurate shot , hitting the target with no more than his feet and shoulders from 283.47m away to take the record previously held by an able-bodied competitor.\n\nMatt Stutzman (@armlessarcher) competes in #Archery tomorrow @ 10am GMT-3.\n\n\n\nEnjoy this video while you wait. pic.twitter.com/4oBQTautaw \u2014 Rio 2016 (@Rio2016_en) September 13, 2016\n\nA silver medalist in London four years ago, Stutzman bowed out in the last eight this time around -- losing to Brazil's Andre Muniz de Castro by a single point (141-142).\n\nBut, beyond the bullseyes, this Paralympian defies the odds every time he picks up his bow.\n\nMemorable moments\n\nFACE FIRST ONTO THE PODIUM\n\nAs Barbara Niewiedzia\u0142 fell face first onto the Rio track, she could have been forgiven for wanting the ground to swallow her up.\n\nBut, as the Polish athlete tentatively got to her feet to survey the scoreboard, it emerged her tumble had proved uncommonly timely, bringing her the bronze medal in the women's T20 400-meter final ahead of her Malaysian rival by just four-hundredths of a second.\n\nTalk about winning by a nose...\n\nOUCH A Polish athlete faceplants on the finish line - but it helps her win #bronze by a nose... https://t.co/27AcMQyttv \u2014 C4 Paralympics (@C4Paralympics) September 14, 2016\n\nTHE FAIRYTALE OF ALEX ZANARDI\n\nIn one of the most emotive moments of Rio 2016, former F1 driver Alex Zanardi won paracycling gold on the eve of the 15-year anniversary of the crash that could have taken his life.\n\nBoth his car and body were severed in two at Germany's Eurospeedway that day; his heart stopped seven times, and the Italian was read the last rites with less than a liter of blood left in his body.\n\nBut refusing to let his devastating injury define him, he now calls his accident one of the greatest opportunities of his life.\n\n\"Normally I don't thank God for these type of things as I believe God has more important stuff to worry about, but today is too much, I had to raise my eyes and thank him,\" Zanardi told reporters after the race.\n\n\"I feel my life is a never-ending privilege.\"\n\nZanardi went on to win silver in the H5 men's road race a day later, before adding a second gold in the H2-5 mixed team relay.\n\nGRANDMA'S GIFT INSPIRES\n\nHaving collapsed to the floor in anguish after his Paralympic table tennis final defeat four years ago, Great Britain's Will Bayley crowned Rio 2016 gold by clambering up onto the table in elation.\n\nThis is how to celebrate a gold medal!!

    "text": "London (CNN) The Britain that Samuele Marcora fell in love with still exists: He can ride his motorbike along winding mountain roads and past unspoilt sandy beaches, laugh at stand-up comedy nights, enjoy live music at rock gigs, or meet his PhD students for coffee.\n\nAs long as he doesn't open his mouth.\n\nMarcora doesn't even have to talk in his mother tongue to spark a reaction: In his adopted hometown of Chatham in Kent, southeast of London, just speaking English with an Italian accent can be enough to provoke a reaction.\n\nThis is post-Brexit referendum Britain. And it's a place Marcora, who has lived and worked in the UK for 18 years, barely recognizes.\n\n\"I was Britain's biggest fan, pre-referendum,\" the physiology professor recalls. \"I was always very complimentary about it. Compared to Italy it's less chaotic, more meritocratic, more cosmopolitan.\"\n\n\"Then all of a sudden, you find out that a large part of the population don't feel that way. They don't want you here ... I've been rejected by the British people.\"\n\n100 days ago, Britons went to the polls to vote on whether the country's future lay inside or outside the European Union. After a bitter campaign that focused largely on immigration, a majority of voters backed Brexit, signalling the UK's departure from the EU after more than 40 years.\n\nThat decision has left many of the 3.2 million EU citizens living in the UK in limbo as Britain decides how it will Brexit. Will they be allowed to stay? And do they want to live in a country that voted to leave?\n\n'I don't feel welcome'\n\nTanja Bueltmann says she saw Brexit coming a long way off. Living in the northeast of England, one of the most eurosceptic areas of the UK, and active on Twitter, where she has frequently been attacked for her pro-EU stance, she was well aware of the rising tide of support for a Leave vote.\n\n\"I've no idea why anyone thought it would be otherwise,\" the German-born history lecturer, who has spent 10 years in the UK, says. \"I don't understand how the polls got it so wrong.\"\n\n\"The EU is what brought me here, so if 50% voted against it, then I'm not wanted here,\" says Tanja Bueltmann.\n\nKerstin Albers (not her real name) says she, too, saw the writing on the wall -- but after 13 years in Britain, was nonetheless taken aback by the final results.\n\nAlbers and her family, also originally from Germany, were so concerned about the growth of anti-EU sentiment across the country that they began planning for a future outside the UK long before the first ballots were cast.\n\n\"Over the past two years, the atmosphere in the UK has changed towards EU migrants. I don't feel welcome here [any more] ... [It was] such a tolerant and open society, and we have enjoyed being part of it, but now it feels different.\"\n\nShe decided to take pre-emptive action: \"I am sad to leave friends, but at the same time, I don't want to sit here for two years and wait.\"\n\nJust weeks after the Brexit vote, she was offered a new teaching job back in Germany. The Albers' youngest daughter, who was just four when the family moved to the UK, is still at school, so she and her father will stay in England until she finishes her A-levels -- the family now divided between two countries.\n\nAlbers says the Brexit vote was \"very disappointing.\" However, she also considers her family lucky: \"We are not refugees, so we can go back. I'm more sorry for you, because I have 27 other countries I can go to.\"\n\nBrexit heartbreak\n\nFor others, the decision whether to leave or stay is more complicated.\n\nSara Calamassi grew up in Brussels, and first came to the UK as a student in the early 2000s. She moved here permanently 11 years ago, and later married the boyfriend she'd met at university.\n\nShe says the \"most horrible thing\" about Brexit has been \"to wake up the day after and see my husband so disappointed in his country.\"\n\nCalamassi and others interviewed by CNN say they are deeply concerned at the impact of Brexit on their ties with friends and loved ones in less EU-friendly areas.\n\n\"London is my home, but I studied in Scotland, my husband is from North Wales, and most of my friends are from other areas of the country,\" she says.\n\n\"I always identified a lot with Britain ... I love other parts of the UK, but I don't feel comfortable going there now. I don't really want to go out into the country of the 52%,\" she says. \"I want to stay here with the 48%.\"\n\nHate crime rising\n\nIn Harlow, Essex, an area with high levels of Eastern European expats -- and a high Leave vote -- Polish man Arkadiusz \"Arek\" Jozwik was attacked and left for dead in August; police are treating his killing as a possible hate crime.\n\nJUST WATCHED This town voted to leave the EU, what do they think now? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This town voted to leave the EU, what do they think now? 01:58\n\n\"Britain won the Olympics of xenophobia,\" on June 23, says physiology professor Marcora. He says he's seen this hatred of foreigners at first hand.\n\n\"I wouldn't go talking Italian in one of the pubs in Chatham town center or in Gillingham (another nearby town). I wouldn't feel safe.\" Even in \"slightly posher\" Rochester, he says, someone yelled at him to \"Go home!\" when they heard him speak.\n\nAnd he says his wife, who is Chinese and \"recognizably an immigrant\" has been subjected to even worse treatment.\n\nHaving undergone a mastectomy as a result of breast cancer, she went to a local chemist to collect a prescription, only to be told \"your drugs are very expensive!\" He said she was made to feel as though she did not deserve the National Health Service (NHS) medication as a person who wasn't born in Britain.\n\n\"[The tablets] cost \u00a388 a month, and we pay our taxes,\" says a clearly angry Marcora. \"All through the campaign there were stories about health tourism, about 'immigrants' coming in to get treatment, but it is unbelievable that someone would say that, that they felt allowed to say it.\"\n\nBest and brightest flee\n\nA small survey carried out by the pro-Remain group Academics for Europe found that 71% of those questioned were thinking about leaving the UK in the wake of Brexit.\n\nBoin Cheong grew up in Berlin, but has made London her home. Now she's not so sure about that decision.\n\n\"I really don't see my long term future in this country,\" she says. \"I've started looking at other places.\"\n\n\"I want to leave because I feel unwelcome, but also because it feels like there's no bright future here anymore.\"\n\nBoin Cheong says the referendum made her question \"Why am I here? People don't want us here.\"\n\nShe fears the UK will be left facing the double-whammy of a recession and a brain drain of its brightest talent if Brexit goes ahead.\n\nBueltmann agrees that a mass exodus of European expats from the UK would have a huge negative effect on the country -- on universities like hers, and particularly on the NHS, where it would have \"massive repercussions.\"\n\n\"We need every EU migrant in the UK not to work for one day to demonstrate the impact it would have in universities, hospitals, everywhere,\" she says.\n\nFor now, at least, Calamassi will stay put -- but she says she no longer feels at home in the UK.\n\n\"I'm working towards British citizenship at the moment, which is kind of weird, to be doing that for a country that doesn't want me.\"",

Mayer, purchased the Evanston home \u2014 entertaining guests in the top floor ballroom or sitting beside its five fireplaces.\n\nFollowing Mayer\u2019s death here in the mid-1960s, the home was sold and fell into disrepair.

Modern touches in the kitchen and bathrooms pay tribute to the mansion\u2019s past, proving Oscar Mayer had a way with bologna and much more.\n\nAfter the extensive work, the asking price for the historic, six-bedroom home is just shy of $3 million.",

In 2012, it opened its doors at midnight. A year later it opened at 8:00 p.m. Last year, it opened at 6:00 p.m.\n\nNot only does giving the holiday off mean workers get to spend the day with their families, it also allows stores more time to get ready for one of the biggest shopping days of the year.\n\n\"We can shift the focus to Black Friday,\" said Renslow. \"To have that energy right at 5 in the morning and really bring that enthusiasm back.\"\n\nWhile no stores have yet confirmed they will be open on Thanksgiving, the mall will provide some support staff if that occurs.\n\nThe mall will still host the Walk to End Hunger on Thanksgiving morning.",

It came into Toronto having garnered acclaim from a number of movie critics and even Tom Hanks.\n\nFollowing its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival and screenings at both Colorado's Telluride Film Festival and Toronto, \"La La Land\" is now on, if not at the top of, many critics lists of early Oscars favorites.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) When quadruple amputee and retired Marine Sgt. John Peck looks down at his new arms, he said, he's overcome with gratitude -- and vows that he will not take them for granted.\n\nPeck soon will be able to use his arms to open heavy doors with circular handles, shake the hands of others and feel fianc\u00e9e Jessica Paker's palm in his.\n\n\"That truly is a precious gift,\" Peck said, with a cross around his neck and tears in his eyes, at a news conference at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston on Wednesday.\n\nThe 31-year-old wounded veteran underwent a bilateral arm transplant at the hospital in August. A donor's two arms were surgically connected to Peck's body near his elbows, which doctors say will allow him to eventually feel, grasp and hold in a way that prosthetics couldn't.\n\n\"Would I ever imagine being here? No. I still to this day tell people about the arm transplant, and they say, 'Whoa, they can do that?' And I say, 'Yeah, they can do face, limbs,' \" Peck said. \"People think it's sci-fi.\"\n\nA moment Peck will never forget\n\nPeck's life completely changed in 2010. During his second tour of duty, he stepped on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan, which triggered a blast that caused him to lose his arms and legs.\n\nThat wasn't the first time Peck was injured. He'd previously served a tour in Iraq, where he suffered a traumatic brain injury. He's the recipient of two Purple Hearts\n\nJUST WATCHED Boy celebrates one year since double hand transplant Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Boy celebrates one year since double hand transplant 01:52\n\nAfter losing his limbs, Peck was equipped with prosthetic arms and a wheelchair. However, in 2014, he was approved to undergo a double arm transplant, in which he would receive real arms from another young man -- a man who died.\n\n\"I will love him every day and will respect his life and this gift until the day I die,\" Peck said during Wednesday's conference, where he requested that an empty chair be placed next to him to represent and honor his donor.\n\nJUST WATCHED Boy is first child to get double hand transplant Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Boy is first child to get double hand transplant 01:03\n\nFor Peck's surgery, a team of 12 surgeons worked nearly 14 hours to complete the transplant. The date and time of the surgery was not disclosed in order to protect the privacy of the donor's family, hospital officials said.\n\nThe procedure, which can be performed simultaneously on both arms, involved trimming the ends of the bones in Peck's arms and equipping them with plates, which were then connected to the bones in the donor arms.\n\nNext, the surgeons connected the arteries and veins in Peck's arms to those in the donor's. As Peck's blood flowed into the donor arms, the donor hands turned pink, the doctors explained during the conference.\n\nOnce doctors repaired the muscles in Peck's arms, connected his nerves to those in the donor arms and sewed the connecting skin closed, the transplantation was complete.\n\nPeck then went into recovery.\n\n'Every day, it's a learning experience, and I love it'\n\nPeck's surgery was led by Dr. Simon Talbot, director of the upper extremity transplant program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Dr. David Crandall, medical director of the Amputee Program at Spaulding Rehabilitation Network, where Peck has been undergoing outpatient recovery.\n\n\"In physical therapy, John has been working on his core and shoulder strengthening,\" Crandall said Wednesday. \"John has been working on functional tasks of daily living including some self-dressing, grooming and teeth brushing.\"\n\nBut it will take about nine to 12 months for Peck to feel sensations, Talbot said.\n\n\"We've had patients who get their sensations back, and it comes back quite suddenly in the palm of the hand. Most patients say, 'One day I could suddenly feel a raindrop on my hand' or 'the pages of a book I'm turning,' \" Talbot said. However, in some cases, sensation might fail to return.\n\nJeff Kepner, now 64, was the first patient to receive a double hand transplant in the United States, in 2009. One year after his surgery, he was still taking 50 pills a day and completing six hours of therapy every weekday to regain some function of his new hands.\n\n\"Unfortunately, things have not worked out as he had hoped,\" Kepner's family wrote on a GoFundMe page that was set up for his medical expenses.\n\nHowever, Peck is hopeful for his future. The resident of Fredericksburg, Virginia, was the fourth bilateral transplant performed at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"The pain has been tremendous at first. There was one night in the ICU, I believe it was the first night, that I had a bad night, and I wanted to call Dr. Talbot and tell him to come re-amputate my arms. It was a moment of weakness,\" Peck said of his recovery.\n\nBut now, \"I'm learning how to transfer in and out of bed. I'm making really good milestones pretty fast,\" he said. \"Every day, it's a learning experience, and I love it.\"\n\nChasing a culinary dream\n\nPeck said he plans to pursue a culinary career and compete in the television series \" Food Network Star \" with his new arms, of which the upper left shows remnants of an old tattoo.\n\n\"My dream job since I was 12 was to be a chef, and because of my donor's gift, I actually have a fighting chance to do this,\" Peck said. \"As a result of this surgery, I'll be able to pursue my dreams.\"\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nPeck added that, for now, he has to be careful in the kitchen. Any injury, such as a cut or burn, could be devastating for his recovery.\n\n\"Last night, we were making shrimp and chorizo, and I was watching the pan to make sure we didn't burn anything, and I had to make sure my arm was away from the pan to make sure any oil or anything like that didn't get on it. ... I don't want to get any scarring or any cuts or anything like that. It takes extra thought,\" Peck said.\n\nHe looked down at his arms and added, \"This gift, it's not going to go to waste at all.\"",

She is the author of 15 books, including The Forty Rules of Love and The Architect's Apprentice. The opinions expressed here are those of the author.\n\n(CNN) Turkey's newspapers this week documented the deep cracks appearing inside the treasury room of Istanbul's Topkapi Palace -- one of the country's top tourism destinations and once the home of Ottoman sultans. While older cracks had been covered with concrete, \"Hurriyet\" reported that parts of this iconic structure risk total collapse as a \"result of years of neglect of historical heritage.\"\n\nThese days, I often find myself thinking about similar cracks -- political fault lines and social fissures to be more specific -- appearing more and more across my motherland, Turkey. And there are many, way too many.\n\nElif Shafak\n\nTurkey's connection with its own past is beset by sharp ruptures. Ours is a society of collective amnesia. Everything is written in water over here, except the works of great architects, which are written in stone; and the words of great poets, which are written in our hearts. Everything else is or can someday be forgotten with a dizzying speed. Throughout the Anatolian peninsula, the clocks run so fast that there is no time to stop and think, let alone to digest. No time to heal. No time to grieve. No time to analyze. In this country, the deepest cracks are covered speedily with the thickest cement. And yet, never before have those cracks been as visible and as divisive as they are today.\n\nAnger is the new national currency. There is too much anger on all sides. Elif Shafak\n\nBitterly polarized\n\nTurkey is a bitterly and sadly polarized country. We have been divided into invisible cultural and political ghettos of citizens who do not break bread together anymore, let alone appreciate their shared values. Anger is the new national currency. There is too much anger on all sides. And distrust, that too. Nobody trusts the other. Against this fragmented and fractured background, anyone who speaks critically is immediately labeled as a betrayer.",
